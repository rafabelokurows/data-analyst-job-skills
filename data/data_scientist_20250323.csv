You independently conduct rigorous experiments while also contributing well-designed features to our codebase.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take responsibility and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees.

As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to accelerate transition to a sustainable planet. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as exploring new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.





Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.


Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.


Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs and ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring how AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.


Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction and helps achieve our mission.



Your profile

What type of person we're looking for...



Knowledgable and experienced with building AI/LLM products: You have strong knowledge and experience of thinking through and building AI/LLM systems from prototyping and experiments through to deployment, evaluation, monitoring and improvement in production.


Practical Implementer: You are a ‘builder’ and aim to pragmatically integrate AI into real-world products, moving beyond research to create tangible, impactful solutions.


Personal agency and drive: must have personal agency, drive and ability to figure things out, learn and iterate to drive initiatives forward to success.


Innovative Thinker: You're driven by curiosity and continually experiment with new models, techniques and technologies in the rapidly evolving AI/LLM space.


Excellent Communicator: You have outstanding verbal and written communication skills in English, and can build strong relationships with internal teams and external partners.


Collaborative and Organised: You thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve success. Preferably with experience in start-ups.


Passion for ESG and Sustainability: You are motivated by using your skills to help address climate change and enthusiastic about building tools that help ESG and sustainability teams.



Technical Skills



Minimum of 4 years of experience: As an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI/ML Product Engineer or related roles.


Fluency in python: Including strong proficiency with base python as well as modern frameworks (e.g. fastAPI)


Experience with LLMs: Including core concepts around foundation models, prompt engineering and chains etc. as well as preferably some experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain). Experience using LLMs to build RAG systems and/or other real-world use-cases related to document processing would be a major bonus.


Experience with LLM evaluation: Including how to collect labelled data and systematically evaluate RAG and other real world LLM applications, preferably with experience in evaluation tools and frameworks (e.g. Langsmith)


Experience with production grade applications: Including familiarity with software development tools and practices for production applications (e.g git, CI/CD, containerization) and preferably some experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment (e.g. GCP, Modal). Any experience with cost/latency implications of deploying LLMs at scale would be a major bonus.


Fluency in English: With the ability to clearly communicate complex topics to diverse stakeholders. Any other European language would be a bonus.


Understanding or interest in sustainability: Including an interest in sustainability climate, or ESG topics and a desire to use your skills to help accelerate the climate transition.
Even if your experience doesn’t align precisely with all the criteria, we encourage you to apply. Many people miss out on opportunities because they feel they don’t fit every requirement—we believe in growth, not perfection!



What we offer



Competitive Remuneration: As a core member of our team, you will receive a competitive salary and equity package, reflecting your role in shaping Briink’s future.


Purpose-Driven Mission: ESG data has the power to create a more sustainable world, but today it presents more challenges than solutions. We believe AI can change that. Be part of the transition to an AI-powered, sustainable world.


Flexible Working: Our work philosophy is built on flexibility. While we do like to come to the office (in Berlin or London) to collaborate in person, this is a hybrid role with opportunities for some remote work within European time zones.


Trust and Ownership: At Briink, we empower you to own your projects with the option for growing into new roles. We believe in giving people autonomy and trust to drive your own initiatives.


Dynamic Work Environment: Based at the Merantix AI Campus, Berlin’s hub for AI innovation, you’ll work in a diverse, collaborative environment. With frequent events and opportunities for cross-company collaboration, you’ll be part of a thriving ecosystem of AI startups and experts.


Learning budget and quarterly hackathons: We truly believe in the importance of curiosity and experimentation as both a learning opportunity and strategic advantage. We therefore have a learning budget to explore new technologies and regular hackathons to prototype new ideas.

truemetrics helps organizations to navigate the world more efficiently. We are solving one of the biggest pain points in last mile delivery: how to get parcels, groceries, and food to the right door faster and more efficiently.

Our technology sits in the smartphone of the courier and understands where they park and enter a building. Our technology is right now mapping locations in Kasachstan, Qatar, Germany, Switzerland, the UK and many other countries.

Who we are

We are a tech-driven, customer-obsessed company with a small but highly skilled team, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in mapping and positioning.

We thrive on autonomy, ownership, and speed—which means we’re looking for curious problem-solvers who love tackling hard challenges and making an immediate impact. If you want structure, rigid processes, and a slow corporate environment, this is not the place for you.

Why join us?


Real Impact: Solve practical challenges that help thousands of delivery drivers navigate cities more efficiently.
Collaborative Environment: Work closely with a tight-knit team of founders and engineers scaling the company.
Technical Depth: Tackle advanced problems in positioning, sensor fusion, and large-scale data processing.
Industry Shaping: Influence the future of AI-driven mapping technology in a rapidly growing sector.
Global Ambition: Join a startup partnering with top logistics companies like GLS, DPD, and Snoonu.
Dynamic Culture: Experience the fast-paced environment of a Silicon Valley-connected startup. We are backed by some of the most successful investors in the world like Y-Combinator, Soma Capital or Rebel Fund.


Why NOT to join us?

If you’re looking for a big team, a slow-paced environment, or a job where you can coast along without ownership, this probably isn’t the right fit. We move fast, iterate quickly, and expect everyone to contribute with initiative and creativity.

Requirements


You are based in Berlin or willing to relocate within four weeks of starting.
You thrive in a dynamic startup environment, where fast development cycles and quick deployment are essential.

Data Visualization & Data Science: You enjoy making complex data understandable and have a solid background in Data Science or Mathematics, especially in working with geospatial data.
Cloud Expertise: You are familiar with AWS architecture and comfortable working with serverless tools (e.g., AWS Lambda, Athena, S3).
Customer-Focused Mindset: You enjoy working closely with customers, helping them get the most out of the product, and explaining technical concepts in an accessible way.
Allrounder: You are fine with switching between roles. Sometimes you are a project manager, sometimes a Data Scientist, sometimes a Backend engineer or QA engineer.

Your Role at Truemetrics

Data Exploration, Analysis & Improvement


Analyze and prepare data: By preparing data in a way that is easy to understand, you ensure our customers receive meaningful insights.
Customer Success & Onboarding: You help present our product to customers and continuously improve the early onboarding experience.
Support POCs & Pilot Projects: You help manage proof-of-concept (POC) and pilot projects, ensuring smooth execution and learning opportunities.


Software Engineering


Troubleshooting & Data Quality: If something breaks in our data, you investigate the root cause and propose solutions. If everything burns, you are playing the detective to find out what didn’t went well
Prototyping & Innovation: You design and implement early prototypes for new features and contribute ideas for improving our algorithms and data processing techniques.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Data Scientist (d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work on interdisciplinary projects to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. Together with your colleagues you apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems. You independently conduct rigorous experiments while also contributing well-designed features to our codebase.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take responsibility and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Experience in using a wide range of ML frameworks such as SKLearn, Tensorflow, Torch in production. Experience with domain specific libraries like OpenCV, HuggingFace etc are an advantage.


Good written and verbal communication in both English and German. Most of our clients are German speaking so a level of at least B2 is required for the role.


Resident in Germany. Due to the size of the company, we cannot currently accept applications from other EU/non-EU countries.





We explicitly do not hire anyone who discriminates against people on the basis of religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status or other aspects. We encourage people from LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented groups to apply.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Machine Learning Engineer(d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

They are underwriting leaders in their fields and are very focused on the data and analytics which underpin the pricing/underwriting techniques for a new portfolio and partnership underwriting division which is undergoing significant growth.




A maths/actuarial background with strong data science understanding is the preference.

Insurance exposure is essential, as is the interest in a diverse career in underwriting - historically this type of role has suited a traditional underwriting background, with developing client and partner relationships. Whilst someone who is interested in the process of the partnerships, and the growth of underwriting alongside this would be beneficial, the true focus of finding the right candidate for this, is finding someone who has the data background and wants to utilise this much more closely with the business.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.




Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.




Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.




As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:





Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.




Requirements





A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact


Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are looking for a talented Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer to join our dynamic data team at Mumsnet. You will play a key role in building data-driven products and leveraging AI/LLM technologies to enhance our platform and user experience. Your work will have a direct impact on our 9 million users, driving innovation through machine learning and data analytics.

You will be responsible for designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models, as well as integrating AI-driven solutions via APIs. Strong communication skills are essential, as you will collaborate with teams across product, engineering, and commercial to translate their requirements into actual data products. We have successfully built our very own AI platform, MumsGPT, which is a combination of AI-agents that bring together and analyse all Mumsnet's qualitative and quantitative data in a super efficient and user friendly way. In this role, you will be responsible for maintaining and improving the platform as well as building new ML/AI driven data products.

This is a fantastic opportunity to be part of an exciting, growing team that is shaping the future of Mumsnet with cutting-edge data science and AI solutions.

What You'll Be Doing

Every day in the Mumsnet data team is different. We work with web traffic, textual data, and large datasets to develop new data products and AI-powered features. Your responsibilities will include:


Machine Learning & AI Development:
Designing, training, and deploying machine learning models for predictive analytics, personalization, and automation, with a particular focus on NLP applications
Leveraging AI/LLMs (e.g., GPT, Gemini, LLaMA) for content moderation, entity extraction, analysing and summarising huge amounts of text data, and other business needs
Data Product Development:
Building and maintaining scalable data products, pipelines, and REST APIs
Implementing ML models in production, ensuring performance, monitoring, and scalability
Data Engineering & Analytics:
Working with ingestion and processing of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources
Collaborating with team members to optimize data infrastructure and ETL workflows
Stakeholder Collaboration & Communication:
Partnering with the product team to implement data-driven features
Presenting insights and recommendations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Documenting and sharing best practices for AI/ML model development


Why work for us?

We focus on steady, sustainable growth, putting purpose (to make parent's lives easier) before profit. We expect great performance, agility and collaboration in every role; cross-team working with talented, clever people is the best part of life at Mumsnet. Most importantly we're looking for candidates with a growth mindset - we know everyone makes mistakes, the important thing is to learn from them and to share your learnings.

We embraced flexible and home working a long time before COVID, and we care much more about outputs than hours on the clock. We don't only want to hire the best people: we want to retain them. If you need some flexibility, let us know and we'll do our best.

We're committed to diversity and quality (see our policy ) and we think we're second to none in the all-round support we offer to parents and carers at work (see our parental leave policies ). Working for Mumsnet means never having to pretend you don't have a family or other commitments, and we promise never to keep you away from a school appointment. We are also proud to be a London Living Wage employer and we have never used unpaid interns.

We have a healthy line-up of sandwich lunches, knowledge sessions, book clubs, yoga sessions, monthly socials and sports teams, as well as an unhealthy line-up of staff parties at Kentish Town's excellent pubs and restaurants, and McDonald's deliveries for the mornings after.

WFH

We've continued to embrace flexibility and remote working to the max. You'll only be required to be in the office two days a week (although you can go in more often if you wish). We're flexible with hours and happy to accommodate personal commitments like picking the kids up from school. We're more interested in output than presenteeism, so if you need to move things around, we can probably work it out.

How We'll Support You


Weekly or bi-weekly 1-1 with line manager to review progress, agree roles, provide support;
Formal 6-month appraisal system;
Buddy and Mentor Programmes;
LinkedIn online learning - bi-weekly DEAL(Drop Everything And Learn) sessions, training to be agreed with your line manager;
Ongoing on the job training from your line manager


This role sits within our data team and reports into the Chief Data Officer and is based at our offices in Kentish Town. This role is envisaged as full-time but we are happy to consider flexible options for the right candidate.

If all of this sounds good to you, please apply with your CV and a covering letter that demonstrates some of the qualities we're looking for.

Requirements


Technical Skills:
Strong proficiency in Python and relevant frameworks/libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, LangChain, LangGraph, Hugging Face, etc.)
Experience working with LLMs and AI models in production environments
Experience building RAG-based applications and vector databases

Excellent problem-solving skills, ability to work independently and in a team
Strong communication skills, with the ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Understanding of ML fundamentals and experience with ML frameworks
Advanced coursework in math, statistics, and machine learning preferred
Demonstrable attention to detail


Desired Experience


Experience in the energy or commodities trading industry, with knowledge of financial markets and trading concepts
Experience integrating machine learning systems into interactive dashboards (e.g. Dash, Streamlit) and present use cases of machine learning to non-technical colleagues
Application of a wide range of ML methodologies to real life applications
Enterprise software development (systems design, code review, version control, etc.)
Data orchestrators (Airflow, Dagster) and cloud-based ETL/ELT pipelines
Awareness of continuous integration and delivery concepts/technologies


Additional Information

Personal Characteristics


A self-motivated individual who thrives on seeing the results of their work make an impact in the business

We are looking for a talented Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer to join our dynamic data team at Mumsnet. You will play a key role in building data-driven products and leveraging AI/LLM technologies to enhance our platform and user experience. Your work will have a direct impact on our 9 million users, driving innovation through machine learning and data analytics.

You will be responsible for designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models, as well as integrating AI-driven solutions via APIs. Strong communication skills are essential, as you will collaborate with teams across product, engineering, and commercial to translate their requirements into actual data products. We have successfully built our very own AI platform, MumsGPT, which is a combination of AI-agents that bring together and analyse all Mumsnet's qualitative and quantitative data in a super efficient and user friendly way. In this role, you will be responsible for maintaining and improving the platform as well as building new ML/AI driven data products.

This is a fantastic opportunity to be part of an exciting, growing team that is shaping the future of Mumsnet with cutting-edge data science and AI solutions.

What You'll Be Doing

Every day in the Mumsnet data team is different. We work with web traffic, textual data, and large datasets to develop new data products and AI-powered features. Your responsibilities will include:


Machine Learning & AI Development:
Designing, training, and deploying machine learning models for predictive analytics, personalization, and automation, with a particular focus on NLP applications
Leveraging AI/LLMs (e.g., GPT, Gemini, LLaMA) for content moderation, entity extraction, analysing and summarising huge amounts of text data, and other business needs
Data Product Development:
Building and maintaining scalable data products, pipelines, and REST APIs
Implementing ML models in production, ensuring performance, monitoring, and scalability
Data Engineering & Analytics:
Working with ingestion and processing of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources
Collaborating with team members to optimize data infrastructure and ETL workflows
Stakeholder Collaboration & Communication:
Partnering with the product team to implement data-driven features
Presenting insights and recommendations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Documenting and sharing best practices for AI/ML model development


Why work for us?

We focus on steady, sustainable growth, putting purpose (to make parent's lives easier) before profit. We expect great performance, agility and collaboration in every role; cross-team working with talented, clever people is the best part of life at Mumsnet. Most importantly we're looking for candidates with a growth mindset - we know everyone makes mistakes, the important thing is to learn from them and to share your learnings.

We embraced flexible and home working a long time before COVID, and we care much more about outputs than hours on the clock. We don't only want to hire the best people: we want to retain them. If you need some flexibility, let us know and we'll do our best.

We're committed to diversity and quality (see our policy ) and we think we're second to none in the all-round support we offer to parents and carers at work (see our parental leave policies ). Working for Mumsnet means never having to pretend you don't have a family or other commitments, and we promise never to keep you away from a school appointment. We are also proud to be a London Living Wage employer and we have never used unpaid interns.

We have a healthy line-up of sandwich lunches, knowledge sessions, book clubs, yoga sessions, monthly socials and sports teams, as well as an unhealthy line-up of staff parties at Kentish Town's excellent pubs and restaurants, and McDonald's deliveries for the mornings after.

WFH

We've continued to embrace flexibility and remote working to the max. You'll only be required to be in the office two days a week (although you can go in more often if you wish). We're flexible with hours and happy to accommodate personal commitments like picking the kids up from school. We're more interested in output than presenteeism, so if you need to move things around, we can probably work it out.

How We'll Support You


Weekly or bi-weekly 1-1 with line manager to review progress, agree roles, provide support;
Formal 6-month appraisal system;
Buddy and Mentor Programmes;
LinkedIn online learning - bi-weekly DEAL(Drop Everything And Learn) sessions, training to be agreed with your line manager;
Ongoing on the job training from your line manager


This role sits within our data team and reports into the Chief Data Officer and is based at our offices in Kentish Town. This role is envisaged as full-time but we are happy to consider flexible options for the right candidate.

If all of this sounds good to you, please apply with your CV and a covering letter that demonstrates some of the qualities we're looking for.

Requirements


Technical Skills:
Strong proficiency in Python and relevant frameworks/libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, LangChain, LangGraph, Hugging Face, etc.)
Experience working with LLMs and AI models in production environments
Experience building RAG-based applications and vector databases
Experience with graph databases like Neo4J or Memgraph
Hands-on experience with SQL and cloud platforms (GCP, AWS, or Azure)

We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.




Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.




Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.




As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:





Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.




Requirements





A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact


Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

About BuildOps:

BuildOps is a fast-paced, high-growth start-up committed to transforming a $300B+ industry through an innovative all-in-one SaaS platform. Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking Commercial Specialty Contractors from the world of pen and paper to cloud-based, data-driven operations. Our leadership team has deep experience in both the Construction and SaaS technology industries, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful start-up exits.

BuildOps has more than doubled year-over-year while raising over $140 million in total funding (including a recent round in Feb 2024). Top-tier investors like Founders Fund, Siemens, B Capital Group (BCG's venture arm), 01 Advisors, and more have backed BuildOps! Also, Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, just joined our board, adding to an impressive group of investors/advisors including former President of Salesforce, Gavin Patterson; CAA founder Michael Ovitz; NFL legend Joe Montana; former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

About BuildOps:

BuildOps is a fast-paced, high-growth start-up committed to transforming a $300B+ industry through an innovative all-in-one SaaS platform. Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking Commercial Specialty Contractors from the world of pen and paper to cloud-based, data-driven operations. Our leadership team has deep experience in both the Construction and SaaS technology industries, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful start-up exits.

BuildOps has more than doubled year-over-year while raising over $140 million in total funding (including a recent round in Feb 2024). Top-tier investors like Founders Fund, Siemens, B Capital Group (BCG's venture arm), 01 Advisors, and more have backed BuildOps! Also, Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, just joined our board, adding to an impressive group of investors/advisors including former President of Salesforce, Gavin Patterson; CAA founder Michael Ovitz; NFL legend Joe Montana; former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.

We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.

Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.

Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.

Our guiding principles:


Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

We’re Quandri, our mission is to unlock the world’s insurance data so brokerages and agencies can best serve their clients. Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business. 




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted.

Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner.  We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:

The range for base pay is 100$k - 125$k which is dependent on level of experience, performance and choice of stock option compensation
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
Four weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 calendar days of the year
