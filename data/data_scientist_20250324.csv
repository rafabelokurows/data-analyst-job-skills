More than 40% of all fresh produce is wasted in the US, which accounts for over 17 billion dollars in lost product annually and contributes more carbon dioxide emissions than all of US transportation combined. Globally, food that is never consumed accounts for 7% of the global freshwater supply and 308MM hectares of land. Our goal is to reduce these drastic numbers by making the produce supply chain smarter through data-driven decisions.




Strella uses proprietary sensors to predict shelf life in the food supply chain. We use this information to reduce food waste and help deliver better quality produce to consumers. We have been commercialized for 5 years and are currently in our growth stage.




Role

We are looking for an ambitious data scientist with 3+ years of experience to help us build the next generation of our modeling and prediction engine. The applicant must have a strong focus on delivering action-based results that can help customers make better decisions using data. Experience in agriculture is a plus. 




As a startup, we seek applicants who are self-starters and can wear multiple hats. We are in a rapid growth stage and are looking for people who thrive in a fast-paced environment while maintaining quality. This is an in-person role in either our Seattle or Wenatchee WA office.




Responsibilities

​Partner with developers, product managers, and business partners to frame problems mathematically and in the right business context
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the problem
Construct and fit statistical, machine learning, or optimization models
Implement advanced analytics techniques to identify key factors impacting the quality and shelf life of fruits
Develop predictive models and machine-learning algorithms to predict the shelf life of different types of fruits
Design experimentation strategies for evaluating our models
Collaborate with developers to implement algorithms in production
Analyze experimental and observational data; communicate findings; facilitate launch decisions




Skills




Bachelors, M.S. or Ph.D. in Machine Learning, Statistics, Operations Research, Optimization, Computer Science, or other quantitative fields or related work experience
3+ years of professional experience, startup experience required
Proficiency in causal inference, experimentation, signal processing, and/or machine learning
Proficiency with Python and working in a production coding environment
Passion for solving unstructured and non-standard mathematical problems
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Strong oral and written communication skills, and ability to collaborate and communicate with others to solve a problem

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $166,000 - $195,000 per year.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $136,000 - $230,000 per year.

We work together to give everyone the power to share their story, explore what they love, and connect with one another in the process. Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun — and we do it all together.

Lila Sciences is a privately held, early-stage technology company pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to transform every aspect of the scientific method. Lila Sciences is backed by Flagship Pioneering, which brings the courage, long-term vision, and resources needed to realize unreasonable results. Join our mission-driven team and contribute to the future of science.

We are leveraging AI across both Life Sciences and Physical Sciences to transform the process of invention and discovery,

At Lila Sciences, we are uniquely cross-functional and collaborative. We are actively reimagining the way teams work together and communicate. Therefore, we seek individuals with an inclusive mindset and a diversity of thought. Our teams thrive in unstructured and creative environments. All voices are heard because we know that experience comes in many forms, skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

The Role

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

Candidates should have experience and/or interest in some or all of:


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


Qualifications:


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


Working at Lila, you would have access to advanced technology in the areas of:


AI experimental design and simulation
Automated custom instrumentation
Generative molecular and material design

Why work at Abridge?

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

How we take care of Abridgers:


Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.
Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.
Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.
401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.
Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.
Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.
Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.
Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.
... and much more!

Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense. We have offices located in the SoDo neighborhood of New York, the Mission District in San Francisco, and Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh.

The Role

From transcribing medical conversations to delivering key takeaways, our trailblazing work in machine learning research makes the Abridge experience possible. We're currently looking to hire research scientists with experience in machine learning and natural language processing. The ideal candidate will bring technical mastery, fluency with foundation models, genuine interest in the medical domain, and strong critical thinking skills to the role. At Abridge, all of our ML work has a strong research component, and all of our research scientists contribute directly to real products that impact the lives of doctors.

What You'll Do


Advance the state of the art in medical NLP, in areas including conversation summarization, evidence extraction, outcome prediction, evaluation techniques, and experimentation.
Actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing original research
Help to define important problems, identify appropriate baselines, develop state-of-the-art methods, and ship them into production.
Dial deeply into real-time feedback from clinicians to guide further refinements and innovations
Be results-oriented in the face of ambiguous problems and uncertain outcomes


What You'll Bring


Strong research background, as demonstrated through papers and a graduate degree (MS or PhD) in Electrical Engineering, Computer Sciences, Mathematics, or equivalent experience.
High-impact publications at peer-reviewed AI conferences (e.g. *CL, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Significant real-world impact, as demonstrated through open source contributions and deployed technology.
Strong programming skills with proven experience crafting, prototyping, and delivering machine learning solutions into production.
Experience with deep learning libraries (e.g. PyTorch, Jax, Tensorflow) and platforms, multi-GPU training, and statistical analyses of observational and experimental data.


Base Salary: $200,000 USD - $300,000+ USD per year + Equity

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco and New York City metro areas. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

Must be willing to work from our SF office at least 3x per week

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco within 6 months of accepting an offer.

We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

Why work at Abridge?

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

How we take care of Abridgers:


Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.
Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.
Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.
401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.
Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.
Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.
Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.
Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.
... and much more!


Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

We Are Humble. We like hard work, but don’t make work hard. We know we have a lot to learn and never grandstand or take up all the space in the room. We are kind. We are welcoming. We are inspired by our mission to decarbonize the grid.

We Create the Future. We are curious. We go deep, search for the best idea, and then move fast. We always focus on the few things that matter most. We know there will be setbacks, so we show up every day ready to learn and be better, together.

We Show Up for Each Other. We keep each other fully informed. We seek to understand. We coach, we don’t blame. We share our points of view and seek to make each other better every day. We believe everyone creates culture in every moment, every day.

We Do Hard Things. We view challenges as opportunities. We are resilient. We are all owners, and we act like it. We understand change requires taking risks and we push ourselves and our partners. We do what is right as opposed to what might be best for any one of us.

Our platform, which reinvents expensive and time-consuming accounting processes, is the first step in our vision to unlock the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on manual insurance operations.

Our Series B, announced in early 2025, led by BOND & Workday, comes on the heels of record growth and accelerating expansion plans.

Why you should consider joining


Record-setting growth, having gone from zero to 8-figure ARR within three years of founding, representing 95th+ percentile company growth among startups that achieve these revenue milestones
Strong product market fit revealed in growth and through customer love, with users describing the platform as “the best thing since sliced bread” and ""life-changing""
Our lean, talented team is creating category-defining products for large public and private enterprises, driving 7-figure ROI and cash-flow operations, providing the best of both worlds: outsized employee ownership and low company risk
We're continuing to take big, ambitious first-to-market bets for a highly committed customer base and an exciting pipeline of new customers
We’re in the early innings of our vision and poised to take advantage of the massive opportunity to deploy AI into core workflows throughout the insurance industry


About The Role

We're hiring an Applied Data Scientist to join us onsite in San Francisco. Our product is growing incredibly quickly, generating a massive dataset. But the insurance back office remains mired in manual processes. You'll have the opportunity to capitalize on this by building predictive models and AI-powered tools to transform what's possible for our customers.

Who you are


3+ years experience leveraging data-driven analysis and predictive modeling to drive key business decisions
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases
Contributed to predictive systems in a production environment
Excellent written and verbal communication skills; ability to clearly explain your work and collaborate with stakeholders
Comfortable with handling ambiguity and working in a self-directed manner
Curiosity about different industries and the data + business context within them


Projects you might work on


Leverage the latest models to build agents automating natural language-based workflows
Build a system to orchestrate + optimize the processing of millions of transactions
Analyze the efficacy of a new product launch & recommend + drive product improvements


Our team & philosophy

We’re backed by BOND, Spark Capital, Neo, and Workday, as well as founders/executives from Brex, Asana, Plaid, Applied Intuition, Coalition, and more.

Our team hails from companies like Airbnb, Google, Brex, and LiveRamp and we’re fairly low-profile: focusing the majority of our energy on delivering for customers and building a category-defining company.

We’re hiring predominantly in San Francisco 🌁, as we believe in-person collaboration is strategically important for a company at our stage — both for velocity and company culture.

Benefits


Competitive base salary and generous equity
Generous medical, dental, and vision benefits
401K plan enrollment
Flexible time-off policy
Lunch & dinner every day
Paid parental leave
Company outings and offsites
(and more benefits as we grow!)


Comulate is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture that celebrates authenticity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, protected veteran status, or any other legally protected characteristics.

Compensation Range: $150K - $200K

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

Data Scientist (Business Operations)

The Business Operations Team at Wolt focuses on solving country- and region-specific marketplace challenges and is tasked with growing revenue and profitability. To do this, the team works to understand the underlying drivers of growth at the market level and identifies the best opportunities to have an impact.

We take on a diverse set of challenging questions in the geospatial, logistics, and economics spaces, focused on helping balance Wolt's multi-sided marketplace across an ecosystem of courier partners, customers, and merchant partners to achieve our topline and bottomline plans. Our work sees us optimizing the experience of our customers, contributing to providing growing income opportunities for our courier partners and merchants, and driving growth, efficiency, and profitability for Wolt overall.

We work with operations teams across 30 markets globally. Our core work covers customer retention, the economic efficiency of all our markets, and geospatial analysis - but our scope frequently expands to tackle issues beyond these topics.

The role

In this role, you will work closely with the regional leadership team, partnering with our General Managers and heads of operations and marketing in multiple markets.

This isn’t a normal Data Science role. You’ll combine strong technical skills and business acumen to partner with our regional leadership team. You will be the regional expert on connecting the dots across the business to help optimize our multi-sided marketplace. You will provide recommendations and consultation on business-critical issues through rigorous analysis paired with structured, big-picture thinking.

Day-to-day activities


Running data-driven research to uncover new insights and opportunities to help drive growth in the regions and fast track our operational strategy on a daily and weekly basis.
Working with Country GMs and Heads of Marketing and Operations to size and prioritize initiatives.
Some traveling to the local markets is expected.


About You

You’re not the typical Data Scientist. You have a passion for understanding the details behind the numbers and finding opportunities that really help the business hit its goals rather than building perfect models.

You understand how to balance rigor with speed and can help your business stakeholders navigate those tradeoffs as well.


3-5 years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or a related quantitative role.
Ability to delve into ambiguous problems for “treasure-hunting” with data and find creative new ways to think about our business.
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team.
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem-solving.
Proficiency in at least one programming language, preferably Python.
Ability to support & influence senior leadership in making critical decisions.


Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

This is a rare chance to join at the earliest stage, shaping a data function from the ground up. The company is building an intelligence platform where AI and data-driven insights will be central to the product, and they need someone who can take models from concept to production. You’ll have real ownership, making key decisions on data strategy while working hands-on with predictive models, multiple data sources and large language models.




The team moves fast, with no layers of bureaucracy. You’ll work closely with founders and engineers, solving complex problems with real commercial impact. If you thrive in an early-stage environment and want to make a meaningful contribution, this is the perfect role.




What you need:

Strong Python and SQL skills
Experience building and deploying predictive models
Hands-on experience with LLMs, designing prompts, RAG, vector databases
Knowledge of modern AI tooling and techniques
A problem-solving mindset and a bias towards action




Interview process:

3 calls with the founders, a quick chat to start followed by a technical round, then a culture-fit round at the end.




Location:

Remote-friendly from Ireland, they have an office in Dublin if you want to pop in from time to time.




Unfortunately sponsorship is not available, EU/UK passport or Stamp 4/1G Spousal is required.

Eneco has the ambition to lead the energy transition. We excel in the complete chain from energy producing assets to serving customers. This integrated approach connects all Eneco employees and enables us to fulfil our mission. You can feel it throughout the whole organisation, and it leads to multidisciplinary innovations such as Toon, e-Mobility and our Virtual Power Plant.




You are going to work at a company large enough to effect real change, within a digital department that has the flexibility to rival a start-up. Our organization is open and brimming with energy. At Eneco, anyone with a sharp mind and a positive and active mindset can contribute to a more sustainable world.




Create data driven innovations, services, and products for the whole company.




In Eneco’s digital data science team you will set up data-driven solutions together with other business units.

Eneco has the ambition to lead the energy transition. We excel in the complete chain from energy producing assets to serving customers. This integrated approach connects all Eneco employees and enables us to fulfil our mission. You can feel it throughout the whole organisation, and it leads to multidisciplinary innovations such as Toon, e-Mobility and our Virtual Power Plant.




You are going to work at a company large enough to effect real change, within a digital department that has the flexibility to rival a start-up. Our organization is open and brimming with energy. At Eneco, anyone with a sharp mind and a positive and active mindset can contribute to a more sustainable world.




Create data driven innovations, services, and products for the whole company.




In Eneco’s digital data science team you will set up data-driven solutions together with other business units. This means you can work on a wide variety of topics on the commercial and the operational side of Eneco, as well as the integration between those two.

As an integrated energy company, Eneco is also always looking for innovative solutions to integrate supply and demand. In all these projects, adding value both for the customer and for Eneco is key.




Energy companies have large amounts of data available to work with, and Eneco is a leader in this field, for example from our smart thermostat Toon. The big question is: how will you leverage this data? Distributed energy generation and changes in energy demand have upended the conventional market for energy. Digital innovations help to align supply and demand and help the customer have a care-free experience; data plays a crucial part in all this.

MSc in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) field.
4+ years of experience working as a data scientist within a company.
Knowledge of common data science techniques, NLP techniques and statistical methods.

WE HAVE A LOT TO OFFER

A gross salary between €68,000.00 - €97,000.00 (annual salary including 8% holiday allowance for a full-time contract), depending on knowledge and experience.
A free spendable flex budget of 14% per on top of your monthly salary, for example to buy extra vacation days or have it paid out.
Public transport card, also privately sustainable on the road, with which you also travel for free in your free time throughout the Netherlands.
Parental leave, good pension scheme and career opportunities.
Hybrid working; you will work 40% in the office and 40% at home. The other day you decide where best to work.
Drive data driven decision making to build innovative digital products
