We are always looking for data-minded people we can learn from.


Tasks


About the Job




At Gemma Analytics, we help businesses unlock the power of data to drive smarter decisions. As we expand our capabilities in data science, we’re looking for a (Principal) Data Scientist to take the lead in shaping and scaling this new vertical.




This is a unique opportunity for a pragmatic and business-focused data scientist who thrives in delivering real-world impact rather than research-driven models. You’ll work hands-on with machine learning, advanced analytics, and AI-driven solutions—while also collaborating with clients and stakeholders to align data science initiatives with business goals.




Responsibilities:





Build the Data Science vertical: Define and develop the capabilities, processes, and strategies to establish data science as a key service


Lead end-to-end data science projects – From problem identification to deployment and impact measurement, ensuring models are practical, scalable, and aligned with business needs


Develop and deploy machine learning models – Expertise in supervised and unsupervised ML techniques (e.g., regression, classification, clustering) and their application in areas like demand forecasting, churn prediction, and pricing optimization


Act as a trusted advisor, collaborating with clients to understand their challenges and deliver practical, impactful solutions


Stay hands-on with data engineering & analytics – Work with SQL, Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy), and modern cloud data stacks (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) to prepare and process data for modeling


Keep up with emerging trends and tools in data science, leveraging them to improve client results and refine internal processes


Cultivate a collaborative and innovative team culture, mentoring junior team members as the vertical grows



Requirements


You're not just a Data Scientist—you’re a builder, problem-solver, and strategic thinker who knows how to balance technical sophistication with business impact.




Besides that, we are looking for the following:





5+ years of hands-on experience in Data Science, with a proven track record of leading and delivering real-world business-focused ML projects


An entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to work autonomously to build new initiatives


Pragmatism in delivering solutions that balance technical sophistication with business feasibility


Proficiency in Python, SQL, and data science libraries; experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) is a plus


Experience deploying models in production environments that interact with modern data warehouses and cloud-based ML services


Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to diverse audiences


Optional: Knowledge of data modeling and data engineering concepts to collaborate effectively with technical teams.



Benefits


We are located in Berlin, close to Nordbahnhof. We are currently 19 colleagues and will grow to 22 colleagues this year. Other perks include:





We are a hybrid company that meets in the office twice a week - one common office day and one flexible day


We allow for intra-EU workcations for up to 3 months a year (extra-EU workcations also if this is allowed)


We have an honest, inclusive work environment and want to nurture this environment


We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective


We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles


We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input


We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open to further initiatives


We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees


We are fast-growing and have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably


We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, and having a good time (2021: Austria, 2022: Czech Republic, 2023: Germany, 2024: Germany)

That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Machine Learning Engineer(d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

If you’re looking for a big team, a slow-paced environment, or a job where you can coast along without ownership, this probably isn’t the right fit. We move fast, iterate quickly, and expect everyone to contribute with initiative and creativity.

Requirements


You are based in Berlin or willing to relocate within four weeks of starting.
You thrive in a dynamic startup environment, where fast development cycles and quick deployment are essential.
You have 4+ years of experience in software engineering, data analysis, or software engineering management.
You meet most of the following criteria:
Strong Python skills: You have at least 3-5 years of hands-on coding experience.
Data Visualization & Data Science: You enjoy making complex data understandable and have a solid background in Data Science or Mathematics, especially in working with geospatial data.
Cloud Expertise: You are familiar with AWS architecture and comfortable working with serverless tools (e.g., AWS Lambda, Athena, S3).
Customer-Focused Mindset: You enjoy working closely with customers, helping them get the most out of the product, and explaining technical concepts in an accessible way.
Allrounder: You are fine with switching between roles. Sometimes you are a project manager, sometimes a Data Scientist, sometimes a Backend engineer or QA engineer.

Our proposition to you





We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.


To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.


Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.


Transparent salary and career planning from day one.


A beautiful office in the centre of Kreuzberg, with tons of benefits, such as free drinks, snacks, consoles etc.


28 days of vacation


A shared revenue model - when Kineo does well, you will benefit financially, too





Success in the role means that you will have





After 2 months: You established yourself as a member of the team and have already contributed to one of our client projects. You have a clear understanding of how we work and can independently navigate our technical architecture.


After 6 months: You are a key member of the team and fully involved in the development of a client project. You will have made notable contributions to our codebase and internal processes.


After 12-24 months: In collaboration with internal science and engineering resources, you lead the development of a client-facing application from the workshop phase to production. You are a trusted expert in a wide variety of machine learning algorithms and you are able to transfer that knowledge to more junior members of the team.





Your Character Traits





You want to achieve something and don't need a ""manager"" to tell you that. You are eager to have space to take responsibility and grow from that.


You enjoy exploring beyond your immediate tasks and are open to learning new skills. You collaborate across different areas to help the team succeed, even in areas outside your main expertise.


You are a strong communicator with the ability to present ideas clearly and collaborate effectively. You value building positive relationships and working together to achieve shared goals.





You fit in with our team culture if you





Enjoy working in an environment that combines pragmatic, commercial thinking with a strong desire to learn and grow together. We value team players that are curious but convey humility and respect for different opinions.


You actively choose to work in a start-up, with all the ups and downs.


See open feedback, accountability and independent thinking as the foundation for exceptional (team) work.


You embrace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. You are excited to contribute to an environment where different perspectives are celebrated, and you actively participate in fostering awareness and continuous learning around DEI.



Tasks



You will work as part of smaller teams of 2-3 people on developing machine learning solutions with our clients.


You will conceptualize and implement algorithmic solutions to challenging business problems. This includes prototyping and productionizing of machine learning solutions, and also defining and analysing product use cases together with the customer.


You will own machine learning solutions from the first drop of raw data, all the way into production serving millions of inference requests.



Requirements



An advanced quantitative degree - e.g Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related fields. Strong knowledge of theoretical math and CS.


At least two years of work experience as Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.


Knowledge of working with large structured and unstructured data sets. Knowledge of data engineering tools like Apache Spark is an advantage.


Strong programming skills in Python. We love other languages too, but Python is what we (and you) will use.


We are AI Consultants - ask yourself: Do you want to be a Consultant?


Experience in using a wide range of ML frameworks such as SKLearn, Tensorflow, Torch in production. Experience with domain specific libraries like OpenCV, HuggingFace etc are an advantage.


Good written and verbal communication in both English and German. Most of our clients are German speaking so a level of at least B2 is required for the role.


Resident in Germany. Due to the size of the company, we cannot currently accept applications from other EU/non-EU countries.





We explicitly do not hire anyone who discriminates against people on the basis of religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status or other aspects. We encourage people from LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented groups to apply.




Last but not least, keep in mind that we are hiring value based, not skill based. That being said, please tell us the following in your contact message:

truemetrics helps organizations to navigate the world more efficiently. We are solving one of the biggest pain points in last mile delivery: how to get parcels, groceries, and food to the right door faster and more efficiently.

Our technology sits in the smartphone of the courier and understands where they park and enter a building. Our technology is right now mapping locations in Kasachstan, Qatar, Germany, Switzerland, the UK and many other countries.

Who we are

We are a tech-driven, customer-obsessed company with a small but highly skilled team, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in mapping and positioning.

We thrive on autonomy, ownership, and speed—which means we’re looking for curious problem-solvers who love tackling hard challenges and making an immediate impact. If you want structure, rigid processes, and a slow corporate environment, this is not the place for you.

Why join us?


Real Impact: Solve practical challenges that help thousands of delivery drivers navigate cities more efficiently.
Collaborative Environment: Work closely with a tight-knit team of founders and engineers scaling the company.
Technical Depth: Tackle advanced problems in positioning, sensor fusion, and large-scale data processing.
Industry Shaping: Influence the future of AI-driven mapping technology in a rapidly growing sector.
Global Ambition: Join a startup partnering with top logistics companies like GLS, DPD, and Snoonu.
Dynamic Culture: Experience the fast-paced environment of a Silicon Valley-connected startup. We are backed by some of the most successful investors in the world like Y-Combinator, Soma Capital or Rebel Fund.


Why NOT to join us?

If you’re looking for a big team, a slow-paced environment, or a job where you can coast along without ownership, this probably isn’t the right fit. We move fast, iterate quickly, and expect everyone to contribute with initiative and creativity.

Requirements


You are based in Berlin or willing to relocate within four weeks of starting.
You thrive in a dynamic startup environment, where fast development cycles and quick deployment are essential.
You have 4+ years of experience in software engineering, data analysis, or software engineering management.
You meet most of the following criteria:
Strong Python skills: You have at least 3-5 years of hands-on coding experience.
Data Visualization & Data Science: You enjoy making complex data understandable and have a solid background in Data Science or Mathematics, especially in working with geospatial data.
Cloud Expertise: You are familiar with AWS architecture and comfortable working with serverless tools (e.g., AWS Lambda, Athena, S3).
Customer-Focused Mindset: You enjoy working closely with customers, helping them get the most out of the product, and explaining technical concepts in an accessible way.
Allrounder: You are fine with switching between roles. Sometimes you are a project manager, sometimes a Data Scientist, sometimes a Backend engineer or QA engineer.

Your Role at Truemetrics

Data Exploration, Analysis & Improvement


Analyze and prepare data: By preparing data in a way that is easy to understand, you ensure our customers receive meaningful insights.
Customer Success & Onboarding: You help present our product to customers and continuously improve the early onboarding experience.
Support POCs & Pilot Projects: You help manage proof-of-concept (POC) and pilot projects, ensuring smooth execution and learning opportunities.


Software Engineering


Troubleshooting & Data Quality: If something breaks in our data, you investigate the root cause and propose solutions. If everything burns, you are playing the detective to find out what didn’t went well
Prototyping & Innovation: You design and implement early prototypes for new features and contribute ideas for improving our algorithms and data processing techniques.

Culture and values

We are guided by our shared values. It's not about finding people who think and act in the same way. These values help to guide our work and will continue to strengthen it.

Thoughtful

Thoughtful at Iso is about curiosity, creativity and care. It is about good people doing good, rigorous and future-making science every single day.

Brave

Brave at Iso is about fearlessness, but it’s also about initiative and integrity. The scale of the challenge demands nothing less.

Determined

Determined at Iso is the way we pursue our goal. It’s a confidence in our hypothesis, as well as the urgency and agility needed to deliver on it. Because disease won’t wait, so neither should we.

Together

Together at Iso is about connection, collaboration across fields and catalytic relationships. It’s knowing that transformation is a group project, and remembering that what we’re doing will have a real impact on real people everywhere.

Creating An Inclusive Company

We believe that to be successful we need our teams to reflect and represent the populations we are striving to serve. We’re working to build a supportive and inclusive environment where collaboration is encouraged, learning is shared and every employee feels like they truly belong. We value diversity of experience, knowledge, backgrounds and perspectives, and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact.

We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Hybrid working

It’s hugely important for us to share knowledge and build strong relationships with each other, and we find it easier to do this if we spend time together in person. This is why we follow a hybrid model, and would require you to be able to come into the office 3 days a week (currently Tuesday, Wednesday, and one other day depending on which team you’re in). As an equal opportunities employer, we are committed to building an equal and inclusive team. If you have additional needs that would prevent you from following this hybrid approach, we’d be happy to talk through these if you’re selected for an initial screening call.

Please note that when you submit an application, your data will be processed in line with our privacy policy.

About Us

We’re OakNorth Bank and we embolden entrepreneurs to realise their ambitions, understand their markets, and apply data intelligence to everyday decisions to scale successfully at pace.

Banking should be barrier-free. It’s a belief at our very core, inspired by our entrepreneurial spirit, driven by the unmet financial needs of millions, and delivered by our data-driven tools.

And for those who love helping businesses thrive? Our savings accounts help diversify the high street and create new jobs, all while earning savers some of the highest interest on the market.

But we go beyond finance, to empower our people, encourage professional growth and create an environment where everyone can thrive. We strive to create an inclusive and diverse workplace where people can be themselves and succeed.

Our story

OakNorth Bank was built on the foundations of frustrations with old-school banking. In 2005, when our founders tried to get capital for their data analytics company, the computer said ‘no’. Unfortunately, all major banks in the UK were using the same computer – and it was broken.

Why was it so difficult for a profitable business with impressive cashflow, retained clients, and clear commercial success to get a loan?

The industry was backward-looking and too focused on historic financials, rather than future potential.

So, what if there was a bank, founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs? One that offered a dramatically better borrowing experience for businesses?

No more what ifs, OakNorth Bank exists.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production.

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work.

This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

About BuildOps:

BuildOps is a fast-paced, high-growth start-up committed to transforming a $300B+ industry through an innovative all-in-one SaaS platform. Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking Commercial Specialty Contractors from the world of pen and paper to cloud-based, data-driven operations. Our leadership team has deep experience in both the Construction and SaaS technology industries, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful start-up exits.

BuildOps has more than doubled year-over-year while raising over $140 million in total funding (including a recent round in Feb 2024). Top-tier investors like Founders Fund, Siemens, B Capital Group (BCG's venture arm), 01 Advisors, and more have backed BuildOps! Also, Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, just joined our board, adding to an impressive group of investors/advisors including former President of Salesforce, Gavin Patterson; CAA founder Michael Ovitz; NFL legend Joe Montana; former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

Write test plan specifications for small-sized packet forwarding engine features and system software, and implement automated test programs to execute the cases described in the test plan.
Debug problems found by our automated test programs and fix the problems.
Work on a team implementing, testing, and debugging solutions to larger packet forwarding engine software problems and system software issues.
Work with Customer Support Engineers to analyze problems in customer networks and provide fixes for those problems when needed in the form of new software releases or software patches.
Work with the hardware team and hardware component vendors to bring up initial versions of new systems using packet forwarding engines and system software.
Work with the diagnostic software team to design and develop software for the validation of new packet forwarding engine ASICs and hardware components.
Work with the System Test Engineers to analyze problems found in their tests and provide fixes for those problems.
Mentor new and junior engineers to bring them up to speed in Arista's software development environment.
Review and contribute to the specifications and implementations written by other team members.
Help to create a schedule for the implementation and debugging tasks, updating that schedule weekly, and reporting it to the project lead.


Qualifications


BSc, MS or Ph.D. in Computer Science/Electrical Engineering/Computer Engineering with 2+ years of related post graduate work experience
Experience or knowledge in the following:
C or C++
Knowledge of UNIX or Linux
Understanding of IP networking or distributed systems
Applied understanding of software engineering principles
Strong problem solving and software troubleshooting skills
Ability to design a solution to a small-sized problem, and implement that solution without outside help. Able to work on a small team solving a medium-sized problem with limited oversight.







Additional Information



The new hire base pay for this role has a pay range of $95,000 to $145,000. Arista offers different pay ranges based on work location, so that we can offer consistent and competitive pay appropriate to the market. The actual base pay offered will be based on a wide range of factors, including skills, qualifications, relevant experience, and work location.
