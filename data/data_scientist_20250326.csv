¿Quiénes somos?

Sabadell Zurich es una joint venture que nace en 2008 como fruto del acuerdo empresarial entre Banc Sabadell y Zurich para la gestión del negocio de Bancaseguros.

Está integrada por tres compañías distintas: BanSabadell Vida, BanSabadell Pensiones y BanSabadell Seguros Generales; la propiedad de las cuales está compartida al 50% entre ambos socios.

La plantilla de Sabadell Zurich está formada por alrededor de 300 personas, quienes, a nivel organizacional, se contabilizan como parte de la estructura de Grupo Zurich en España.

It houses MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, was a founding and hosting member of the former European HPC infrastructure PRACE (Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe), and is now hosting entity for EuroHPC JU, the Joint Undertaking that leads large-scale investments and HPC provision in Europe.

The mission of BSC is to research, develop and manage information technologies in order to facilitate scientific progress.

BSC combines HPC service provision and R&D into both computer and computational science (life, earth and engineering sciences) under one roof, and currently has over 1000 staff from 60 countries.

We are particularly interested for this role in the strengths and lived experiences of women and underrepresented groups to help us avoid perpetuating biases and oversights in science and IT research.

In instances of equal merit, the incorporation of the under-represented sex will be favoured.

We promote Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, fostering an environment where each and every one of us is appreciated for who we are, regardless of our differences.

Context And Mission

The Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB) was created in 2003 with the mission to support bioinformatics activities across the country.

Since then, it has evolved to keep up with emerging needs - especially in the field of creating, maintaining and extending technological infrastructures that facilitate research activities in the broad domain of Life Sciences.

Since 2017, the INB is the Spanish Node of ELIXIR (ELIXIR-ES), the pan-European Research Infrastructure for the management of research data and other digital assets in Life Sciences across 22 national members and 3 observers.

Both the INB Technical Coordination Hub and the INB Computational Node, part of the Life Sciences Department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CNS), participate and lead different local, national and international - mainly European - projects related to research data and software management as well as to the set-up of virtual research environments where data and software can be utilised.

As part of the EU-funded ELIXIR-EXCELERATE project, both teams started the development of OpenEBench, the ELIXIR open data platform to support both the technical monitoring of research software - including workflows - and the scientific benchmarking activities led by research communities.

Since its inception, OpenEBench has grown to monitor more than 43,000 individual research software entries and support more than 16 different research communities at different maturation stages, including the participation of different funded projects like EUCanImage, EUCAIM, DataTools4Heart, VEIS among others.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field has experienced accelerated growth over the past years with many applications having a great impact on the general population, including the use of AI/ML models to support decision-making processes in clinical applications.

However, limited efforts have been put to understand and validate AI/ML models in terms of both the data and software used to train and refine them.

Thus, the INB teams are seeking a research software engineer to develop methodologies for carrying out systematic evaluation and validation efforts in the context of OpenEBench and connected with ongoing projects, e.g.

EUCAIM, and others to come.

The objective is to develop strategies and methodologies that can be utilised by the different research communities working with OpenEBench to understand the potential biases present in the input data and limitations of the generated AI/ML models.

Such a generalization should contribute to foster broader discussions among the different communities leading to the iterative refinement process of it.

The funding for these actions/fellowships and contracts comes from the European Union Recovery and Resilience Facility - Next Generation, within the framework of the General Invitation by the public business entity Red.es to participate in the talent attraction and retention programs within Investment 4 of Component 19 of the Recovery, Transformation, and Resilience Plan.

Why join us?

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means ‘more than you’d expect’, and it’s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it’s only fitting that we’d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.

We think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn’t be siloed from the rest of the organisation – they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.

Speaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is ‘champion the customer’, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is ‘succeed as a team’, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also ‘make it happen’ by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we ‘build to scale’, creating lasting solutions that address today’s challenges and anticipate tomorrow’s needs.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices —and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us, we'll help you set up the best remote setup possible and make sure you still have time to connect with your team.

About Your Application


Please submit your application in English; it’s our company language so you’ll be speaking lots of it if you join 💕
We treat all candidates equally: If you are interested please apply through our application system - any correspondence should come from there! Our lovely support isn't able to pass on any calls/ emails our way - and this makes sure that the candidate experience is smooth and fair to everyone 😊
We’re on a mission to make everyone feel valued at work. That’s only achievable if our team reflects the diversity of the world around us - and that starts with you, hitting apply, even if you are worried you might not tick all the boxes! We embrace and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply - regardless of race/ethnicity, colour, religion, nationality, gender, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, neurodiversity, socio-economic status, culture or beliefs

We’re looking for an aspiring AI Engineer [Medior / Senior] who wants to help deliver real world solutions.




Who are we?

We are the DEUS initiative, and we are all about exploring AI in the service of humanity. No, we are not calling ourselves gods(!), but our name is a reference to ‘deus ex machina’ (or god from the machine in Latin). We believe that artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing will have a massive impact on the way we live, and we want to make sure that we create a positive impact on the world with these AI services.

As a happy coincidence, DEUS is also an acronym representing the quadrivium of key disciplines we believe are important to building successful AI-powered services: Data / Engineering / User-experience design / Strategy.

DEUS is a new initiative, but the founders have been working together very successfully for years, so there is a comfortable family feel to the company. We have an amazing set of international client partnerships (and projects/challenges). Our headquarters is located in the heart of the city centre of Amsterdam. We also have a team in Portugal that is based out of the beautiful city of Porto with an office close to the beach, and our Spanish team is based out of the charming center of A Coruña!




Who are you?

You are an experienced AI Engineer with a passion for building scalable, production-ready AI solutions. You have at least 2 to 4 years of experience in developing and deploying AI models and systems. You have hands-on experience with some or all of the following:

Proficiency in working with LLMs and agentic architectures (e.g., LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, Swarm, or similar).
Proficiency in Python and frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar.
Engineering expertise in building AI pipelines, model optimization, and deployment.
Experience with model traceability using LangFuse, LangSmith, or similar.
Cloud computing knowledge (AWS, GCP, Azure) and familiarity with containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
Strong software development best practices, including version control (Git), CI/CD, and testing.
Developing and maintaining AI solutions, such as Natural Language Processing or Computer Vision.
Experience with LLMOps practices, including agents monitoring and lifecycle management.




...and some more points:

Written and verbal English is the only core requirement.
You have experience in stakeholder management from initial brainstorming and requirements elicitation to solution deployment and dev-ops. You should be able to pilot any given AI project, and together with the Data team devise a solution that respect both customer and DEUS.AI interests and ethics.
You take initiative to explore and work on new solutions and approaches together with the stakeholders that might entail problem (re)formulations, proposal of new technologies and development of disruptive solutions.
You are a problem solver who is able to balance the needs and priorities of project stakeholders and teams.
We will provide top hardware [macbook pro etc.] and the latest software – we use the right tools for the job.




Some of the tasks you might be doing:

Work closely with other teams and individuals to plan, coordinate and seek feedback, following Agile methodologies
Implement AI integration layer to deliver multi agent approach
Experiment with latest AI and LLM technologies
Set up and launch new projects from scratch, establishing best practices for scalability and maintainability
Setup and improve CI/CD pipeline
Implement monitoring, logging and alerting
Create unit tests of your code
Work with the business to gather requirements and specifications
Squeeze every last drop of performance out of your backend and websites through benchmarking and optimisation
Use infrastructure tools such as Terraform, Docker, Helm charts




note: If you don’t feel that you perfectly fit the description above, but you have some other background or skillset that you think could be of interest, please still get in touch!




We are dedicated to making a friendly and inclusive workplace. To put it bluntly, there is an unwritten ‘no assholes’ policy that applies to both ourselves and our clients, as we always want to enjoy our team dynamic. We do trips, conferences and events together on a regular basis, and we are always committed to cultivating a company that embraces differences. We strongly believe in flexibility, and you will be given a lot of freedom while translating complicated problems into easy-to-use products. This means managing your own priorities, trying out new things and working a flexible hours’ scheme.




If this all sounds interesting to you, then hit that Apply Now button in the top right corner! We would love to hear from you!

We’re looking for an aspiring AI Engineer [Medior / Senior] who wants to help deliver real world solutions.




Who are we?

We are the DEUS initiative, and we are all about exploring AI in the service of humanity. No, we are not calling ourselves gods(!), but our name is a reference to ‘deus ex machina’ (or god from the machine in Latin). We believe that artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing will have a massive impact on the way we live, and we want to make sure that we create a positive impact on the world with these AI services.

As a happy coincidence, DEUS is also an acronym representing the quadrivium of key disciplines we believe are important to building successful AI-powered services: Data / Engineering / User-experience design / Strategy.

DEUS is a new initiative, but the founders have been working together very successfully for years, so there is a comfortable family feel to the company. We have an amazing set of international client partnerships (and projects/challenges). Our headquarters is located in the heart of the city centre of Amsterdam. We also have a team in Portugal that is based out of the beautiful city of Porto with an office close to the beach, and our Spanish team is based out of the charming center of A Coruña!




Who are you?

You are an experienced AI Engineer with a passion for building scalable, production-ready AI solutions. You have at least 2 to 4 years of experience in developing and deploying AI models and systems. You have hands-on experience with some or all of the following:

Proficiency in working with LLMs and agentic architectures (e.g., LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, Swarm, or similar).
Proficiency in Python and frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar.
Engineering expertise in building AI pipelines, model optimization, and deployment.

You take initiative to explore and work on new solutions and approaches together with the stakeholders that might entail problem (re)formulations, proposal of new technologies and development of disruptive solutions.
