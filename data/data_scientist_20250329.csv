Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $180,000 - $270,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location.

Responsibilities

​Partner with developers, product managers, and business partners to frame problems mathematically and in the right business context
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the problem
Construct and fit statistical, machine learning, or optimization models
Implement advanced analytics techniques to identify key factors impacting the quality and shelf life of fruits
Develop predictive models and machine-learning algorithms to predict the shelf life of different types of fruits
Design experimentation strategies for evaluating our models

The Special Projects team at Microsoft Research Redmond, along with applied science partners in Microsoft’s Experiences & Devices organization, is looking for PhD-level Research Interns to work at the intersection of AI and productivity.

Artificial Intelligence is changing the nature of knowledge work, providing new capabilities that augment how we produce digital goods and services. Research at the intersection of AI and productivity seeks to understand and improve the impact of AI on knowledge work: what is being impacted, in what ways, over what time span, and ultimately how can AI help people generate the most value.

Building this “productivity flywheel” for human-AI collaboration requires methodological innovation to learn from data and translate that learning into advances at all levels of the AI stack, from the model and system level to the application and user interaction. In this quantitative role, the Research Intern will draw on cutting-edge methods from one or more of computer science, computational social science, economics, and data science to help build the next generation of human-AI productivity systems.

Responsibilities

Research Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, Research Interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Research Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, Research Interns are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other Research Interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.

Additionally, AI & Productivity Research Interns will complete a full scientific research project, from project selection through technical work and analysis, and finally drafting a manuscript to submit for publication.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.

Lila Sciences is a privately held, early-stage technology company pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to transform every aspect of the scientific method. Lila Sciences is backed by Flagship Pioneering, which brings the courage, long-term vision, and resources needed to realize unreasonable results. Join our mission-driven team and contribute to the future of science.

We are leveraging AI across both Life Sciences and Physical Sciences to transform the process of invention and discovery,

At Lila Sciences, we are uniquely cross-functional and collaborative. We are actively reimagining the way teams work together and communicate. Therefore, we seek individuals with an inclusive mindset and a diversity of thought. Our teams thrive in unstructured and creative environments. All voices are heard because we know that experience comes in many forms, skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

The Role

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

Candidates should have experience and/or interest in some or all of:


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


Qualifications:


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


Working at Lila, you would have access to advanced technology in the areas of:


AI experimental design and simulation
Automated custom instrumentation
Generative molecular and material design

Our platform, which reinvents expensive and time-consuming accounting processes, is the first step in our vision to unlock the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on manual insurance operations.

Our Series B, announced in early 2025, led by BOND & Workday, comes on the heels of record growth and accelerating expansion plans.

Why you should consider joining


Record-setting growth, having gone from zero to 8-figure ARR within three years of founding, representing 95th+ percentile company growth among startups that achieve these revenue milestones
Strong product market fit revealed in growth and through customer love, with users describing the platform as “the best thing since sliced bread” and ""life-changing""
Our lean, talented team is creating category-defining products for large public and private enterprises, driving 7-figure ROI and cash-flow operations, providing the best of both worlds: outsized employee ownership and low company risk
We're continuing to take big, ambitious first-to-market bets for a highly committed customer base and an exciting pipeline of new customers
We’re in the early innings of our vision and poised to take advantage of the massive opportunity to deploy AI into core workflows throughout the insurance industry


About The Role

We're hiring an Applied Data Scientist to join us onsite in San Francisco. Our product is growing incredibly quickly, generating a massive dataset. But the insurance back office remains mired in manual processes. You'll have the opportunity to capitalize on this by building predictive models and AI-powered tools to transform what's possible for our customers.

Who you are


3+ years experience leveraging data-driven analysis and predictive modeling to drive key business decisions
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases
Contributed to predictive systems in a production environment
Excellent written and verbal communication skills; ability to clearly explain your work and collaborate with stakeholders
Comfortable with handling ambiguity and working in a self-directed manner
Curiosity about different industries and the data + business context within them


Projects you might work on


Leverage the latest models to build agents automating natural language-based workflows
Build a system to orchestrate + optimize the processing of millions of transactions
Analyze the efficacy of a new product launch & recommend + drive product improvements


Our team & philosophy

We’re backed by BOND, Spark Capital, Neo, and Workday, as well as founders/executives from Brex, Asana, Plaid, Applied Intuition, Coalition, and more.

Our team hails from companies like Airbnb, Google, Brex, and LiveRamp and we’re fairly low-profile: focusing the majority of our energy on delivering for customers and building a category-defining company.

We’re hiring predominantly in San Francisco 🌁, as we believe in-person collaboration is strategically important for a company at our stage — both for velocity and company culture.

Benefits


Competitive base salary and generous equity
Generous medical, dental, and vision benefits
401K plan enrollment
Flexible time-off policy
Lunch & dinner every day
Paid parental leave
Company outings and offsites
(and more benefits as we grow!)


Comulate is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture that celebrates authenticity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, protected veteran status, or any other legally protected characteristics.

Compensation Range: $150K - $200K

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Job Description:

We are seeking a Data Scientist/Operations Researcher to design and implement advanced discrete event simulations and develop digital twin capabilities for our supply chain. In this role, you will collaborate with cross-functional teams—including engineering, operations, product management, and other data scientists—to model complex supply chain scenarios, run “what-if” analyses, and translate insights into actionable strategies. While simulation is the primary focus of this position, you will also leverage optimization and operations research methods to enhance our decision-making processes.




Key Responsibilities:

Simulation Model Development
Design, develop, and maintain discrete event simulation models to evaluate and improve supply chain operations.
Build scalable simulation frameworks in Python (e.g., using SimPy or other simulation libraries), with openness to exploring other platforms or tools.
Collaborate with stakeholders to define key performance indicators (KPIs), data requirements, and realistic assumptions in simulation modeling.
Digital Twin Architecture
Lead the development of a digital twin for Sam’s Supply Chain, integrating real-time data feeds and advanced analytics.
Ensure the digital twin can replicate physical processes accurately and provide actionable insights for operational improvements.
Optimization & Operations Research
Apply advanced optimization methods (linear programming, mixed-integer programming, heuristic algorithms, etc.) to support supply chain decision-making.
Work closely with cross-functional teams to identify areas of opportunity for optimization in transportation, inventory, and warehouse operations.

Qualifications




Education & Experience:

Master’s or Ph.D. in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Data Science, or a related field.
3+ years of hands-on experience in building discrete event simulation models and running complex simulation projects.
Demonstrated experience with optimization techniques in a supply chain or related domain.




Technical Skills:

Programming Languages: Proficiency in Python is required; experience with simulation libraries (e.g., SimPy, AnyLogic, Arena, or similar) is highly preferred.
Optimization & OR: Knowledge of linear programming, mixed-integer programming, and heuristic algorithms; familiarity with OR tools (e.g., PuLP, Pyomo, Gurobi, CPLEX) is advantageous.
Data Handling: Strong skills in SQL, data wrangling, and data visualization (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, matplotlib, Plotly).
Cloud & Big Data: Familiarity with cloud platforms (e.g., Azure, AWS) and big data technologies (e.g., Spark, Hadoop) is a plus.
Simulation Best Practices: Experience with model calibration, validation techniques, and scenario-based analysis.

Work closely with our Credit Risk Machine Learning team to improve risk-scoring methodologies and loss forecasting models.
Support pricing and limit-setting strategies through quantitative analysis of risk-adjusted returns.
Design and evaluate tests to policy changes to measure the impact of credit risk strategies on financial performance.


Requirements


Master’s degree or Ph.D. in Statistics, Economics, Finance, Computer Science, or a related quantitative field.
3+ years of experience in credit risk analytics, underwriting strategy, or related data science roles in lending or financial services.
Strong experience with SQL and Python (or R) for data analysis and modeling.
Proficiency in credit risk modeling techniques, including logistic regression, scorecard development, and loss forecasting.
Familiarity with credit bureau data, alternative data sources, and regulatory risk considerations.
Ability to synthesize complex analyses into actionable business insights and communicate findings to stakeholders.
Experience with experimentation and causal inference methodologies.


Bonus Points


Experience working in B2B SaaS or fintech, particularly in a lending environment.
Familiarity with risk-based pricing models and financial modeling techniques.
Experience working with credit decisioning systems and automated underwriting workflows.
Knowledge of regulatory frameworks such as CECL, Basel II/III, or stress testing methodologies.


This role offers a unique opportunity to shape the future of credit risk strategy at Brex while working with a world-class data and risk management team. If you are passionate about using data science to drive better lending decisions, we’d love to hear from you!

Eneco has the ambition to lead the energy transition. We excel in the complete chain from energy producing assets to serving customers. This integrated approach connects all Eneco employees and enables us to fulfil our mission. You can feel it throughout the whole organisation, and it leads to multidisciplinary innovations such as Toon, e-Mobility and our Virtual Power Plant.




You are going to work at a company large enough to effect real change, within a digital department that has the flexibility to rival a start-up. Our organization is open and brimming with energy. At Eneco, anyone with a sharp mind and a positive and active mindset can contribute to a more sustainable world.




Create data driven innovations, services, and products for the whole company.




In Eneco’s digital data science team you will set up data-driven solutions together with other business units. This means you can work on a wide variety of topics on the commercial and the operational side of Eneco, as well as the integration between those two. On the commercial side, this can mean advising customers on sustainable investments based on energy use and building characteristics. On the operational side, improving efficiency of district heating or implementing predictive maintenance for wind turbines can be your next subjects. As an integrated energy company, Eneco is also always looking for innovative solutions to integrate supply and demand. In all these projects, adding value both for the customer and for Eneco is key.




Energy companies have large amounts of data available to work with, and Eneco is a leader in this field, for example from our smart thermostat Toon. The big question is: how will you leverage this data? Distributed energy generation and changes in energy demand have upended the conventional market for energy. Digital innovations help to align supply and demand and help the customer have a care-free experience; data plays a crucial part in all this.

Convey the data science way of working within the organization.
Pragmatic and iterative approach to data science: able to quickly show results to convince the business, rather than wanting to apply the most complex algorithms.




WHAT YOU BRING

You can easily adapt to new environments and situations. You have focus, courage and a “can do” attitude. You use these qualities to obtain the goals that you set for yourself in an ever-changing professional environment.




MSc in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) field.
4+ years of experience working as a data scientist within a company.
Knowledge of common data science techniques, NLP techniques and statistical methods.
Strong oral and written presentation skills in English.
An interest in the energy domain and innovations and a curious mindset.

Fluent in Python and SQL, experience with Azure, MLFlow, AirFlow and Databricks is a plus.




WE HAVE A LOT TO OFFER

A gross salary between €68,000.00 - €97,000.00 (annual salary including 8% holiday allowance for a full-time contract), depending on knowledge and experience.
A free spendable flex budget of 14% per on top of your monthly salary, for example to buy extra vacation days or have it paid out.
Public transport card, also privately sustainable on the road, with which you also travel for free in your free time throughout the Netherlands.
Parental leave, good pension scheme and career opportunities.
Hybrid working; you will work 40% in the office and 40% at home. The other day you decide where best to work.
Drive data driven decision making to build innovative digital products
Help Eneco and its customers become climate neutral by 2035

Analysing results from different commercial actions and drive insights that can lead to optimizing our business.
Reporting the results back to the relevant members of the business, using data visualization tools.
Identifying patterns and trends in data sets, as well as automate these tasks so we can spend less time reviwing normality and more time analyzing interesting anomalous patterns.
Defining new data collection and analysis processes from our different business verticals, such as wealth, insurance, or new countries.
Locate and define new process improvement opportunities.
Ability to identify and automate recurring tasks (through scripts or dashboards).
Create a repository of key queries (really useful queries could be interesting for the rest of the team and for your future work).
Generate documentation of all the processes to facilitate their understanding, transfer or backup.




You have experience on:

Statistical analysis: you know the basic statistical concepts, and know how to implement them in different programming languages (ideally R, Python or Spark). You know when to use different indicators and have experience summarizing data insights with them.
Dealing with large datasets, and implementing scalable solutions. You know what data cleaning means and how to interact with a data engineer.
How to solve problems using data: analyze the problem and decompose it into different analytical components, and recycle all the components you can from other projects.
Software development: you know what git means, and how to develop your own code, test it and use it to produce actionable results. Open-source lovers get a plus if you show us your github!
Data Visualization, and tools like ggplot, matplotlib, tableau, or similar. Bonus points for Microstrategy, or QuickSight.
You are an SQL-ninja, writing simple exploratory or efficient queries won't be a problem for you.

You are confident but not arrogant. You ask for help when you need it. When they don’t know something they just say so. You value and celebrate the contributions of others.
You get things done. You collaboratively create thoughtful plans, communicate them to others, hustle to get resources, and then execute. You are organized. You strongly favor simple and elegant solutions over complex ones.
You don’t freak out when things go wrong. Who wants to work for someone who is constantly in a panic?
You can think at different altitudes. That is, you are equally comfortable dealing with both the big picture and the fine details.
You are superb communicator. You explain your ideas clearly and succinctly. You ask others for input. You listen carefully. You build on the ideas of others. Your presentations are not death by powerpoint.
Transparency is one of your main cards. You enjoy sharing your knowledge.
You are a team player.

Eneco has the ambition to lead the energy transition. We excel in the complete chain from energy producing assets to serving customers. This integrated approach connects all Eneco employees and enables us to fulfil our mission. You can feel it throughout the whole organisation, and it leads to multidisciplinary innovations such as Toon, e-Mobility and our Virtual Power Plant.




You are going to work at a company large enough to effect real change, within a digital department that has the flexibility to rival a start-up. Our organization is open and brimming with energy. At Eneco, anyone with a sharp mind and a positive and active mindset can contribute to a more sustainable world.




Create data driven innovations, services, and products for the whole company.




In Eneco’s digital data science team you will set up data-driven solutions together with other business units. This means you can work on a wide variety of topics on the commercial and the operational side of Eneco, as well as the integration between those two. On the commercial side, this can mean advising customers on sustainable investments based on energy use and building characteristics. On the operational side, improving efficiency of district heating or implementing predictive maintenance for wind turbines can be your next subjects. As an integrated energy company, Eneco is also always looking for innovative solutions to integrate supply and demand. In all these projects, adding value both for the customer and for Eneco is key.




Energy companies have large amounts of data available to work with, and Eneco is a leader in this field, for example from our smart thermostat Toon. The big question is: how will you leverage this data? Distributed energy generation and changes in energy demand have upended the conventional market for energy. Digital innovations help to align supply and demand and help the customer have a care-free experience; data plays a crucial part in all this.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.  Role Overview Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery. Key Responsibilities
Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.
Assist in the conception, development, optimization, and assessment of machine-learning models for understanding the T-cell receptor-peptide-MHC interface.
Work alongside computer science engineers, wet-lab scientists, and project managers, contributing to early discovery, lead identification, lead optimization, and biomarker development.
Maintain familiarity with scientific literature to assist in the development and benchmarking of new methods.
Communicate findings both internally and externally via presentations and publication.
  Qualifications/Experience
PhD in computational biology, machine learning, engineering, statistics, biostatistics, biomedical engineering, cancer biology, immunology, genetics or related field, or Master’s with 3+ years experience, and a strong academic record.
Demonstrated impact in multi-disciplinary, team-driven scientific projects.

Expertise in analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets using scientific and computational best practices to make novel scientific discoveries.
Strong publication record.
Scientific curiosity and interest in working in a dynamic, rapidly developing field.
Background in immunology/immuno-oncology and experience working with single-cell sequencing data is a plus.
 Repertoire is committed towards social responsibility and developing an inclusive culture.  Much as the power of the immune system lies in the diversity of T and B cells, we believe that our work requires the creativity and ingenuity of a diverse workforce, and we are committed to pursuing that in all facets of the work experience at Repertoire.  We will continue to educate ourselves about the inequities and barriers present in our society and act as a company where we can make a difference. Repertoire is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.Recruitment & Staffing Agencies: Repertoire Immune Medicines (“Repertoire”) does not accept unsolicited resumes from any source other than candidates. The submission of unsolicited resumes by recruitment or staffing agencies to Repertoire or its employees is strictly prohibited unless contacted directly by Repertoire’s internal Human Resources team.

Come join a winning team! Here at Imprivata, you’ll see a dedicated group of professionals who care about improving healthcare. Our team thrives on collaboration and sharing ideas, whether in a cross-functional meeting or at one of our virtual team-building events.

While we're diverse in our backgrounds and skills, we have much in common. A passion for our mission. A strong sense of integrity. A belief that we're making a positive impact and a commitment to having fun.

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our team. This is a hybrid opportunity based out of our Waltham, MA; Austin, TX; or St. Petersburg, FL office. We are also extending this as a remote opportunity to candidates located in the Chicago, IL metropolitan area.

Job Summary

The Data Science team is responsible for building out the machine learning capabilities of Imprivata's Digital Identity Platform, with specific projects ranging from detecting patient privacy violations to using machine learning to empower what would be otherwise manual workflows. As a Data Scientist, you'll be deeply involved in every aspect of the project lifecycle, including gathering requirements, cleaning and exploring datasets, running machine learning experiments, and deploying services to production.

Duties And Responsibilities

As a Data Scientist, you'll be expected to:


Put ethics and security first. The datasets that we use almost invariably contain PHI or similarly sensitive information, and we take the responsibility that comes with that access seriously.
Drive business value with machine learning. That includes everything from initial framing of the problem, to pulling and working with data, to training models, to communicating results.
Write high quality, production Python code. While we work closely with other engineering teams, we don't hand off research code to be productionized by someone else -- we own our solutions end-to-end and do our best to keep raising the technical bar.
Build a breadth of machine learning knowledge. Beyond actually training models, you'll rely on that fluency when it comes to tasks like gathering requirements or iterating on model output with subject matter experts.
Communicate effectively. Taking your project from business problem to production service isn't a solo exercise; you'll need to work well with people from other teams and our own in order to succeed.
Collaborate with the team. Everyone is responsible for making the team better through collaboration: as a Data Scientist, you'll work with senior-level members of the team in an informal mentorship role by way of things like pair programming. You'll also be expected to providing meaningful code reviews for others on the team.


Qualifications


Excellent problem solving skills.
Solid experience with Python and common Data Science packages, such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Additional experience with relevant packages such as PyTorch, Dask, Pydantic a plus.
Good understanding of standard machine learning techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction. Additional expertise in specific areas such as NLP, anomaly detection, graph methods, etc. a plus.
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases.
Experience working in a Unix environment.
1-3 years of data science experience.


This position offers a total compensation range of $118,800.00 - $128,800.00 (inclusive of base salary and variable compensation, such as bonuses and incentives). In addition, more information about Imprivata’s benefit offerings can be found here. This range represents the high and low end of Imprivata’s compensation range for this position. Actual compensation will vary and may be above or below the range based on various factors, such as a candidate’s location, skills, experience, and qualifications.

At Imprivata, we have a top-notch work environment, developmental opportunities, a competitive total rewards package, and the desire to have fun. If you have the skills and qualifications as we have described above, we want to hear from you!

Imprivata provides equal employment opportunities, regardless of race, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.

About CloudZero

Cloud cost management is one of the biggest challenges organizations face today. As cloud adoption accelerates, so do the complexities and associated costs - and macroeconomic conditions only increase pressure to prove cloud efficiency. That’s why we built CloudZero: a SaaS platform at the intersection of next-generation cloud cost management and FinOps. CloudZero ingests billing and usage data from all cloud, SaaS, and PaaS providers, organizes it in real-time according to our customers’ business structures, lets customers view it at any level of time or resource granularity, and ultimately empowers them to make more informed business decisions.

Since our founding in 2016, our mission has been to make efficient innovation a reality for every cloud-driven organization. At CloudZero, we believe every engineering decision is a buying decision, yet the cost conversation often bypasses the engineers who drive those determinations. To solve this, we’ve built a dynamic, single-page application that answers the complex, data-heavy questions every cloud-based organization needs to ask if they want to grow their company profitably.

To date, we’ve raised over from leading venture capital firms nationwide. We’re solving problems of massive scale, business importance, and complexity in a space that needs it more than ever. We’re growing rapidly and would love for you to be a part of it.

Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the United States. We cannot currently sponsor or take over the sponsorship of an Employment Visa.

Benefits

CloudZero offers competitive compensation and benefits, including:


Comprehensive Health Care, Dental, and Vision Plans
CloudZero Equity
401(k) Retirement Plan

Formation Bio is a tech and AI driven pharma company differentiated by radically more efficient drug development.

Advancements in AI and drug discovery are creating more candidate drugs than the industry can progress because of the high cost and time of clinical trials. Recognizing that this development bottleneck may ultimately limit the number of new medicines that can reach patients, Formation Bio, founded in 2016 as TrialSpark Inc., has built technology platforms, processes, and capabilities to accelerate all aspects of drug development and clinical trials. Formation Bio partners, acquires, or in-licenses drugs from pharma companies, research organizations, and biotechs to develop programs past clinical proof of concept and beyond, ultimately helping to bring new medicines to patients. The company is backed by investors across pharma and tech, including a16z, Sequoia, Sanofi, Thrive Capital, Sam Altman, John Doerr, Spark Capital, SV Angel Growth, and others.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.  Role Overview Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery. Key Responsibilities
Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.
Assist in the conception, development, optimization, and assessment of machine-learning models for understanding the T-cell receptor-peptide-MHC interface.
Work alongside computer science engineers, wet-lab scientists, and project managers, contributing to early discovery, lead identification, lead optimization, and biomarker development.
Maintain familiarity with scientific literature to assist in the development and benchmarking of new methods.
Communicate findings both internally and externally via presentations and publication.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

About CloudZero

Cloud cost management is one of the biggest challenges organizations face today. As cloud adoption accelerates, so do the complexities and associated costs - and macroeconomic conditions only increase pressure to prove cloud efficiency. That’s why we built CloudZero: a SaaS platform at the intersection of next-generation cloud cost management and FinOps. CloudZero ingests billing and usage data from all cloud, SaaS, and PaaS providers, organizes it in real-time according to our customers’ business structures, lets customers view it at any level of time or resource granularity, and ultimately empowers them to make more informed business decisions.

Since our founding in 2016, our mission has been to make efficient innovation a reality for every cloud-driven organization. At CloudZero, we believe every engineering decision is a buying decision, yet the cost conversation often bypasses the engineers who drive those determinations. To solve this, we’ve built a dynamic, single-page application that answers the complex, data-heavy questions every cloud-based organization needs to ask if they want to grow their company profitably.

To date, we’ve raised over from leading venture capital firms nationwide. We’re solving problems of massive scale, business importance, and complexity in a space that needs it more than ever. We’re growing rapidly and would love for you to be a part of it.

Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the United States. We cannot currently sponsor or take over the sponsorship of an Employment Visa.

Benefits

CloudZero offers competitive compensation and benefits, including:


Comprehensive Health Care, Dental, and Vision Plans
