More than 40% of all fresh produce is wasted in the US, which accounts for over 17 billion dollars in lost product annually and contributes more carbon dioxide emissions than all of US transportation combined. Globally, food that is never consumed accounts for 7% of the global freshwater supply and 308MM hectares of land. Our goal is to reduce these drastic numbers by making the produce supply chain smarter through data-driven decisions.




Strella uses proprietary sensors to predict shelf life in the food supply chain. We use this information to reduce food waste and help deliver better quality produce to consumers. We have been commercialized for 5 years and are currently in our growth stage.




Role

We are looking for an ambitious data scientist with 3+ years of experience to help us build the next generation of our modeling and prediction engine. The applicant must have a strong focus on delivering action-based results that can help customers make better decisions using data. Experience in agriculture is a plus. 




As a startup, we seek applicants who are self-starters and can wear multiple hats. We are in a rapid growth stage and are looking for people who thrive in a fast-paced environment while maintaining quality. This is an in-person role in either our Seattle or Wenatchee WA office.




Responsibilities

​Partner with developers, product managers, and business partners to frame problems mathematically and in the right business context
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the problem
Construct and fit statistical, machine learning, or optimization models
Implement advanced analytics techniques to identify key factors impacting the quality and shelf life of fruits
Develop predictive models and machine-learning algorithms to predict the shelf life of different types of fruits
Design experimentation strategies for evaluating our models
Collaborate with developers to implement algorithms in production
Analyze experimental and observational data; communicate findings; facilitate launch decisions




Skills




Bachelors, M.S. or Ph.D. in Machine Learning, Statistics, Operations Research, Optimization, Computer Science, or other quantitative fields or related work experience
3+ years of professional experience, startup experience required
Proficiency in causal inference, experimentation, signal processing, and/or machine learning

Optimize AI execution on cloud-native infrastructure (AWS, ECS, distributed processing frameworks).




Qualifications




Must-Haves:

• Experience building agentic AI systems—LLMs that autonomously plan, retrieve, and execute actions.

• Proven experience scaling AI infrastructure, including orchestration of models, vector databases, and inference pipelines.

• Strong engineering skills in TypeScript, Node.js, and Python, with an ability to ship production-grade AI applications.

• Experience deploying and fine-tuning LLMs, transformers, or multi-modal models.

• Deep problem-solving skills with a passion for building AI-driven products that solve real-world problems.




Nice-to-Haves:

• Experience with OCR, NLP, or document intelligence in production systems.

• Familiarity with LLM deployment best practices, fine-tuning techniques, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

• DevOps and MLOps experience, including infrastructure-as-code (AWS CDK, Terraform), container orchestration (Kubernetes, ECS), and GPU optimization.

• Background in healthcare, legal tech, or regulatory-heavy industries.




What We Offer

An opportunity to make a direct impact in a fast-growing startup.
A collaborative, entrepreneurial environment working alongside passionate builders.
Competitive salary, equity, and benefits.

We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at DoorDash. We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply.

Data at Brex

Our Scientists and Engineers work together to make data—and insights derived from data—a core asset across Brex. But it's more than just crunching numbers. The Data team at Brex develops infrastructure, statistical models, and products using data. Our work is ingrained in Brex's decision-making process, the efficiency of our operations, our risk management policies, and the unparalleled experience we provide our customers.

What You’ll Do

Your work will directly support our Chief Risk Officer in executing a targeted loss rate while ensuring sustainable growth for our credit offerings. You will leverage data science techniques to enhance our credit risk assessment, optimize lending decisions, and refine our risk-based pricing models. Your insights will play a critical role in aligning risk management with business strategy and regulatory considerations.

The ideal candidate has experience in credit risk modeling, underwriting analytics, and quantitative risk assessment. They should have strong business acumen, deep familiarity with credit products, and the ability to communicate technical insights to non-technical stakeholders.

Where you’ll work

This role will be based in our New York office. You must be willing to work in office at least 2 days per week on Wednesday and Thursday. Employees will be able to work remotely for up to 4 weeks per year.

Responsibilities


Develop analytical frameworks and risk models to inform underwriting decisions and credit policy optimization.
Analyze loss rate trends, credit performance, and portfolio risk dynamics to drive strategy adjustments.
Collaborate with Credit and Enterprise Risk teams to establish data-driven risk appetite frameworks and lending criteria.
Work closely with our Credit Risk Machine Learning team to improve risk-scoring methodologies and loss forecasting models.
Support pricing and limit-setting strategies through quantitative analysis of risk-adjusted returns.
Design and evaluate tests to policy changes to measure the impact of credit risk strategies on financial performance.


Requirements


Master’s degree or Ph.D. in Statistics, Economics, Finance, Computer Science, or a related quantitative field.
3+ years of experience in credit risk analytics, underwriting strategy, or related data science roles in lending or financial services.
Strong experience with SQL and Python (or R) for data analysis and modeling.
Proficiency in credit risk modeling techniques, including logistic regression, scorecard development, and loss forecasting.
Familiarity with credit bureau data, alternative data sources, and regulatory risk considerations.
Ability to synthesize complex analyses into actionable business insights and communicate findings to stakeholders.
Experience with experimentation and causal inference methodologies.


Bonus Points


Experience working in B2B SaaS or fintech, particularly in a lending environment.
Familiarity with risk-based pricing models and financial modeling techniques.
Experience working with credit decisioning systems and automated underwriting workflows.
Knowledge of regulatory frameworks such as CECL, Basel II/III, or stress testing methodologies.


This role offers a unique opportunity to shape the future of credit risk strategy at Brex while working with a world-class data and risk management team. If you are passionate about using data science to drive better lending decisions, we’d love to hear from you!

Compensation

The expected salary range for this role is $152,000 - $190,000.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements

Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $180,000 - $270,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

The Roku Culture

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Knowing what, where, and how to build infrastructure like solar farms is one of the great opportunities of our time. However, there are problems!

The Problem

80% of clean energy projects that developers start never actually get built because most projects are started without deep due diligence on zoning and interconnection due to the cost of collecting that data. This means $17B worth of canceled projects per year.

Our Solution

Paces is software for green infrastructure developers to identify the best places to build and manage their projects. First we collect environmental, permitting, zoning, energy grid data from various different sources; then we analyze the data and use AI to identify the best places for developers to build their next projects.

Eneco has the ambition to lead the energy transition. We excel in the complete chain from energy producing assets to serving customers. This integrated approach connects all Eneco employees and enables us to fulfil our mission. You can feel it throughout the whole organisation, and it leads to multidisciplinary innovations such as Toon, e-Mobility and our Virtual Power Plant.




You are going to work at a company large enough to effect real change, within a digital department that has the flexibility to rival a start-up. Our organization is open and brimming with energy. At Eneco, anyone with a sharp mind and a positive and active mindset can contribute to a more sustainable world.




Create data driven innovations, services, and products for the whole company.




In Eneco’s digital data science team you will set up data-driven solutions together with other business units. This means you can work on a wide variety of topics on the commercial and the operational side of Eneco, as well as the integration between those two. On the commercial side, this can mean advising customers on sustainable investments based on energy use and building characteristics. On the operational side, improving efficiency of district heating or implementing predictive maintenance for wind turbines can be your next subjects. As an integrated energy company, Eneco is also always looking for innovative solutions to integrate supply and demand. In all these projects, adding value both for the customer and for Eneco is key.




Energy companies have large amounts of data available to work with, and Eneco is a leader in this field, for example from our smart thermostat Toon. The big question is: how will you leverage this data? Distributed energy generation and changes in energy demand have upended the conventional market for energy. Digital innovations help to align supply and demand and help the customer have a care-free experience; data plays a crucial part in all this.

Interact with business stakeholders, data analysts, machine learning and data engineers to balance commercial requirements with engineering best practices.
Convey the data science way of working within the organization.
Pragmatic and iterative approach to data science: able to quickly show results to convince the business, rather than wanting to apply the most complex algorithms.




WHAT YOU BRING

You can easily adapt to new environments and situations. You have focus, courage and a “can do” attitude. You use these qualities to obtain the goals that you set for yourself in an ever-changing professional environment.




MSc in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) field.
4+ years of experience working as a data scientist within a company.
Knowledge of common data science techniques, NLP techniques and statistical methods.
Strong oral and written presentation skills in English.
An interest in the energy domain and innovations and a curious mindset.

WE HAVE A LOT TO OFFER

A gross salary between €68,000.00 - €97,000.00 (annual salary including 8% holiday allowance for a full-time contract), depending on knowledge and experience.
A free spendable flex budget of 14% per on top of your monthly salary, for example to buy extra vacation days or have it paid out.
Public transport card, also privately sustainable on the road, with which you also travel for free in your free time throughout the Netherlands.
Parental leave, good pension scheme and career opportunities.
Hybrid working; you will work 40% in the office and 40% at home. The other day you decide where best to work.

Descartes was born out of the conviction that the ever-increasing complexity of risks faced by corporations, governments and vulnerable communities calls for a renewed approach in insurance.

Our team brings together industry veterans from the most renowned institutions (AXA, SCOR, Swiss Re, Marsh, Aon, ...) and scientists on top of their field to bring underwriting excellence. After 6 years of existence, Descartes has secured a leading position in parametric insurance for weather and climate-related risks utilizing machine learning, real-time monitoring from satellite imagery & IoT.

After a successful Series B raise of $120M USD, we launched Descartes Insurance, a 'full stack' insurer licensed to underwrite risk by the French regulator ACPR. With a growing corporate client base (400+ and counting), our diverse team is headquartered in Paris and operates out of our 17 global offices in North America, Europe, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. Descartes is trusted by a panel of A-rated (re)insurers to carry out its activities.

Eneco has the ambition to lead the energy transition. We excel in the complete chain from energy producing assets to serving customers. This integrated approach connects all Eneco employees and enables us to fulfil our mission. You can feel it throughout the whole organisation, and it leads to multidisciplinary innovations such as Toon, e-Mobility and our Virtual Power Plant.




You are going to work at a company large enough to effect real change, within a digital department that has the flexibility to rival a start-up. Our organization is open and brimming with energy. At Eneco, anyone with a sharp mind and a positive and active mindset can contribute to a more sustainable world.




Create data driven innovations, services, and products for the whole company.




In Eneco’s digital data science team you will set up data-driven solutions together with other business units. This means you can work on a wide variety of topics on the commercial and the operational side of Eneco, as well as the integration between those two. On the commercial side, this can mean advising customers on sustainable investments based on energy use and building characteristics. On the operational side, improving efficiency of district heating or implementing predictive maintenance for wind turbines can be your next subjects. As an integrated energy company, Eneco is also always looking for innovative solutions to integrate supply and demand. In all these projects, adding value both for the customer and for Eneco is key.




Energy companies have large amounts of data available to work with, and Eneco is a leader in this field, for example from our smart thermostat Toon. The big question is: how will you leverage this data? Distributed energy generation and changes in energy demand have upended the conventional market for energy. Digital innovations help to align supply and demand and help the customer have a care-free experience; data plays a crucial part in all this.

Convey the data science way of working within the organization.
Pragmatic and iterative approach to data science: able to quickly show results to convince the business, rather than wanting to apply the most complex algorithms.




WHAT YOU BRING

You can easily adapt to new environments and situations. You have focus, courage and a “can do” attitude. You use these qualities to obtain the goals that you set for yourself in an ever-changing professional environment.




MSc in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) field.
4+ years of experience working as a data scientist within a company.
Knowledge of common data science techniques, NLP techniques and statistical methods.
Strong oral and written presentation skills in English.
An interest in the energy domain and innovations and a curious mindset.

WE HAVE A LOT TO OFFER

A gross salary between €68,000.00 - €97,000.00 (annual salary including 8% holiday allowance for a full-time contract), depending on knowledge and experience.
A free spendable flex budget of 14% per on top of your monthly salary, for example to buy extra vacation days or have it paid out.
Public transport card, also privately sustainable on the road, with which you also travel for free in your free time throughout the Netherlands.
Parental leave, good pension scheme and career opportunities.
Hybrid working; you will work 40% in the office and 40% at home. The other day you decide where best to work.
Drive data driven decision making to build innovative digital products

Formation Bio is a tech and AI driven pharma company differentiated by radically more efficient drug development.

Advancements in AI and drug discovery are creating more candidate drugs than the industry can progress because of the high cost and time of clinical trials. Recognizing that this development bottleneck may ultimately limit the number of new medicines that can reach patients, Formation Bio, founded in 2016 as TrialSpark Inc., has built technology platforms, processes, and capabilities to accelerate all aspects of drug development and clinical trials. Formation Bio partners, acquires, or in-licenses drugs from pharma companies, research organizations, and biotechs to develop programs past clinical proof of concept and beyond, ultimately helping to bring new medicines to patients. The company is backed by investors across pharma and tech, including a16z, Sequoia, Sanofi, Thrive Capital, Sam Altman, John Doerr, Spark Capital, SV Angel Growth, and others.

Come join a winning team! Here at Imprivata, you’ll see a dedicated group of professionals who care about improving healthcare. Our team thrives on collaboration and sharing ideas, whether in a cross-functional meeting or at one of our virtual team-building events.

While we're diverse in our backgrounds and skills, we have much in common. A passion for our mission. A strong sense of integrity. A belief that we're making a positive impact and a commitment to having fun.

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our team. This is a hybrid opportunity based out of our Waltham, MA; Austin, TX; or St. Petersburg, FL office. We are also extending this as a remote opportunity to candidates located in the Chicago, IL metropolitan area.

Job Summary

The Data Science team is responsible for building out the machine learning capabilities of Imprivata's Digital Identity Platform, with specific projects ranging from detecting patient privacy violations to using machine learning to empower what would be otherwise manual workflows. As a Data Scientist, you'll be deeply involved in every aspect of the project lifecycle, including gathering requirements, cleaning and exploring datasets, running machine learning experiments, and deploying services to production.

Duties And Responsibilities

As a Data Scientist, you'll be expected to:


Put ethics and security first. The datasets that we use almost invariably contain PHI or similarly sensitive information, and we take the responsibility that comes with that access seriously.
Drive business value with machine learning. That includes everything from initial framing of the problem, to pulling and working with data, to training models, to communicating results.
Write high quality, production Python code. While we work closely with other engineering teams, we don't hand off research code to be productionized by someone else -- we own our solutions end-to-end and do our best to keep raising the technical bar.
Build a breadth of machine learning knowledge. Beyond actually training models, you'll rely on that fluency when it comes to tasks like gathering requirements or iterating on model output with subject matter experts.
Communicate effectively. Taking your project from business problem to production service isn't a solo exercise; you'll need to work well with people from other teams and our own in order to succeed.
Collaborate with the team. Everyone is responsible for making the team better through collaboration: as a Data Scientist, you'll work with senior-level members of the team in an informal mentorship role by way of things like pair programming. You'll also be expected to providing meaningful code reviews for others on the team.


Qualifications


Excellent problem solving skills.
Solid experience with Python and common Data Science packages, such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Additional experience with relevant packages such as PyTorch, Dask, Pydantic a plus.
Good understanding of standard machine learning techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction. Additional expertise in specific areas such as NLP, anomaly detection, graph methods, etc. a plus.
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases.
Experience working in a Unix environment.
1-3 years of data science experience.


This position offers a total compensation range of $118,800.00 - $128,800.00 (inclusive of base salary and variable compensation, such as bonuses and incentives). In addition, more information about Imprivata’s benefit offerings can be found here. This range represents the high and low end of Imprivata’s compensation range for this position. Actual compensation will vary and may be above or below the range based on various factors, such as a candidate’s location, skills, experience, and qualifications.

At Imprivata, we have a top-notch work environment, developmental opportunities, a competitive total rewards package, and the desire to have fun. If you have the skills and qualifications as we have described above, we want to hear from you!

Imprivata provides equal employment opportunities, regardless of race, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.  Role Overview Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery. Key Responsibilities
Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.
Assist in the conception, development, optimization, and assessment of machine-learning models for understanding the T-cell receptor-peptide-MHC interface.
Work alongside computer science engineers, wet-lab scientists, and project managers, contributing to early discovery, lead identification, lead optimization, and biomarker development.
Maintain familiarity with scientific literature to assist in the development and benchmarking of new methods.
Communicate findings both internally and externally via presentations and publication.
  Qualifications/Experience
PhD in computational biology, machine learning, engineering, statistics, biostatistics, biomedical engineering, cancer biology, immunology, genetics or related field, or Master’s with 3+ years experience, and a strong academic record.
Demonstrated impact in multi-disciplinary, team-driven scientific projects.

Expertise in analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets using scientific and computational best practices to make novel scientific discoveries.
Strong publication record.
Scientific curiosity and interest in working in a dynamic, rapidly developing field.
Background in immunology/immuno-oncology and experience working with single-cell sequencing data is a plus.
 Repertoire is committed towards social responsibility and developing an inclusive culture.  Much as the power of the immune system lies in the diversity of T and B cells, we believe that our work requires the creativity and ingenuity of a diverse workforce, and we are committed to pursuing that in all facets of the work experience at Repertoire.  We will continue to educate ourselves about the inequities and barriers present in our society and act as a company where we can make a difference. Repertoire is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.Recruitment & Staffing Agencies: Repertoire Immune Medicines (“Repertoire”) does not accept unsolicited resumes from any source other than candidates. The submission of unsolicited resumes by recruitment or staffing agencies to Repertoire or its employees is strictly prohibited unless contacted directly by Repertoire’s internal Human Resources team.

Come join a winning team! Here at Imprivata, you’ll see a dedicated group of professionals who care about improving healthcare. Our team thrives on collaboration and sharing ideas, whether in a cross-functional meeting or at one of our virtual team-building events.

While we're diverse in our backgrounds and skills, we have much in common. A passion for our mission. A strong sense of integrity. A belief that we're making a positive impact and a commitment to having fun.

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our team. This is a hybrid opportunity based out of our Waltham, MA; Austin, TX; or St. Petersburg, FL office. We are also extending this as a remote opportunity to candidates located in the Chicago, IL metropolitan area.

Job Summary

The Data Science team is responsible for building out the machine learning capabilities of Imprivata's Digital Identity Platform, with specific projects ranging from detecting patient privacy violations to using machine learning to empower what would be otherwise manual workflows. As a Data Scientist, you'll be deeply involved in every aspect of the project lifecycle, including gathering requirements, cleaning and exploring datasets, running machine learning experiments, and deploying services to production.

Duties And Responsibilities

As a Data Scientist, you'll be expected to:


Put ethics and security first. The datasets that we use almost invariably contain PHI or similarly sensitive information, and we take the responsibility that comes with that access seriously.
Drive business value with machine learning. That includes everything from initial framing of the problem, to pulling and working with data, to training models, to communicating results.
Write high quality, production Python code. While we work closely with other engineering teams, we don't hand off research code to be productionized by someone else -- we own our solutions end-to-end and do our best to keep raising the technical bar.
Build a breadth of machine learning knowledge. Beyond actually training models, you'll rely on that fluency when it comes to tasks like gathering requirements or iterating on model output with subject matter experts.
Communicate effectively. Taking your project from business problem to production service isn't a solo exercise; you'll need to work well with people from other teams and our own in order to succeed.
Collaborate with the team. Everyone is responsible for making the team better through collaboration: as a Data Scientist, you'll work with senior-level members of the team in an informal mentorship role by way of things like pair programming. You'll also be expected to providing meaningful code reviews for others on the team.


Qualifications


Excellent problem solving skills.
Solid experience with Python and common Data Science packages, such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Additional experience with relevant packages such as PyTorch, Dask, Pydantic a plus.
Good understanding of standard machine learning techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction. Additional expertise in specific areas such as NLP, anomaly detection, graph methods, etc. a plus.
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases.
Experience working in a Unix environment.
1-3 years of data science experience.


This position offers a total compensation range of $118,800.00 - $128,800.00 (inclusive of base salary and variable compensation, such as bonuses and incentives). In addition, more information about Imprivata’s benefit offerings can be found here. This range represents the high and low end of Imprivata’s compensation range for this position. Actual compensation will vary and may be above or below the range based on various factors, such as a candidate’s location, skills, experience, and qualifications.

At Imprivata, we have a top-notch work environment, developmental opportunities, a competitive total rewards package, and the desire to have fun. If you have the skills and qualifications as we have described above, we want to hear from you!

Imprivata provides equal employment opportunities, regardless of race, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.
