We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Machine Learning Engineer(d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Why we’re hiring for this role

Montamo is on a mission to revolutionize craftsmanship and solve the skilled labor shortage by building the most efficient installation process on the market. We’ve mastered operations through smart processes and software, and our platform, ""Lubo,"" is already transforming how heat pumps are installed and how tradespeople are trained.

But we’re just getting started. To take our operations, academy, and product to the next level, we need an Analytics Engineer who can build and own Montamo’s data stack from scratch. This role will be pivotal in enabling both in-product analytics for our groundbreaking guided installation platform and internal analytics to drive smarter business decisions across operations, talent development, and customer acquisition.

If you’re excited about shaping the data infrastructure of a fast-growing startup that’s redefining craftsmanship—and want to be part of the next big thing in clean energy solutions—this is your chance.

Work with product to embed actionable insights directly into the technician experience
Internal analytics for business intelligence
Build leadership dashboards tracking KPIs across operations, academy, and customer acquisition
Transform raw operational data into insights that drive smarter decision-making
Enable data-driven optimization of technician scheduling and supply chain
Scale with pragmatism
Implement lightweight solutions that deliver immediate value while supporting future growth
Continuously evolve our data architecture as Montamo expands into new regions and services

Our developing tech stack & practices

While our AI/data stack is just getting started, you’ll have the freedom to shape it using modern tools:


Data pipeline tools: Airflow or dbt (or your preferred choice!)
Data storage: Postgres (for now), Snowflake or BigQuery (as we scale)
Analytics tools: Looker Studio for dashboards; Python/R for deeper analysis
Event tracking: TBD—you’ll help us decide!


We love pragmatic approaches that focus on delivering value fast without compromising quality. You’ll work closely with our software engineering team building Lubo on Next.js/Node.js/Postgres.

Dein Profil

You’re Our Match If You


Have 2-4 years of experience shipping AI systems and can navigate full-stack development
Get excited about:
Edge cases of deploying vision models on construction sites
Optimizing RAG pipelines for non-English speakers

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

As a Berlin-based AgriTech start-up, we’re empowering farmers to restore soil, boost biodiversity, and capture carbon—all while earning revenue through our platform.

Backed by $22 million in Series A funding, we’re expanding globally, partnering with major food industry leaders like Nestlé and Kaufland to help them reduce emissions along their supply chains, while making them more resilient and profitable at the same time. Since 2020, we’ve supported 3,500 farmers, covering 700,000 hectares (5% of Germany’s farmland!).

If you’re passionate about building a sustainable food system and driving real climate impact, join us and help create a healthier planet!

Your mission:

At Klim, we've pioneered the world’s first digital platform for regenerative agriculture, empowering thousands of farmers to champion sustainable practices. We provide financial compensation to farmers for their regenerative practices and offer high-quality advisory services.

Now, we're looking for a Data Scientist to join our dynamic team. In this role, you'll have the opportunity to be at the forefront of change, helping develop sophisticated data products to aid farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture.

Backed by visionary investors like Atlantic Food Labs, Ananda Impact Ventures, and AgFunder, we're on a trajectory of growth and innovation. If you're ready to make a difference and be part of something truly meaningful, join us at Klim, and together, let's cultivate a brighter tomorrow for all.

Ability to translate business requirements into quantitative solutions and clearly communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders.
Ability to manage multiple projects in a fast-paced environment.
Experience working with large-scale geospatial and sensor data and familiarity with remote sensing a plus.
Full working proficiency in English. German is a plus.


Benefits:


Opportunity: Be part of our journey from the very beginning, working on an equal footing with the leadership team to build a new company.
Impact: Make a daily and active contribution to combating climate change, promoting consumer education, and fostering fair conditions for our climate-conscious farmers.
Autonomy: Take ownership of your projects and enjoy a high degree of creative freedom.
Competitive package: Receive a competitive salary and have the opportunity to participate in our VSIP program.
Flexible work model: At Klim, we foster a flexible, hybrid work approach and facilitate hybrid/remote work (within Germany). It is advantageous for this role if you live in Berlin or can be present in our office regularly.
Additional benefits: We offer membership in the Urban Sports Club or the Deutschlandticket, team lunches (if in Berlin) and regular team events.


At Klim, we believe that a thriving workplace is built on the diverse backgrounds, talents, and perspectives of our team. We grow stronger together by embracing and building on each individual’s unique strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. All hiring and personnel decisions are made solely based on qualifications, performance, and the needs of the company—ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for all.

If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply. You might be the perfect fit for our team in ways you don’t yet realise!

About Us

Right now, 25% of CO2 emissions in Europe are caused by heating our buildings. In order for this to be reduced, the transition towards renewable energy needs to be simplified and made more accessible. There are too few installers to meet the growing demand for heat pumps, and a solution to match this trend needs to be brought to the market.

autarc is developing the leading operating system (OS) for heat pump installers, enabling a more digital and efficient installation process for heat pumps.

Through this, autarc is reducing the hurdles to decarbonizing single-family homes and small apartment buildings in Europe, with the goal to help with the planning and designing of 1 million heat pumps by 2030.

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take responsibility and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Machine Learning Engineer(d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

truemetrics helps organizations to navigate the world more efficiently. We are solving one of the biggest pain points in last mile delivery: how to get parcels, groceries, and food to the right door faster and more efficiently.

Our technology sits in the smartphone of the courier and understands where they park and enter a building. Our technology is right now mapping locations in Kasachstan, Qatar, Germany, Switzerland, the UK and many other countries.

Who we are

We are a tech-driven, customer-obsessed company with a small but highly skilled team, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in mapping and positioning.

We thrive on autonomy, ownership, and speed—which means we’re looking for curious problem-solvers who love tackling hard challenges and making an immediate impact. If you want structure, rigid processes, and a slow corporate environment, this is not the place for you.

Why join us?


Real Impact: Solve practical challenges that help thousands of delivery drivers navigate cities more efficiently.
Collaborative Environment: Work closely with a tight-knit team of founders and engineers scaling the company.
Technical Depth: Tackle advanced problems in positioning, sensor fusion, and large-scale data processing.
Industry Shaping: Influence the future of AI-driven mapping technology in a rapidly growing sector.
Global Ambition: Join a startup partnering with top logistics companies like GLS, DPD, and Snoonu.
Dynamic Culture: Experience the fast-paced environment of a Silicon Valley-connected startup. We are backed by some of the most successful investors in the world like Y-Combinator, Soma Capital or Rebel Fund.


Why NOT to join us?

If you’re looking for a big team, a slow-paced environment, or a job where you can coast along without ownership, this probably isn’t the right fit. We move fast, iterate quickly, and expect everyone to contribute with initiative and creativity.

Requirements


You are based in Berlin or willing to relocate within four weeks of starting.
You thrive in a dynamic startup environment, where fast development cycles and quick deployment are essential.
You have 4+ years of experience in software engineering, data analysis, or software engineering management.
You meet most of the following criteria:
Strong Python skills: You have at least 3-5 years of hands-on coding experience.
Data Visualization & Data Science: You enjoy making complex data understandable and have a solid background in Data Science or Mathematics, especially in working with geospatial data.
Cloud Expertise: You are familiar with AWS architecture and comfortable working with serverless tools (e.g., AWS Lambda, Athena, S3).
Customer-Focused Mindset: You enjoy working closely with customers, helping them get the most out of the product, and explaining technical concepts in an accessible way.
Allrounder: You are fine with switching between roles. Sometimes you are a project manager, sometimes a Data Scientist, sometimes a Backend engineer or QA engineer.

Your Role at Truemetrics

Data Exploration, Analysis & Improvement


Analyze and prepare data: By preparing data in a way that is easy to understand, you ensure our customers receive meaningful insights.
Customer Success & Onboarding: You help present our product to customers and continuously improve the early onboarding experience.
Support POCs & Pilot Projects: You help manage proof-of-concept (POC) and pilot projects, ensuring smooth execution and learning opportunities.


Software Engineering


Troubleshooting & Data Quality: If something breaks in our data, you investigate the root cause and propose solutions. If everything burns, you are playing the detective to find out what didn’t went well
Prototyping & Innovation: You design and implement early prototypes for new features and contribute ideas for improving our algorithms and data processing techniques.


How to Apply


Include the role's title in your subject line.
Please include your CV .
Please tell us why you think you would be a good fit for this role, be specific.
Do you have an impressive GitHub repo to prove your skills? Great!

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Ability to manage multiple projects in a fast-paced environment.
Experience working with large-scale geospatial and sensor data and familiarity with remote sensing a plus.
Full working proficiency in English. German is a plus.


Benefits:


Opportunity: Be part of our journey from the very beginning, working on an equal footing with the leadership team to build a new company.
Impact: Make a daily and active contribution to combating climate change, promoting consumer education, and fostering fair conditions for our climate-conscious farmers.
Autonomy: Take ownership of your projects and enjoy a high degree of creative freedom.
Competitive package: Receive a competitive salary and have the opportunity to participate in our VSIP program.
Flexible work model: At Klim, we foster a flexible, hybrid work approach and facilitate hybrid/remote work (within Germany). It is advantageous for this role if you live in Berlin or can be present in our office regularly.
Additional benefits: We offer membership in the Urban Sports Club or the Deutschlandticket, team lunches (if in Berlin) and regular team events.


At Klim, we believe that a thriving workplace is built on the diverse backgrounds, talents, and perspectives of our team. We grow stronger together by embracing and building on each individual’s unique strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. All hiring and personnel decisions are made solely based on qualifications, performance, and the needs of the company—ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for all.

If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply. You might be the perfect fit for our team in ways you don’t yet realise!

Together with your colleagues you apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems. You independently conduct rigorous experiments while also contributing well-designed features to our codebase.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take responsibility and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures.

truemetrics helps organizations to navigate the world more efficiently. We are solving one of the biggest pain points in last mile delivery: how to get parcels, groceries, and food to the right door faster and more efficiently.

Our technology sits in the smartphone of the courier and understands where they park and enter a building. Our technology is right now mapping locations in Kasachstan, Qatar, Germany, Switzerland, the UK and many other countries.

Who we are

We are a tech-driven, customer-obsessed company with a small but highly skilled team, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in mapping and positioning.

We thrive on autonomy, ownership, and speed—which means we’re looking for curious problem-solvers who love tackling hard challenges and making an immediate impact. If you want structure, rigid processes, and a slow corporate environment, this is not the place for you.

Why join us?


Real Impact: Solve practical challenges that help thousands of delivery drivers navigate cities more efficiently.
Collaborative Environment: Work closely with a tight-knit team of founders and engineers scaling the company.
Technical Depth: Tackle advanced problems in positioning, sensor fusion, and large-scale data processing.
Industry Shaping: Influence the future of AI-driven mapping technology in a rapidly growing sector.
Global Ambition: Join a startup partnering with top logistics companies like GLS, DPD, and Snoonu.
Dynamic Culture: Experience the fast-paced environment of a Silicon Valley-connected startup. We are backed by some of the most successful investors in the world like Y-Combinator, Soma Capital or Rebel Fund.


Why NOT to join us?

If you’re looking for a big team, a slow-paced environment, or a job where you can coast along without ownership, this probably isn’t the right fit. We move fast, iterate quickly, and expect everyone to contribute with initiative and creativity.

Requirements


You are based in Berlin or willing to relocate within four weeks of starting.
You thrive in a dynamic startup environment, where fast development cycles and quick deployment are essential.
You have 4+ years of experience in software engineering, data analysis, or software engineering management.
You meet most of the following criteria:
Strong Python skills: You have at least 3-5 years of hands-on coding experience.
Data Visualization & Data Science: You enjoy making complex data understandable and have a solid background in Data Science or Mathematics, especially in working with geospatial data.
Cloud Expertise: You are familiar with AWS architecture and comfortable working with serverless tools (e.g., AWS Lambda, Athena, S3).
Customer-Focused Mindset: You enjoy working closely with customers, helping them get the most out of the product, and explaining technical concepts in an accessible way.
Allrounder: You are fine with switching between roles. Sometimes you are a project manager, sometimes a Data Scientist, sometimes a Backend engineer or QA engineer.

Your Role at Truemetrics

Data Exploration, Analysis & Improvement


Analyze and prepare data: By preparing data in a way that is easy to understand, you ensure our customers receive meaningful insights.
Customer Success & Onboarding: You help present our product to customers and continuously improve the early onboarding experience.
Support POCs & Pilot Projects: You help manage proof-of-concept (POC) and pilot projects, ensuring smooth execution and learning opportunities.


Software Engineering


Troubleshooting & Data Quality: If something breaks in our data, you investigate the root cause and propose solutions. If everything burns, you are playing the detective to find out what didn’t went well
Prototyping & Innovation: You design and implement early prototypes for new features and contribute ideas for improving our algorithms and data processing techniques.


How to Apply


Include the role's title in your subject line.
Please include your CV .
Please tell us why you think you would be a good fit for this role, be specific.
Do you have an impressive GitHub repo to prove your skills? Great!

You translate biomedical challenges into concrete machine learning research roadmaps and coordinate their execution. Together with your colleagues you develop elegant solutions to complex problems, conduct rigorous experiments and finally convince your stakeholders with crystal clear presentations.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

At Faculty, we transform organisational performance through safe, impactful and human-centric AI.

With a decade of experience, we provide over 300 global customers with software, bespoke AI consultancy, and Fellows from our award winning Fellowship programme.

Our expert team brings together leaders from across government, academia and global tech giants to solve the biggest challenges in applied AI.

Should you join us, you’ll have the chance to work with, and learn from, some of the brilliant minds who are bringing Frontier AI to the frontlines of the world.

We operate a hybrid way of working, meaning that you'll split your time across client location, Faculty's Old Street office and working from home depending on the needs of the project. For this role, you can expect to be client-side for up-to three days per week at times and working either from home or our Old street office for the rest of your time.

About The Role

You will design, build, and deploy production-grade software, infrastructure, and MLOps systems that leverage machine learning. The work you do will help our customers solve a broad range of high-impact problems in our Defence team - examples of which can be found here.

Because of the potential to work with our clients in the National Security space, you will need to be eligible for Security Clearance, details of which are outlined when you click through to apply.

What You'll Be Doing

You are engineering-focused, with a keen interest and working knowledge of operationalised machine learning. You have a desire to take cutting-edge ML applications into the real world. You will develop new methodologies and champion best practices for managing AI systems deployed at scale, with regard to technical, ethical and practical requirements. You will support both technical, and non-technical stakeholders, to deploy ML to solve real-world problems.

Our Machine Learning Engineerings Are Responsible For The Engineering Aspects Of Our Customer Delivery Projects. As a Machine Learning Engineer, You’ll Be Essential To Helping Us Achieve That Goal By:


Building software and infrastructure that leverages Machine Learning;
Creating reusable, scalable tools to enable better delivery of ML systems
Working with our customers to help understand their needs
Working with data scientists and engineers to develop best practices and new technologies; and
Implementing and developing Faculty’s view on what it means to operationalise ML software.


As a Rapidly Growing Organisation, Roles Are Dynamic And Subject To Change. Your Role Will Evolve Alongside Business Needs, But You Can Expect Your Key Responsibilities To Include:


Working in cross-functional teams of engineers, data scientists, designers and managers to deliver technically sophisticated, high-impact systems.
Working with senior engineers to scope projects and design systems
Providing technical expertise to our customers
Technical Delivery


Who We're Looking For

You can view our company principles here. We look for individuals who share these principles and our excitement to help our customers reap the rewards of AI responsibly.

We Like People Who Combine Expertise And Ambition With Optimism -- Who Are Interested In Changing The World For The Better -- And Have The Drive And Intelligence To Make It Happen. If You’re The Right Candidate For Us, You Probably:


Think scientifically, even if you’re not a scientist - you test assumptions, seek evidence and are always looking for opportunities to improve the way we do things.
Love finding new ways to solve old problems - when it comes to your work and professional development, you don’t believe in ‘good enough’. You always seek new ways to solve old challenges.
Are pragmatic and outcome-focused - you know how to balance the big picture with the little details and know a great idea is useless if it can’t be executed in the real world.


To Succeed In This Role, You’ll Need The Following - These Are Illustrative Requirements And We Don’t Expect All Applicants To Have Experience In Everything (70% Is a Rough Guide):


Understanding of, and experience with the full machine learning lifecycle
Working with Data Scientists to deploy trained machine learning models into production environments
Working with a range of models developed using common frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
Experience with software engineering best practices and developing applications in Python.
Technical experience of cloud architecture, security, deployment, and open-source tools ideally with one of the 3 major cloud providers (AWS, GPS or Azure)
Demonstrable experience with containers and specifically Docker and Kubernetes
An understanding of the core concepts of probability and statistics and familiarity with common supervised and unsupervised learning techniques
Demonstrable experience of managing/mentoring more junior members of the team
Outstanding verbal and written communication.
Excitement about working in a dynamic role with the autonomy and freedom you need to take ownership of problems and see them through to execution


What We Can Offer You:

The Faculty team is diverse and distinctive, and we all come from different personal, professional and organisational backgrounds. We all have one thing in common: we are driven by a deep intellectual curiosity that powers us forward each day.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You’ll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to achieve our collective goals.

Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet.

We are looking for a talented Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer to join our dynamic data team at Mumsnet. You will play a key role in building data-driven products and leveraging AI/LLM technologies to enhance our platform and user experience. Your work will have a direct impact on our 9 million users, driving innovation through machine learning and data analytics.

You will be responsible for designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models, as well as integrating AI-driven solutions via APIs. Strong communication skills are essential, as you will collaborate with teams across product, engineering, and commercial to translate their requirements into actual data products. We have successfully built our very own AI platform, MumsGPT, which is a combination of AI-agents that bring together and analyse all Mumsnet's qualitative and quantitative data in a super efficient and user friendly way. In this role, you will be responsible for maintaining and improving the platform as well as building new ML/AI driven data products.

This is a fantastic opportunity to be part of an exciting, growing team that is shaping the future of Mumsnet with cutting-edge data science and AI solutions.

What You'll Be Doing

Every day in the Mumsnet data team is different. We work with web traffic, textual data, and large datasets to develop new data products and AI-powered features. Your responsibilities will include:


Machine Learning & AI Development:
Designing, training, and deploying machine learning models for predictive analytics, personalization, and automation, with a particular focus on NLP applications
Leveraging AI/LLMs (e.g., GPT, Gemini, LLaMA) for content moderation, entity extraction, analysing and summarising huge amounts of text data, and other business needs
Data Product Development:
Building and maintaining scalable data products, pipelines, and REST APIs
Implementing ML models in production, ensuring performance, monitoring, and scalability

Why work for us?

We focus on steady, sustainable growth, putting purpose (to make parent's lives easier) before profit. We expect great performance, agility and collaboration in every role; cross-team working with talented, clever people is the best part of life at Mumsnet. Most importantly we're looking for candidates with a growth mindset - we know everyone makes mistakes, the important thing is to learn from them and to share your learnings.

We embraced flexible and home working a long time before COVID, and we care much more about outputs than hours on the clock. We don't only want to hire the best people: we want to retain them. If you need some flexibility, let us know and we'll do our best.

We're committed to diversity and quality (see our policy ) and we think we're second to none in the all-round support we offer to parents and carers at work (see our parental leave policies ). Working for Mumsnet means never having to pretend you don't have a family or other commitments, and we promise never to keep you away from a school appointment. We are also proud to be a London Living Wage employer and we have never used unpaid interns.

We have a healthy line-up of sandwich lunches, knowledge sessions, book clubs, yoga sessions, monthly socials and sports teams, as well as an unhealthy line-up of staff parties at Kentish Town's excellent pubs and restaurants, and McDonald's deliveries for the mornings after.

WFH

We've continued to embrace flexibility and remote working to the max. You'll only be required to be in the office two days a week (although you can go in more often if you wish). We're flexible with hours and happy to accommodate personal commitments like picking the kids up from school. We're more interested in output than presenteeism, so if you need to move things around, we can probably work it out.

How We'll Support You


Weekly or bi-weekly 1-1 with line manager to review progress, agree roles, provide support;
Formal 6-month appraisal system;
Buddy and Mentor Programmes;
LinkedIn online learning - bi-weekly DEAL(Drop Everything And Learn) sessions, training to be agreed with your line manager;
Ongoing on the job training from your line manager


This role sits within our data team and reports into the Chief Data Officer and is based at our offices in Kentish Town. This role is envisaged as full-time but we are happy to consider flexible options for the right candidate.

If all of this sounds good to you, please apply with your CV and a covering letter that demonstrates some of the qualities we're looking for.

Requirements


Technical Skills:
Strong proficiency in Python and relevant frameworks/libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, LangChain, LangGraph, Hugging Face, etc.)
Experience working with LLMs and AI models in production environments
Experience building RAG-based applications and vector databases
Experience with graph databases like Neo4J or Memgraph
Hands-on experience with SQL and cloud platforms (GCP, AWS, or Azure)
Experience building APIs for AI/ML models using FastAPI, Flask, or similar frameworks

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Your models don’t just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you —read on.

AlgaeCal is looking for a top-tier Data Scientist Intern who can turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.




This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we’re driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world’s only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you’ll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.




This job might be for you if you’ve got…

Experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You’ve built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don’t just analyze numbers—you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You’ve used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities.
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that’ll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it’s regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don’t just apply models—you understand how they work under the hood.
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics.
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You’ve worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization.
Familiarity with AI and deep learning principles. You know how artificial intelligence models (including RAG) can be adapted to automate and optimize business tasks. You’ve explored the potential of AI beyond just theory.
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You’re the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point.
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don’t just crunch numbers—you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You’re proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability.
Industry know-how that adds value. If you’ve got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that’s a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI.




Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you’re nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can’t wait to meet you.




Other Qualities You’ll Need

At AlgaeCal we’re going to insist that you have these 3 qualities:

You’re humble––you put the team and others’ needs ahead of your own
You’re hungry to learn more
You’re people smart––in the sense that you’re a great teammate

The truth is, if you don’t have these qualities you won’t last long at AlgaeCal. So if you’re missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.




What Will You Earn?

We believe in rewarding top talent. Let’s talk about salary once we’ve had the chance to get to know you better. Rest assured, we’re generous and offer above-market pay for the right person. If you bring the skills and experience, we’ll make sure the compensation reflects that.




You’ll also enjoy the following benefits:

Monthly team events and activities
Flexible Stat Holidays with the option to bank days for later use
Weekly team lunches
Casual dress code
Incredible dog friendly, Yaletown office one block from SkyTrain
Remote working is okay with us too.

And above all, you’ll join a team that you’ll never want to leave. Culture is everything to us. Yes, we work extremely hard to change as many people’s lives as possible. But we know how to have fun and reward ourselves too.

About Us:

Eupraxia is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing locally delivered, extended-release products that have the potential to address therapeutic areas with high unmet medical need. DiffuSphere™, a proprietary, polymer-based micro-sphere technology, is designed to facilitate targeted drug delivery of both existing and novel drugs. The technology is designed to support an extended duration of effect and delivery of drugs in a hyper-localized fashion, targeting only the tissues that physicians want to treat. We believe the potential for fewer adverse events may be achieved through the precision targeting and the stable and flat delivery of the active ingredient when using the DiffuSphere™ technology, versus the peaks and troughs seen with more traditional drug delivery methods. The precision of Eupraxia's DiffuSphere™ technology platform has the potential to augment and transform existing FDA-approved drugs to improve their safety, tolerability, efficacy and duration of effect. The potential uses in therapeutic areas may go beyond pain and inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, where Eupraxia currently is developing advanced treatments, also to be applicable in oncology, infectious disease and other critical disease areas.

 

Eupraxia's EP-104GI is currently in a Phase 1b/2a trial, the RESOLVE trial, for the treatment of EoE. EP-104GI is administered as an injection into the esophageal wall, providing local delivery of drug. This is a unique treatment approach for EoE. Eupraxia also recently completed a Phase 2b clinical trial (SPRINGBOARD) of EP-104IAR for the treatment of pain due to knee osteoarthritis. The trial met its primary endpoint and three of the four secondary endpoints. In addition, Eupraxia is developing a pipeline of later and earlier-stage long-acting formulations. Potential pipeline indications include candidates for other inflammatory joint indications and oncology, each designed to improve on the activity and tolerability of currently approved drugs. For further details about Eupraxia, please visit the Company's website at: www.eupraxiapharma.com.

 

We are looking for someone who would like to work for a fast-paced, growing company that fosters a creative spirit and integrated teamwork and who is eligible to work in Canada.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

About BuildOps:

BuildOps is a fast-paced, high-growth start-up committed to transforming a $300B+ industry through an innovative all-in-one SaaS platform. Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking Commercial Specialty Contractors from the world of pen and paper to cloud-based, data-driven operations. Our leadership team has deep experience in both the Construction and SaaS technology industries, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful start-up exits.

BuildOps has more than doubled year-over-year while raising over $140 million in total funding (including a recent round in Feb 2024). Top-tier investors like Founders Fund, Siemens, B Capital Group (BCG's venture arm), 01 Advisors, and more have backed BuildOps! Also, Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, just joined our board, adding to an impressive group of investors/advisors including former President of Salesforce, Gavin Patterson; CAA founder Michael Ovitz; NFL legend Joe Montana; former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet.

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

As a Data Scientist you will shape the future of people-facing and business-facing products we build at Pinterest. Your expertise in quantitative modeling, experimentation and algorithms will be utilized to solve some of the most complex engineering challenges at the company. You will collaborate on a wide array of product and business problems with a diverse set of cross-functional partners across Product, Engineering, Design, Research, Product Analytics, Data Engineering and others. The results of your work will influence and uplevel our product development teams while introducing greater scientific rigor into the real world products serving hundreds of millions of pinners, creators, advertisers and merchants around the world.

What You’ll Do


Develop best practices for instrumentation and experimentation and communicate those to product engineering teams to help us fulfill our mission - to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love
Bring scientific rigor and statistical methods to the challenges of product creation, development and improvement with an appreciation for the behaviors of our Pinners
Build and prototype analysis pipelines iteratively to provide insights at scale while developing comprehensive knowledge of data structures and metrics, advocating for changes where needed for product development
Work cross-functionally to build and communicate key insights, and collaborate closely with product managers, engineers, designers, and researchers to help build the next experiences on Pinterest



What We’re Looking For


Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a relevant field such as Data Science or Statistics, or equivalent experience
2+ years of experience analyzing data in a fast-paced, data-driven environment with proven ability to apply scientific methods to solve real-world problems on web-scale data
Extensive experience solving analytical problems using quantitative approaches including in the fields of Statistical Modeling or other related fields
A scientifically rigorous approach to analysis and data, and a well-tuned sense of skepticism, attention to detail and commitment to high-quality, results-oriented output
Ability to manipulate large data sets with high dimensionality and complexity; fluency in SQL (or other database languages) and a scripting language (Python or R)
Excellent communication skills and ability to explain learnings to both technical and non-technical partners
A team player who’s able to partner with cross-functional leadership to quickly turn insights into actions



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times per half and therefore needs to be situated in a commutable distance from the Toronto office (85 Richmond St. W)

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.

We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.

Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.

Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.

Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.

Our guiding principles:


Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated



Compensation and benefits:


The range for base pay is 100$k - 125$k which is dependent on level of experience, performance and choice of stock option compensation
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
Four weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 calendar days of the year
