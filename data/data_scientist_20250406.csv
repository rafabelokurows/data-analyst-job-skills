About Us

Right now, 25% of CO2 emissions in Europe are caused by heating our buildings. In order for this to be reduced, the transition towards renewable energy needs to be simplified and made more accessible. There are too few installers to meet the growing demand for heat pumps, and a solution to match this trend needs to be brought to the market.

autarc is developing the leading operating system (OS) for heat pump installers, enabling a more digital and efficient installation process for heat pumps.

Through this, autarc is reducing the hurdles to decarbonizing single-family homes and small apartment buildings in Europe, with the goal to help with the planning and designing of 1 million heat pumps by 2030.

As a Berlin-based AgriTech start-up, we’re empowering farmers to restore soil, boost biodiversity, and capture carbon—all while earning revenue through our platform.

Backed by $22 million in Series A funding, we’re expanding globally, partnering with major food industry leaders like Nestlé and Kaufland to help them reduce emissions along their supply chains, while making them more resilient and profitable at the same time. Since 2020, we’ve supported 3,500 farmers, covering 700,000 hectares (5% of Germany’s farmland!).

If you’re passionate about building a sustainable food system and driving real climate impact, join us and help create a healthier planet!

Your mission

At Klim, we've pioneered the world’s first digital platform for regenerative agriculture, empowering thousands of farmers to champion sustainable practices. We provide financial compensation to farmers for their regenerative practices and offer high-quality advisory services. We connect the farmers with forward-thinking companies who want to invest in a greener future. By purchasing the carbon credits generated from these sustainable practices or implementing regenerative agriculture in their food supply chain, these companies not only fulfill their environmental responsibilities but also fuel a cycle of positive change.

Now, we're looking for a Data Scientist to join our dynamic team. In this role, you'll have the opportunity to be at the forefront of change, helping develop sophisticated data products to aid farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture.

Backed by visionary investors like Atlantic Food Labs, Ananda Impact Ventures, and AgFunder, we're on a trajectory of growth and innovation. If you're ready to make a difference and be part of something truly meaningful, join us at Klim, and together, let's cultivate a brighter tomorrow for all.

Preferred knowledge of agronomy and agricultural topics.
Proficiency in Python and SQL with experience using ML frameworks and libraries such as PyTorch and scikit-learn.
Familiarity with the AWS ecosystem.
Experience collaborating with engineering and product teams, with proficiency in version controlling (e.g., Git).
Ability to translate business requirements into quantitative solutions and clearly communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders.
Ability to manage multiple projects in a fast-paced environment.
Experience working with large-scale geospatial and sensor data and familiarity with remote sensing a plus.
Full working proficiency in English. German is a plus.


Benefits:


Opportunity: Be part of our journey from the very beginning, working on an equal footing with the leadership team to build a new company.
Impact: Make a daily and active contribution to combating climate change, promoting consumer education, and fostering fair conditions for our climate-conscious farmers.
Autonomy: Take ownership of your projects and enjoy a high degree of creative freedom.
Competitive package: Receive a competitive salary and have the opportunity to participate in our VSIP program.
Flexible work model: At Klim, we foster a flexible, hybrid work approach and facilitate hybrid/remote work (within Germany). It is advantageous for this role if you live in Berlin or can be present in our office regularly.
Additional benefits: We offer membership in the Urban Sports Club or the Deutschlandticket, team lunches (if in Berlin) and regular team events.


At Klim, we believe that a thriving workplace is built on the diverse backgrounds, talents, and perspectives of our team. We grow stronger together by embracing and building on each individual’s unique strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. All hiring and personnel decisions are made solely based on qualifications, performance, and the needs of the company—ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for all.

If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply. You might be the perfect fit for our team in ways you don’t yet realise!

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Staff Machine Learning Research Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics..

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability and ESG teams on the frontlines of solving the climate crisis.




We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients—including some of the world's largest firms—we’re already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.




Backed by €7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We’re based at the heart of Europe’s AI revolution—the AI Campus in Berlin—where we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.


Your role


As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to accelerate transition to a sustainable planet. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as exploring new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.





Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.


Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.


Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs and ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring how AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.


Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction and helps achieve our mission.



Your profile

What type of person we're looking for...



Knowledgable and experienced with building AI/LLM products: You have strong knowledge and experience of thinking through and building AI/LLM systems from prototyping and experiments through to deployment, evaluation, monitoring and improvement in production.


Practical Implementer: You are a ‘builder’ and aim to pragmatically integrate AI into real-world products, moving beyond research to create tangible, impactful solutions.


Personal agency and drive: must have personal agency, drive and ability to figure things out, learn and iterate to drive initiatives forward to success.


Innovative Thinker: You're driven by curiosity and continually experiment with new models, techniques and technologies in the rapidly evolving AI/LLM space.


Excellent Communicator: You have outstanding verbal and written communication skills in English, and can build strong relationships with internal teams and external partners.


Collaborative and Organised: You thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve success. Preferably with experience in start-ups.


Passion for ESG and Sustainability: You are motivated by using your skills to help address climate change and enthusiastic about building tools that help ESG and sustainability teams.



Technical Skills



Minimum of 4 years of experience: As an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI/ML Product Engineer or related roles.


Fluency in python: Including strong proficiency with base python as well as modern frameworks (e.g. fastAPI)


Experience with LLMs: Including core concepts around foundation models, prompt engineering and chains etc. as well as preferably some experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain). Experience using LLMs to build RAG systems and/or other real-world use-cases related to document processing would be a major bonus.


Experience with LLM evaluation: Including how to collect labelled data and systematically evaluate RAG and other real world LLM applications, preferably with experience in evaluation tools and frameworks (e.g. Langsmith)


Experience with production grade applications: Including familiarity with software development tools and practices for production applications (e.g git, CI/CD, containerization) and preferably some experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment (e.g. GCP, Modal). Any experience with cost/latency implications of deploying LLMs at scale would be a major bonus.


Fluency in English: With the ability to clearly communicate complex topics to diverse stakeholders. Any other European language would be a bonus.


Understanding or interest in sustainability: Including an interest in sustainability climate, or ESG topics and a desire to use your skills to help accelerate the climate transition.
Even if your experience doesn’t align precisely with all the criteria, we encourage you to apply. Many people miss out on opportunities because they feel they don’t fit every requirement—we believe in growth, not perfection!



What we offer



Competitive Remuneration: As a core member of our team, you will receive a competitive salary and equity package, reflecting your role in shaping Briink’s future.


Purpose-Driven Mission: ESG data has the power to create a more sustainable world, but today it presents more challenges than solutions. We believe AI can change that. Be part of the transition to an AI-powered, sustainable world.


Flexible Working: Our work philosophy is built on flexibility. While we do like to come to the office (in Berlin or London) to collaborate in person, this is a hybrid role with opportunities for some remote work within European time zones.


Trust and Ownership: At Briink, we empower you to own your projects with the option for growing into new roles. We believe in giving people autonomy and trust to drive your own initiatives.


Dynamic Work Environment: Based at the Merantix AI Campus, Berlin’s hub for AI innovation, you’ll work in a diverse, collaborative environment. With frequent events and opportunities for cross-company collaboration, you’ll be part of a thriving ecosystem of AI startups and experts.

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

As a Berlin-based AgriTech start-up, we’re empowering farmers to restore soil, boost biodiversity, and capture carbon—all while earning revenue through our platform.

Backed by $22 million in Series A funding, we’re expanding globally, partnering with major food industry leaders like Nestlé and Kaufland to help them reduce emissions along their supply chains, while making them more resilient and profitable at the same time. Since 2020, we’ve supported 3,500 farmers, covering 700,000 hectares (5% of Germany’s farmland!).

If you’re passionate about building a sustainable food system and driving real climate impact, join us and help create a healthier planet!

At Klim, we've pioneered the world’s first digital platform for regenerative agriculture, empowering thousands of farmers to champion sustainable practices. We provide financial compensation to farmers for their regenerative practices and offer high-quality advisory services. We connect the farmers with forward-thinking companies who want to invest in a greener future. By purchasing the carbon credits generated from these sustainable practices or implementing regenerative agriculture in their food supply chain, these companies not only fulfill their environmental responsibilities but also fuel a cycle of positive change.

Now, we're looking for a Data Scientist to join our dynamic team. In this role, you'll have the opportunity to be at the forefront of change, helping develop sophisticated data products to aid farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture.

Backed by visionary investors like Atlantic Food Labs, Ananda Impact Ventures, and AgFunder, we're on a trajectory of growth and innovation. If you're ready to make a difference and be part of something truly meaningful, join us at Klim, and together, let's cultivate a brighter tomorrow for all.

Build and optimize ML models for agronomic recommendations using diverse datasets to generate insights.
Proactively assess and identify opportunities for data science applications and data products, such as LLMs, to advance our product and the customer experience.
Build robust, scalable data models to support ML systems and improve data accessibility.
Collaborate cross-functionally with agronomists, engineers, and product teams.


Your profile:


MSc/PhD in data science, agronomy, computer science, or related fields.
Proven track record in building recommendation systems or predictive data science projects, ideally related to agriculture.
Experience using LLMs to build chatbots and deploying them in production.
Preferred knowledge of agronomy and agricultural topics.
Proficiency in Python and SQL with experience using ML frameworks and libraries such as PyTorch and scikit-learn.
Familiarity with the AWS ecosystem.
Experience collaborating with engineering and product teams, with proficiency in version controlling (e.g., Git).
Ability to translate business requirements into quantitative solutions and clearly communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders.
Ability to manage multiple projects in a fast-paced environment.
Experience working with large-scale geospatial and sensor data and familiarity with remote sensing a plus.
Full working proficiency in English. German is a plus.


Benefits:


Opportunity: Be part of our journey from the very beginning, working on an equal footing with the leadership team to build a new company.
Impact: Make a daily and active contribution to combating climate change, promoting consumer education, and fostering fair conditions for our climate-conscious farmers.
Autonomy: Take ownership of your projects and enjoy a high degree of creative freedom.
Competitive package: Receive a competitive salary and have the opportunity to participate in our VSIP program.
Flexible work model: At Klim, we foster a flexible, hybrid work approach and facilitate hybrid/remote work (within Germany). It is advantageous for this role if you live in Berlin or can be present in our office regularly.
Additional benefits: We offer membership in the Urban Sports Club or the Deutschlandticket, team lunches (if in Berlin) and regular team events.


At Klim, we believe that a thriving workplace is built on the diverse backgrounds, talents, and perspectives of our team. We grow stronger together by embracing and building on each individual’s unique strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. All hiring and personnel decisions are made solely based on qualifications, performance, and the needs of the company—ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for all.

If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply. You might be the perfect fit for our team in ways you don’t yet realise!

The Transaction Analytics team are integrated with and work alongside the core due diligence teams to provide additional deeper insights and challenge value drivers with innovative solutions and advanced digital capabilities.

We are looking for a talented Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer to join our dynamic data team at Mumsnet. You will play a key role in building data-driven products and leveraging AI/LLM technologies to enhance our platform and user experience. Your work will have a direct impact on our 9 million users, driving innovation through machine learning and data analytics.

You will be responsible for designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models, as well as integrating AI-driven solutions via APIs. Strong communication skills are essential, as you will collaborate with teams across product, engineering, and commercial to translate their requirements into actual data products. We have successfully built our very own AI platform, MumsGPT, which is a combination of AI-agents that bring together and analyse all Mumsnet's qualitative and quantitative data in a super efficient and user friendly way. In this role, you will be responsible for maintaining and improving the platform as well as building new ML/AI driven data products.

This is a fantastic opportunity to be part of an exciting, growing team that is shaping the future of Mumsnet with cutting-edge data science and AI solutions.

What You'll Be Doing

Every day in the Mumsnet data team is different. We work with web traffic, textual data, and large datasets to develop new data products and AI-powered features. Your responsibilities will include:


Machine Learning & AI Development:
Designing, training, and deploying machine learning models for predictive analytics, personalization, and automation, with a particular focus on NLP applications
Leveraging AI/LLMs (e.g., GPT, Gemini, LLaMA) for content moderation, entity extraction, analysing and summarising huge amounts of text data, and other business needs
Data Product Development:
Building and maintaining scalable data products, pipelines, and REST APIs
Implementing ML models in production, ensuring performance, monitoring, and scalability
Data Engineering & Analytics:
Working with ingestion and processing of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources
Collaborating with team members to optimize data infrastructure and ETL workflows
Stakeholder Collaboration & Communication:
Partnering with the product team to implement data-driven features
Presenting insights and recommendations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Documenting and sharing best practices for AI/ML model development


Why work for us?

We focus on steady, sustainable growth, putting purpose (to make parent's lives easier) before profit. We expect great performance, agility and collaboration in every role; cross-team working with talented, clever people is the best part of life at Mumsnet. Most importantly we're looking for candidates with a growth mindset - we know everyone makes mistakes, the important thing is to learn from them and to share your learnings.

We embraced flexible and home working a long time before COVID, and we care much more about outputs than hours on the clock. We don't only want to hire the best people: we want to retain them. If you need some flexibility, let us know and we'll do our best.

We're committed to diversity and quality (see our policy ) and we think we're second to none in the all-round support we offer to parents and carers at work (see our parental leave policies ). Working for Mumsnet means never having to pretend you don't have a family or other commitments, and we promise never to keep you away from a school appointment. We are also proud to be a London Living Wage employer and we have never used unpaid interns.

We have a healthy line-up of sandwich lunches, knowledge sessions, book clubs, yoga sessions, monthly socials and sports teams, as well as an unhealthy line-up of staff parties at Kentish Town's excellent pubs and restaurants, and McDonald's deliveries for the mornings after.

WFH

We've continued to embrace flexibility and remote working to the max. You'll only be required to be in the office two days a week (although you can go in more often if you wish). We're flexible with hours and happy to accommodate personal commitments like picking the kids up from school. We're more interested in output than presenteeism, so if you need to move things around, we can probably work it out.

How We'll Support You


Weekly or bi-weekly 1-1 with line manager to review progress, agree roles, provide support;
Formal 6-month appraisal system;
Buddy and Mentor Programmes;
LinkedIn online learning - bi-weekly DEAL(Drop Everything And Learn) sessions, training to be agreed with your line manager;
Ongoing on the job training from your line manager


This role sits within our data team and reports into the Chief Data Officer and is based at our offices in Kentish Town. This role is envisaged as full-time but we are happy to consider flexible options for the right candidate.

If all of this sounds good to you, please apply with your CV and a covering letter that demonstrates some of the qualities we're looking for.

Requirements


Technical Skills:
Strong proficiency in Python and relevant frameworks/libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, LangChain, LangGraph, Hugging Face, etc.)
Experience working with LLMs and AI models in production environments
Experience building RAG-based applications and vector databases

We want to make talking to AIs as human as possible.




Today, the highest adoption for voice-first AI interaction is happening in telephony voice agents. But, our personal interactions with banks / medical providers (e.g. GPs) / government (e.g. HMRC) has not changed at all; it’s still the same long queue times, or IVR systems. This is because the current AI telephony voice agent stack is broken - success rates are low, it’s a slow process to get them to work reliably. And this is just in carefully crafted low-risk scenarios where call times are shorter than 2 minutes.




The problems preventing adoption can’t be solved by any amount of data, and we’re re-architecting the underlying machine learning models (speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and LLMs) from the ground up to solve this.




The company was founded by Sid, one of the first 5 technical employee at Wayve.ai (which recently raised $1bn dollars), and Vatsal (who was critical in building Alexa’s first deep learning voice, and studied+taught Maths & CS at Cambridge). Our team is passionate and driven by building products that are deeply loved by the people who use them.




We’re backed by top tier US and European VCs and angels like ex-CTO of CoinBase, ex-VP of Twitter, and ex-CEO of Wayve.ai.




Requirements and Experience

Senior: EITHER

exceptional projects in this space built in spare time along with 2+ years of industry experience in applied research setting OR
1+ of years of extremely relevant experience




Junior/mid-level:

0-2 years of experience + projects training SOTA GenAI models in spare time




What we offer

Environment to do the best work of your life.
Small team, great people.
Opportunity to make cutting-edge research work from scratch for production scenarios
Work with 10s-100s of TBs of data, and >1-10B parameter models.
Change the world (when we succeed): calls will never be the same again
We’ll provide immigration support, we are immigrants ourselves.
Significant equity.




Interview Process

We move with speed, and aim to go from first interview to offer within a week.

Quick 15 mins chat with one of the founders
Take home task and/or 1-3 technical interviews (depending on preferences)
2x Culture interview with co-founders
Paid “work together” session

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Our aim is to revolutionise the way organisations collaborate with sensors, robots and autonomous systems and use the data they generate. We are driven by our determination to help defend our collective democratic values and by our strong belief that an elite group of engineers can make a big difference. We are ambitious, well-funded and building for the long-term.

You will join Arondite at a pivotal moment in the company's journey. Our company is being built by exceptional engineers - people who find high-impact and technically challenging work engaging and exciting, and who consistently deliver outsized impact. You will collaborate with other brilliant minds to solve some of the world's hardest and most important problems.

You will have ownership and autonomy from Day One. There is no corporate ladder at Arondite. From your first day, you will directly influence the design, functionality, and direction of Arondite's product offering. We hire the best people and give them extremely high levels of autonomy; the sky is the limit for an individual with the right ambition.

If you are motivated by our mission and if you want to be part of a growing team of outstanding people, then we want to hear from you.

Requirements

Arondite is looking for an AI Research Engineer to understand our customer's problems and implement solutions using AI.

You will be in developing AI/ML models and deploying them both within our core software product and to edge devices including drones and ground robots. The role will also encompass addressing the wider practicalities and challenges in implementing AI-based systems, including obtaining training data, addressing ethical concerns and explaining model behaviours.

As an early member of the AI team at Arondite, you will be able to shape how we exploit the AI revolution, both as part of products and to accelerate our internal processes.

Your responsibilities will include:


Working with customers to identify and understand their problems
Designing end-to-end AI solutions from the sensor to the user interface
Training and evaluating robust and performant deep learning models to solve real-world challenges
Integrating models into our enterprise software product and into resource-constrained hardware systems

Strong written and verbal communication skills to document your work effectively and present it to relevant stake-holders and users
A passion for identifying and implementing pragmatic solutions to hard problems using AI and conventional algorithms
Excitement about the opportunity to take ownership for building AI within a high-performance, mission-focused team


Ideally, you would also have:


PhD in computer vision, machine learning, robotics, or a related field
Authored publications in top-tier journals and conferences (e.g. CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICCV, ICRA, IROS, TPAMI)
Experience working with MLOps infrastructure or deploying AI models to production, including the associated monitoring, testing and quality assurance (QA)
An understanding of different sensor modalities, their trade-offs, and relevant methods for processing their outputs to drive performance in challenging scenarios
Created and optimised state of the art AI models for resource-constrained hardware
Experience with synthetic data generation or simulation, or collection and management of large real-world datasets

Security clearance

We believe in working closely with defence customers. As a result, this role is likely to require you to hold a clearance or be willing to undergo UK security vetting to Security Check (SC) or above. This normally requires having continuous residency in the UK for at least 5 years.

Office vs hybrid working

We are focused on building a positive, collaborative engineering-driven culture. We therefore believe in making the office a friendly, comfortable and fun place to be, and we try to work from the office where possible. Of course, there are times when it makes sense for you to work from home and that's OK. You may also need to travel to visit customers, depending on your role. But in general you should only apply to join Arondite if you're excited to come into the office and work in person by default.

Application process

Generally, our interview process is comprised of the following stages:


CV submission with initial questions
Introductory Teams call (30 mins)
In-person technical interview (1-2 hours)
Final interview with one of Arondite's Founders (30 mins)

We are looking for a talented Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer to join our dynamic data team at Mumsnet. You will play a key role in building data-driven products and leveraging AI/LLM technologies to enhance our platform and user experience. Your work will have a direct impact on our 9 million users, driving innovation through machine learning and data analytics.

You will be responsible for designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models, as well as integrating AI-driven solutions via APIs. Strong communication skills are essential, as you will collaborate with teams across product, engineering, and commercial to translate their requirements into actual data products. We have successfully built our very own AI platform, MumsGPT, which is a combination of AI-agents that bring together and analyse all Mumsnet's qualitative and quantitative data in a super efficient and user friendly way. In this role, you will be responsible for maintaining and improving the platform as well as building new ML/AI driven data products.

This is a fantastic opportunity to be part of an exciting, growing team that is shaping the future of Mumsnet with cutting-edge data science and AI solutions.

What You'll Be Doing

Every day in the Mumsnet data team is different. We work with web traffic, textual data, and large datasets to develop new data products and AI-powered features. Your responsibilities will include:


Machine Learning & AI Development:
Designing, training, and deploying machine learning models for predictive analytics, personalization, and automation, with a particular focus on NLP applications
Leveraging AI/LLMs (e.g., GPT, Gemini, LLaMA) for content moderation, entity extraction, analysing and summarising huge amounts of text data, and other business needs
Data Product Development:
Building and maintaining scalable data products, pipelines, and REST APIs
Implementing ML models in production, ensuring performance, monitoring, and scalability
Data Engineering & Analytics:
Working with ingestion and processing of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources
Collaborating with team members to optimize data infrastructure and ETL workflows
Stakeholder Collaboration & Communication:
Partnering with the product team to implement data-driven features
Presenting insights and recommendations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Documenting and sharing best practices for AI/ML model development


Why work for us?

We focus on steady, sustainable growth, putting purpose (to make parent's lives easier) before profit. We expect great performance, agility and collaboration in every role; cross-team working with talented, clever people is the best part of life at Mumsnet. Most importantly we're looking for candidates with a growth mindset - we know everyone makes mistakes, the important thing is to learn from them and to share your learnings.

We embraced flexible and home working a long time before COVID, and we care much more about outputs than hours on the clock. We don't only want to hire the best people: we want to retain them. If you need some flexibility, let us know and we'll do our best.

We're committed to diversity and quality (see our policy ) and we think we're second to none in the all-round support we offer to parents and carers at work (see our parental leave policies ). Working for Mumsnet means never having to pretend you don't have a family or other commitments, and we promise never to keep you away from a school appointment. We are also proud to be a London Living Wage employer and we have never used unpaid interns.

We have a healthy line-up of sandwich lunches, knowledge sessions, book clubs, yoga sessions, monthly socials and sports teams, as well as an unhealthy line-up of staff parties at Kentish Town's excellent pubs and restaurants, and McDonald's deliveries for the mornings after.

WFH

We've continued to embrace flexibility and remote working to the max. You'll only be required to be in the office two days a week (although you can go in more often if you wish). We're flexible with hours and happy to accommodate personal commitments like picking the kids up from school. We're more interested in output than presenteeism, so if you need to move things around, we can probably work it out.

How We'll Support You


Weekly or bi-weekly 1-1 with line manager to review progress, agree roles, provide support;
Formal 6-month appraisal system;
Buddy and Mentor Programmes;
LinkedIn online learning - bi-weekly DEAL(Drop Everything And Learn) sessions, training to be agreed with your line manager;
Ongoing on the job training from your line manager


This role sits within our data team and reports into the Chief Data Officer and is based at our offices in Kentish Town. This role is envisaged as full-time but we are happy to consider flexible options for the right candidate.

If all of this sounds good to you, please apply with your CV and a covering letter that demonstrates some of the qualities we're looking for.

Requirements


Technical Skills:
Strong proficiency in Python and relevant frameworks/libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, LangChain, LangGraph, Hugging Face, etc.)
Experience working with LLMs and AI models in production environments
Experience building RAG-based applications and vector databases
Experience with graph databases like Neo4J or Memgraph
Hands-on experience with SQL and cloud platforms (GCP, AWS, or Azure)

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.

We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.

Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.

Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.

Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted.

Our guiding principles:


Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated



Compensation and benefits:


The range for base pay is 100$k - 125$k which is dependent on level of experience, performance and choice of stock option compensation
Employee stock options based on experience level

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Us:

Eupraxia is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing locally delivered, extended-release products that have the potential to address therapeutic areas with high unmet medical need. DiffuSphere™, a proprietary, polymer-based micro-sphere technology, is designed to facilitate targeted drug delivery of both existing and novel drugs. The technology is designed to support an extended duration of effect and delivery of drugs in a hyper-localized fashion, targeting only the tissues that physicians want to treat. We believe the potential for fewer adverse events may be achieved through the precision targeting and the stable and flat delivery of the active ingredient when using the DiffuSphere™ technology, versus the peaks and troughs seen with more traditional drug delivery methods. The precision of Eupraxia's DiffuSphere™ technology platform has the potential to augment and transform existing FDA-approved drugs to improve their safety, tolerability, efficacy and duration of effect. The potential uses in therapeutic areas may go beyond pain and inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, where Eupraxia currently is developing advanced treatments, also to be applicable in oncology, infectious disease and other critical disease areas.

 

Eupraxia's EP-104GI is currently in a Phase 1b/2a trial, the RESOLVE trial, for the treatment of EoE. EP-104GI is administered as an injection into the esophageal wall, providing local delivery of drug. This is a unique treatment approach for EoE. Eupraxia also recently completed a Phase 2b clinical trial (SPRINGBOARD) of EP-104IAR for the treatment of pain due to knee osteoarthritis. The trial met its primary endpoint and three of the four secondary endpoints. In addition, Eupraxia is developing a pipeline of later and earlier-stage long-acting formulations. Potential pipeline indications include candidates for other inflammatory joint indications and oncology, each designed to improve on the activity and tolerability of currently approved drugs. For further details about Eupraxia, please visit the Company's website at: www.eupraxiapharma.com.

 

We are looking for someone who would like to work for a fast-paced, growing company that fosters a creative spirit and integrated teamwork and who is eligible to work in Canada.

 

Job Description: 

Eupraxia is seeking a Research Scientist to contribute to the R&D of pipeline products and the existing lead drug candidate for treating osteoarthritis and eosinophilic esophagitis. The successful candidate will be a highly motivated, independent and creative scientist, ideally with previous academic and/or industrial experience working with extended-release technologies. This position requires someone who can work both independently and in a team environment and has excellent communication skills, attention to detail and organizational skills.

About Us:

Eupraxia is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing locally delivered, extended-release products that have the potential to address therapeutic areas with high unmet medical need. DiffuSphere™, a proprietary, polymer-based micro-sphere technology, is designed to facilitate targeted drug delivery of both existing and novel drugs. The technology is designed to support an extended duration of effect and delivery of drugs in a hyper-localized fashion, targeting only the tissues that physicians want to treat. We believe the potential for fewer adverse events may be achieved through the precision targeting and the stable and flat delivery of the active ingredient when using the DiffuSphere™ technology, versus the peaks and troughs seen with more traditional drug delivery methods. The precision of Eupraxia's DiffuSphere™ technology platform has the potential to augment and transform existing FDA-approved drugs to improve their safety, tolerability, efficacy and duration of effect. The potential uses in therapeutic areas may go beyond pain and inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, where Eupraxia currently is developing advanced treatments, also to be applicable in oncology, infectious disease and other critical disease areas.

 

Eupraxia's EP-104GI is currently in a Phase 1b/2a trial, the RESOLVE trial, for the treatment of EoE. EP-104GI is administered as an injection into the esophageal wall, providing local delivery of drug. This is a unique treatment approach for EoE. Eupraxia also recently completed a Phase 2b clinical trial (SPRINGBOARD) of EP-104IAR for the treatment of pain due to knee osteoarthritis. The trial met its primary endpoint and three of the four secondary endpoints. In addition, Eupraxia is developing a pipeline of later and earlier-stage long-acting formulations. Potential pipeline indications include candidates for other inflammatory joint indications and oncology, each designed to improve on the activity and tolerability of currently approved drugs. For further details about Eupraxia, please visit the Company's website at: www.eupraxiapharma.com.

 

We are looking for someone who would like to work for a fast-paced, growing company that fosters a creative spirit and integrated teamwork and who is eligible to work in Canada.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Support Experience engineering team builds and improves Stripe’s user support from end to end: how users get help within our products, how they get in touch with us when they have questions, and how our teams use internal tools to answer those questions. We’re accountable for the quality and reliability of this support stack and we use data and firsthand user research to continuously improve it.

Providing great support to users of all sizes is culturally important to everyone at Stripe. We are a group of friendly, user-oriented engineers that partner closely with Stripe’s world-class design, product, and operational teams. This includes the external-facing support interfaces (support.stripe.com), content, entry points, internal tooling, case routing, and helping product teams across the company reduce support volume by improving our products. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine support experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive.

What you’ll do

As a Machine Learning Engineer on the Support Experience team, you'll play a crucial role in enhancing our self-serve support experiences. You will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production. For example, we apply LLMs to answer user questions with conversational agents and personalize product documentation, and are building automated systems to solve complex user problems. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers, product managers, and data scientists to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Create and refine pipelines for training and evaluating models in both offline and online environments, with a focus on improving support quality and user satisfaction
Implement ML features that streamline information collection and processing for support agents, enhancing overall support efficiency
Collaborate with product, strategy, and content teams to propose, prioritize, and implement new AI-driven support features and improve answer capabilities
Stay current with the latest developments in ML/AI, particularly in natural language processing and conversational AI, and apply innovative ideas to improve support experiences



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about building ML systems that touch the lives of millions. You have experience developing efficient feature pipelines, building advanced ML models, and deploying them to production. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, have a bias towards action, and thrive in a collaborative environment.

Minimum Requirements


Bachelor's Degree in ML/AI or related field (e.g. math, physics, statistics)
You have a strong technical background, including 5+ years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Proficient with ML libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, as well as Spark
Knowledge of various ML algorithms and model architectures

Previous leadership or mentorship experience
Previous experience building ML solutions focused on support
Experience with LLMs and prompt engineering
Comfortable working with distributed teams across multiple locations and time zones
Proven track record of building and deploying ML systems that have effectively solved ambiguous business problems



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$193,500 - C$290,300. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

About BuildOps:

BuildOps is a fast-paced, high-growth start-up committed to transforming a $300B+ industry through an innovative all-in-one SaaS platform. Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking Commercial Specialty Contractors from the world of pen and paper to cloud-based, data-driven operations. Our leadership team has deep experience in both the Construction and SaaS technology industries, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful start-up exits.

BuildOps has more than doubled year-over-year while raising over $140 million in total funding (including a recent round in Feb 2024). Top-tier investors like Founders Fund, Siemens, B Capital Group (BCG's venture arm), 01 Advisors, and more have backed BuildOps! Also, Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, just joined our board, adding to an impressive group of investors/advisors including former President of Salesforce, Gavin Patterson; CAA founder Michael Ovitz; NFL legend Joe Montana; former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

Our first A.I.-powered solution optimizes ordering, forecasting, and store operations for fresh food departments in brick-and-mortar grocers. With our Fresh Operating System, regional and national grocery retailers have placed $1.6 billion in produce orders across the US and we've helped our partners prevent 34 million pounds of food from going to waste. Working at Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by leveraging uncommonly impactful software – we hope you'll join us!

About The Role

Afresh builds replenishment technology using AI models that are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies. Our team has presented work at multiple industry leading conferences, and we encourage team members to write and present their work publicly.

As an Applied Scientist at Afresh focused on inventory, you will take your existing knowledge of machine learning, operations research, or statistics and apply it to the challenge of inventory estimation for perishables. You will thrive in this role if you love to work on applied, open-ended problems in research and production environments: thorough error analysis, deep understanding of the data you are modeling, feature selection, algorithm implementation, hyperparameter optimization, deployment, and production modeling. We are looking for someone who is equally adept at gaining insights from 8 hours of data analysis or 8 hours of reading papers.

You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core inventory system. This will include modeling inventory counts provided by our users, incoming shipments, sales, and outflow due to spoilage. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.



You will work on improving the accuracy and calibration of our probabilistic inventory models that power our store-level ordering products. You will also drive research development for new product and business challenges.
In your first 3 months, you will acquire a comprehensive understanding of our current inventory system and modern computational approaches to large scale simulation. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and estimation, and you’ll test an experimental improvement to our inventory system.
By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to either inventory estimation, inventory count targeting, or food waste measurement.
By the end of your first year, you will have launched fundamental changes to our core inventory system and led research into extensions like anytime inventory estimation.
We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof.



Skills And Experience



4+ years of industrial or academic experience building mission-critical applied systems.
Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English.
4+ years of experience with Python libraries like Pytorch, Sklearn and Ray.
Fluent in programmatic data analysis using SQL and Pandas.
Excellent data visualization skills.

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.

We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.

Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.

Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach.

Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated

About Us:

Eupraxia is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing locally delivered, extended-release products that have the potential to address therapeutic areas with high unmet medical need. DiffuSphere™, a proprietary, polymer-based micro-sphere technology, is designed to facilitate targeted drug delivery of both existing and novel drugs. The technology is designed to support an extended duration of effect and delivery of drugs in a hyper-localized fashion, targeting only the tissues that physicians want to treat. We believe the potential for fewer adverse events may be achieved through the precision targeting and the stable and flat delivery of the active ingredient when using the DiffuSphere™ technology, versus the peaks and troughs seen with more traditional drug delivery methods. The precision of Eupraxia's DiffuSphere™ technology platform has the potential to augment and transform existing FDA-approved drugs to improve their safety, tolerability, efficacy and duration of effect. The potential uses in therapeutic areas may go beyond pain and inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, where Eupraxia currently is developing advanced treatments, also to be applicable in oncology, infectious disease and other critical disease areas.

 

Eupraxia's EP-104GI is currently in a Phase 1b/2a trial, the RESOLVE trial, for the treatment of EoE. EP-104GI is administered as an injection into the esophageal wall, providing local delivery of drug. This is a unique treatment approach for EoE. Eupraxia also recently completed a Phase 2b clinical trial (SPRINGBOARD) of EP-104IAR for the treatment of pain due to knee osteoarthritis. The trial met its primary endpoint and three of the four secondary endpoints. In addition, Eupraxia is developing a pipeline of later and earlier-stage long-acting formulations. Potential pipeline indications include candidates for other inflammatory joint indications and oncology, each designed to improve on the activity and tolerability of currently approved drugs. For further details about Eupraxia, please visit the Company's website at: www.eupraxiapharma.com.

 

We are looking for someone who would like to work for a fast-paced, growing company that fosters a creative spirit and integrated teamwork and who is eligible to work in Canada.

 

Job Description: 

Eupraxia is seeking a Research Scientist to contribute to the R&D of pipeline products and the existing lead drug candidate for treating osteoarthritis and eosinophilic esophagitis. The successful candidate will be a highly motivated, independent and creative scientist, ideally with previous academic and/or industrial experience working with extended-release technologies.

          <p><strong>Research Scientist</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Us:</strong></p><p>Eupraxia is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing locally delivered, extended-release products that have the potential to address therapeutic areas with high unmet medical need. DiffuSphere™, a proprietary, polymer-based micro-sphere technology, is designed to facilitate targeted drug delivery of both existing and novel drugs. The technology is designed to support an extended duration of effect and delivery of drugs in a hyper-localized fashion, targeting only the tissues that physicians want to treat. We believe the potential for fewer adverse events may be achieved through the precision targeting and the stable and flat delivery of the active ingredient when using the DiffuSphere™ technology, versus the peaks and troughs seen with more traditional drug delivery methods. The precision of Eupraxia's DiffuSphere™ technology platform has the potential to augment and transform existing FDA-approved drugs to improve their safety, tolerability, efficacy and duration of effect. The potential uses in therapeutic areas may go beyond pain and inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, where Eupraxia currently is developing advanced treatments, also to be applicable in oncology, infectious disease and other critical disease areas.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Eupraxia's EP-104GI is currently in a Phase 1b/2a trial, the RESOLVE trial, for the treatment of EoE. EP-104GI is administered as an injection into the esophageal wall, providing local delivery of drug. This is a unique treatment approach for EoE. Eupraxia also recently completed a Phase 2b clinical trial (SPRINGBOARD) of EP-104IAR for the treatment of pain due to knee osteoarthritis. The trial met its primary endpoint and three of the four secondary endpoints. In addition, Eupraxia is developing a pipeline of later and earlier-stage long-acting formulations. Potential pipeline indications include candidates for other inflammatory joint indications and oncology, each designed to improve on the activity and tolerability of currently approved drugs.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.
