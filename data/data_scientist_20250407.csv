Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams.

Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $180,000 - $270,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Location: Redmond / Remote

Duties/Responsibilities

Job Summary:

We focus on evaluating BizChat quality across various scenarios, such as summarizing content from documents, generating images, and projecting data into graphs. For each scenario, we have a set of concrete user tasks (e.g., ""Could you extract the KPIs from the document and project them into a table?""). We will obtain responses from different versions of AI Assistants. The Applied Scientist (AS) will help us[KM7] [LY8] [YW9] develop an LLM-based labeler that can evaluate the quality of responses given the task.

To achieve this, the AS is expected to combine different methods as appropriate.


For example, one approach is to define the correct answer for a given user task and match the chatbot response to this answer, such as a mathematical task like ""Can you help me sort the following numbers: 67, 111, ..."". The AS can generate these answers by combining results from multiple LLM models.
For creative open-answer questions such as ""Summarize the key points from section 4 in this document,"" the AS can help develop an LLM-based judge to evaluate the quality of the summary. To do so, they are expected to refine the prompt to the LLM judge, guiding the LLM-based judge to score different aspects of the summary based on dimensions such as accuracy, comprehensiveness, and conciseness.


Required Skills/Abilities:


Bachelor's Degree in Statistics, Econometrics, Computer Science, Electrical or Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics, or a related field AND 3+ years of related experience (e.g., statistics, predictive analytics, research).
Experience working on successful applied research projects in industry environments.
Applicants with the following skills would be a plus:
Good coding/engineering skill to build production quality solution.
Applications of Foundation Models
Application of Vision, Audio, and Multimodal Foundation Models
Prompt Tuning
Natural Language Processing
Applied Machine Learning
Data Mining with Language Models
Data Annotation Specialty
Strong English reading comprehension and ability to quickly analyze and interpret complex information or Applied Linguistics background is also a plus.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $136,000 - $230,000 per year.

By clicking “Submit Application”, I understand and agree that Notion and its affiliates and subsidiaries will collect and process my information in accordance with Notion’s Global Recruiting Privacy Policy.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits.

Lila Sciences is a privately held, early-stage technology company pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to transform every aspect of the scientific method. Lila Sciences is backed by Flagship Pioneering, which brings the courage, long-term vision, and resources needed to realize unreasonable results. Join our mission-driven team and contribute to the future of science.

We are leveraging AI across both Life Sciences and Physical Sciences to transform the process of invention and discovery,

At Lila Sciences, we are uniquely cross-functional and collaborative. We are actively reimagining the way teams work together and communicate. Therefore, we seek individuals with an inclusive mindset and a diversity of thought. Our teams thrive in unstructured and creative environments. All voices are heard because we know that experience comes in many forms, skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

The Role

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

Candidates should have experience and/or interest in some or all of:


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


Qualifications:


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


Working at Lila, you would have access to advanced technology in the areas of:


AI experimental design and simulation
Automated custom instrumentation
Generative molecular and material design

We’re in the early innings of our vision and poised to take advantage of the massive opportunity to deploy AI into core workflows throughout the insurance industry


About The Role

We're hiring an Applied Data Scientist to join us onsite in San Francisco. Our product is growing incredibly quickly, generating a massive dataset. But the insurance back office remains mired in manual processes. You'll have the opportunity to capitalize on this by building predictive models and AI-powered tools to transform what's possible for our customers.

Who you are


3+ years experience leveraging data-driven analysis and predictive modeling to drive key business decisions
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases
Contributed to predictive systems in a production environment
Excellent written and verbal communication skills; ability to clearly explain your work and collaborate with stakeholders
Comfortable with handling ambiguity and working in a self-directed manner
Curiosity about different industries and the data + business context within them


Projects you might work on


Leverage the latest models to build agents automating natural language-based workflows
Build a system to orchestrate + optimize the processing of millions of transactions
Analyze the efficacy of a new product launch & recommend + drive product improvements


Our team & philosophy

We’re backed by BOND, Spark Capital, Neo, and Workday, as well as founders/executives from Brex, Asana, Plaid, Applied Intuition, Coalition, and more.

Our team hails from companies like Airbnb, Google, Brex, and LiveRamp and we’re fairly low-profile: focusing the majority of our energy on delivering for customers and building a category-defining company.

We’re hiring predominantly in San Francisco 🌁, as we believe in-person collaboration is strategically important for a company at our stage — both for velocity and company culture.

Benefits


Competitive base salary and generous equity
Generous medical, dental, and vision benefits
401K plan enrollment
Flexible time-off policy
Lunch & dinner every day
Paid parental leave
Company outings and offsites
(and more benefits as we grow!)


Comulate is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture that celebrates authenticity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, protected veteran status, or any other legally protected characteristics.

About Descript

Descript is building a simple, intuitive, fully-powered editing tool for video and audio — an editing tool built for the age of AI. We are a team of 150 — with a proven CEO and the backing of some of the world's greatest investors (OpenAI, Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint Ventures, Spark Capital).

Descript is the special company that's in possession of both product market fit and the raw materials (passionate user community, great product, large market) for growth, but is still early enough that each new employee has a measurable influence on the direction of the company.

We're looking to hire people who are local and able to join us at the office when needed. We're flexible, and you're an adult—we don't expect or mandate that you're in the office every day. But we do believe there are valuable and serendipitous moments of discovery and collaboration that come from working together in person.

Descript is an equal opportunity workplace—we are dedicated to equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status. We believe in actively building a team rich in diverse backgrounds, experiences, and opinions to better allow our employees, products, and community to thrive.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams.

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $180,000 - $270,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location.

At Warner Music Group, we’re a global collective of music makers and music lovers, tech innovators and inspired entrepreneurs, game-changing creatives and passionate team members. Here, we know that each talent makes our collective bolder and brighter. We are guided by four core principles that underpin everything we do across all our diverse businesses:


Music is Everything: Music is our passion, and we can never get enough. Tastes, trends, and tech will change, but great artists and songwriters will always be our driving force.
Global Growth, Local Expertise: Music is a global language. Through communication and collaboration, our success can come from anywhere and translate everywhere.
Innovation and Insight: Pushing the boundaries requires the best information and the boldest imagination. We use both to create the future.
Empowered by People: Like the artists we serve and the music they make, our differences make us stronger. This is a place where every talent can belong and build a career.


WMG is home to a wide range of artists, musicians, and songwriters that fuel our success. That is why we are committed to creating a work environment that actively values, appreciates, and respects everyone. We encourage applications from people with a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences.

Consider a career at WMG and get the best of both worlds – an innovative global music company that retains the creative spirit of a nimble independent.

A little bit about our team:

WMG’s Business Intelligence team (BI) works to influence WMG’s strategy and day-to-day operations by developing thoughtful insights & intelligence from its core business practices. The Data Scientist will work with various departments across Warner Music’s Central Functions, Recorded Music, & Music Publishing Divisions to understand the trends and dynamics that drive the constant evolution of our business. Our goal for this role is to strengthen our analytical power and bring improved rigor to the insights we deliver to our family of labels and operators. We work with partners across the company to establish best practices for breaking artists and sustaining catalog repertoire across consumption platforms, gauge the impact of marketing initiatives and campaigns, and work to understand user behavior around the world.

Your role:

Intelligence is the lifeblood of today’s music business, and in this role you’ll get a chance to apply your creativity and problem-solving skills to help our labels and artists connect with consumers across an array of media and mediums. Because the BI team works closely with departments across the company, the Data Scientist will have the opportunity to see the inner workings and decision-making within a global music company - and the ability to influence those decisions with thoughtful intelligence work. We’re a collaborative team that loves learning new things, sharing ideas, thinking about the future of the music industry – and helping our company get there.

Here you’ll get to:


Lead data science projects from inception to completion on topics such as consumption and revenue forecasts, digital advertising forecasts, global trends analysis, business performance trends, and more.
Apply advanced data analysis and statistical modeling techniques to address complex business challenges. Develop and maintain production-level models, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
Work closely with Business Intelligence, Strategy, Corporate Finance, and operators to understand business needs, and provide actionable insights to a diverse audience across the business.
Proactively identify areas where data science can add value by experimenting with different hypotheses and techniques to improve existing processes and techniques within the BI team.
Utilize advanced tools and frameworks for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
Promote and participate in a culture of continuous learning within the team by providing feedback, sharing knowledge, and mentoring more junior team members.


About you:


Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3-5 years of full-time post-graduation experience in the music, entertainment, sports, or financial services industry. Candidates with a PhD can be considered for this level.
Experience and comfort in working with data from globally-trusted third-party sources like the UN, IMF, OECD, and World Bank.
Demonstrated ability to lead and execute data science projects with minimal supervision.
Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R for data analysis and model development.
Experience with machine learning frameworks and statistical tools.
Strong understanding of SQL and working with large datasets.
Familiarity with data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
Expertise in fundamental data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling techniques.
Ability to quickly learn and adapt to new techniques and technologies.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
Strong problem-solving abilities, with a bias towards action and a proactive approach to identifying opportunities and challenges.


We’d love it if you also had:


Familiarity with the streaming music landscape or other digital media
Experience building analytical products and dashboards within BI software like Tableau or other environments like Streamlit.

The Roku Culture

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The Roku Culture


Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.  Role Overview Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery. Key Responsibilities
Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.  Role Overview Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery. Key Responsibilities
Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.
