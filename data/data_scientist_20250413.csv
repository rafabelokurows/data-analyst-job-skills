We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated.

We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Machine Learning Engineer(d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Why we’re hiring for this role

Montamo is on a mission to revolutionize craftsmanship and solve the skilled labor shortage by building the most efficient installation process on the market. We’ve mastered operations through smart processes and software, and our platform, ""Lubo,"" is already transforming how heat pumps are installed and how tradespeople are trained.

But we’re just getting started. To take our operations, academy, and product to the next level, we need an Analytics Engineer who can build and own Montamo’s data stack from scratch. This role will be pivotal in enabling both in-product analytics for our groundbreaking guided installation platform and internal analytics to drive smarter business decisions across operations, talent development, and customer acquisition.

If you’re excited about shaping the data infrastructure of a fast-growing startup that’s redefining craftsmanship—and want to be part of the next big thing in clean energy solutions—this is your chance.

What you'll do

You'll Own


Building Montamo's data foundation from scratch
Design and implement our data infrastructure including pipelines, warehouse, and governance
Create a unified data model that connects installation metrics, training outcomes, and customer journeys
In-product analytics for Lubo
Develop performance dashboards for technicians and operations teams
Identify user behavior patterns to improve our guided installation platform
Work with product to embed actionable insights directly into the technician experience
Internal analytics for business intelligence
Build leadership dashboards tracking KPIs across operations, academy, and customer acquisition
Transform raw operational data into insights that drive smarter decision-making
Enable data-driven optimization of technician scheduling and supply chain
Scale with pragmatism
Implement lightweight solutions that deliver immediate value while supporting future growth
Continuously evolve our data architecture as Montamo expands into new regions and services

Our developing tech stack & practices

While our AI/data stack is just getting started, you’ll have the freedom to shape it using modern tools:


Data pipeline tools: Airflow or dbt (or your preferred choice!)
Data storage: Postgres (for now), Snowflake or BigQuery (as we scale)
Analytics tools: Looker Studio for dashboards; Python/R for deeper analysis
Event tracking: TBD—you’ll help us decide!


We love pragmatic approaches that focus on delivering value fast without compromising quality. You’ll work closely with our software engineering team building Lubo on Next.js/Node.js/Postgres.

Dein Profil

You’re Our Match If You


Have 2-4 years of experience shipping AI systems and can navigate full-stack development
Get excited about:
Edge cases of deploying vision models on construction sites
Optimizing RAG pipelines for non-English speakers
Building “good enough now, scalable later” solutions
Can answer these cold: “How would you compress a vision model for offline use on low-end Android devices?” “Explain fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering tradeoffs for multilingual support” “Debug a Next.js API route that’s timing out on GPU-heavy inference”
Bonus superpowers


Experience with voice interfaces or IoT sensor integration
German language skills to interact without intermediary your users
Passion for climate tech, craftmenship and/or upskilling workers

Proficiency in Python and SQL with experience using ML frameworks and libraries such as PyTorch and scikit-learn.
Familiarity with the AWS ecosystem.
Experience collaborating with engineering and product teams, with proficiency in version controlling (e.g., Git).
Ability to translate business requirements into quantitative solutions and clearly communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders.
Ability to manage multiple projects in a fast-paced environment.
Experience working with large-scale geospatial and sensor data and familiarity with remote sensing a plus.
Full working proficiency in English. German is a plus.


Benefits:


Opportunity: Be part of our journey from the very beginning, working on an equal footing with the leadership team to build a new company.
Impact: Make a daily and active contribution to combating climate change, promoting consumer education, and fostering fair conditions for our climate-conscious farmers.
Autonomy: Take ownership of your projects and enjoy a high degree of creative freedom.
Competitive package: Receive a competitive salary and have the opportunity to participate in our VSIP program.
Flexible work model: At Klim, we foster a flexible, hybrid work approach and facilitate hybrid/remote work (within Germany). It is advantageous for this role if you live in Berlin or can be present in our office regularly.
Additional benefits: We offer membership in the Urban Sports Club or the Deutschlandticket, team lunches (if in Berlin) and regular team events.


At Klim, we believe that a thriving workplace is built on the diverse backgrounds, talents, and perspectives of our team. We grow stronger together by embracing and building on each individual’s unique strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. All hiring and personnel decisions are made solely based on qualifications, performance, and the needs of the company—ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for all.

If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply. You might be the perfect fit for our team in ways you don’t yet realise!

About Us

Right now, 25% of CO2 emissions in Europe are caused by heating our buildings. In order for this to be reduced, the transition towards renewable energy needs to be simplified and made more accessible. There are too few installers to meet the growing demand for heat pumps, and a solution to match this trend needs to be brought to the market.

autarc is developing the leading operating system (OS) for heat pump installers, enabling a more digital and efficient installation process for heat pumps.

Through this, autarc is reducing the hurdles to decarbonizing single-family homes and small apartment buildings in Europe, with the goal to help with the planning and designing of 1 million heat pumps by 2030.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Staff Machine Learning Research Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics..

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

          <strong>Why us?<br><br></strong>We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.<br><br>Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.<br><br>As a Staff Machine Learning Research Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics..<br><br>This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.<br><br>Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!<br><br>At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.<br><br><strong>Where your expertise is needed <br><br></strong><ul><li>You identify promising new directions based on the scientific literature, results from in-house experiments, and your own novel ideas.</li><li>You are able to turn these ideas into reality by describing, presenting, designing, implementing, and experimenting with novel machine learning architectures, models, and variants of existing models</li><li>You analyze experiments that you and others run, and form ideas and hypotheses to explain results</li><li>You run large-scale distributed machine learning experiments</li><li>You work with the Staff Data Science team and with other teams involved in machine learning and translational research</li><li>You resolve technical difficulties that arise as part of the data science and machine learning work</li><li>You develop ideas about our data science and machine learning strategy, and how this relates to business objectives, so as to provide a competitive advantage</li><li>You develop ideas about product management on technical and scientific feasibility and risks of complex product features</li><li>You contribute to technical and scientific design, planning, and integration of our platform across systems and algorithms</li><li>You provide technical and scientific guidance in data science model, algorithm, and system design reviews</li><li>Educate mid-level and junior ML researchers and data scientists to bring them up to the next level</li><li>Demonstrate long-term thinking and utmost technical and scientific excellence in your individual contributions</li><li>Support data science teams in maintaining up-to-date, high-quality documentation and code<br><br></li></ul><strong>What We Are Looking For<br><br></strong><ul><li>Demonstrated research excellence, as demonstrated by your scientific track record: peer-reviewed publications in relevant journals and at relevant conferences</li><li>Proven track record of driving technical and scientific excellence and innovation </li><li>Expertise in: pathology machine learning, foundation models, and robust medical machine learning models</li><li>Deep understanding of what it means and takes to apply machine learning in the medical domain</li><li>Extensive knowledge and understanding of relevant deep learning models</li><li>Knowledge of the medical and/or biological domain is a highly valuable additional qualification</li><li>Excellent communicative skills, able to articulate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders</li><li>You are a team player who gets enthusiastic when your contributions drive the team ahead</li><li>Extensive experience with designing, setting up, running, monitoring and evaluating (i) large-scale distributed machine learning trainings, (ii) multimodal machine learning, or (iii) robust machine learning products; 6+ years of experience with this</li><li>Advanced degree in Machine Learning, Computer Science, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics, or a related field that provides sufficient technical background to perform state of the art machine learning research</li><li>Extensive experience with machine learning and statistical concepts, including advanced topics such as self-supervised learning, foundation models, representation learning, explainable AI (XAI), multimodal models</li><li>Knowledge and routine application of best practices in software engineering, software architecture, and clean coding</li><li>Solid understanding of cloud technologies (GCP, AWS), containerization and orchestration (Kubernetes, Ray)<br><br></li></ul>Ideally, you also:<br><br><ul><li>Contribute to open-source projects and scientific publications</li><li>Have experience with large scale data processing systems such as Ray, Spark, etc.</li><li>Extensive expertise in multiple programming languages and frameworks is a plus</li><li>Worked in a regulated environment, e.g. financial services, aerospace, or healthcare</li><li>Have knowledge of digital pathology or medical imaging</li><li>Have experience with biomedical data processing and analysis<br><br></li></ul>We are still keen to hear from you if you don't match all the above points!

Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take responsibility and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees.

About Us

Right now, 25% of CO2 emissions in Europe are caused by heating our buildings. In order for this to be reduced, the transition towards renewable energy needs to be simplified and made more accessible. There are too few installers to meet the growing demand for heat pumps, and a solution to match this trend needs to be brought to the market.

autarc is developing the leading operating system (OS) for heat pump installers, enabling a more digital and efficient installation process for heat pumps.

Through this, autarc is reducing the hurdles to decarbonizing single-family homes and small apartment buildings in Europe, with the goal to help with the planning and designing of 1 million heat pumps by 2030.

Recreation of state-of-the-art models from the scientific literature and benchmarking against internal models and evaluations.




Additional / Development Areas

Model deployment to ensure flexible and scalable inference access to the wider Data Science team.
Collaboration with the bioinformatics team to ingest, standardize, and QC data from multiple sources (internal and external) for use in training pipelines.
Support for the wider ML team on model development and commercial projects.




Competencies

Core

Postgraduate experience (MSc or PhD) in ML with a demonstrated application to a biological domain.
Experience building modern ML architectures (e.g., transformers, diffusers) from scratch and applying them to real biological datasets.
Experience working with large-scale transcriptomic datasets, ideally from non-human organisms (though not required).
Experience with PyTorch, huggingface transformers, and diffusers.
Experience working with ML accelerators.




Nice-to-have

Relevant publications in reputable journals or contributions to open-source projects.
Exposure to and interest in probabilistic ML, causal ML, or active learning.
Experience with distributed model training (data and model parallelism).
Experience working on biological data curation, including data cleansing and preprocessing of -omics datasets.
Exposure to cloud-based ML orchestration frameworks such as Sagemaker and Vertex AI.
Experience with model deployment in an enterprise setting.




Benefits

Competitive salary and equity options.
25 days of annual leave and the option for a 2-week ""work from anywhere"" policy.
Comprehensive benefits package.
Career development opportunities as the company grows.

About the Role

This is a newly created role for our first Data Scientist to join our wider Evidence Development team, where you will have responsibility for shaping and driving forward our Data Science service offering to clients.

This role will be cross-functional, working predominantly with our Statistics, Literature Reviews, Technical Innovation and Development (TechDev) and Real-World Evidence (RWE) teams on a variety of project types. As the only Data Scientist at the company, you will be responsible for applying your expertise to our projects to suggest data science solutions to business problems.

Your key responsibilities will include:


Leading Data Science Initiatives:
Setup and implementation of data science techniques across various business applications
Expanding Service Offerings:
Use machine learning to explore and develop new types of projects for our clients
Introduce new methods for evidence synthesis using AI
Support with data processing on RWE projects, which utilise data from a variety of sources (EHR, disease registries, claim databases etc.)

Hybrid Working Policy: We believe that having face-to-face time in the office holds many benefits and is central to ensuring that the community we have created, where people have a workplace they belong to and feel part of, is never lost.

Therefore, we offer flexible working arrangements that allow our colleagues who have passed probation to work from home for up to half of the time, measured across a 2-week rolling period. During your probationary period (normally the first 6 months of the role) you will be able to work from home for 1 day per week.

Today, Gusto offices in Denver, San Francisco, and New York serve more than 400,000 businesses nationwide.

Our mission is to create a world where work empowers a better life, and it starts right here at Gusto. That’s why we’re committed to building a collaborative and inclusive workplace, both physically and virtually. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy.

Gusto is looking for a Principal Applied AI Scientist to join our AI team and build out our Generative AI capabilities.

About The Role

We’re looking to accelerate AI investments across the business to solve customer pain points, and are growing our Applied AI team. You’ll be a part of the core group of experts exploring big, innovative bets, quickly prototyping solutions and shipping to customers. You're also responsible for quickly iterating on improvements and eventually scaling to production-grade AI applications. You’ll be working alongside a multidisciplinary group of Product Engineers, PMs, and Design.

In this role, you’ll be responsible for designing, building, evaluating, and shipping products that use proprietary and open source LLMs. You’ll be responsible for all aspects of the AI development lifecycle: framing the problem, designing the system, making decisions on frameworks, building, evaluation, and deploying. As an Applied AI Scientist, you’ll own the customer impact end-to-end.

Here’s What You’ll Do Day-to-day


Design, develop and deploy innovative AI solutions
Experiment with multi-agent frameworks to build autonomous systems
Improve LLMs through pre-training, fine-turning, and RLHF
Build evaluation for LLMs and LLM based products, and assess best methods required to build LLMs suited for purpose
Collaborate with the engineering team to determine technical requirements and SLAs for API-enabled services
Research novel AI techniques and strategies that create magical customer experiences


Here’s What We're Looking For


8+ years experience designing, evaluating, and productionizing AI applications.
Experience with Agentic AI frameworks (LangGraph and Llama-Index) and experience building, deploying and maintaining LLM-based applications in production are essential
Demonstrated expertise in writing production-level Python code
Proven ability to design and prototype AI solutions quickly
Experience working on multi-agent AI systems to automate end to end workflows

Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $191,000-$237,000/year in Denver, Chicago, and Atlanta, $208,000-$258,000/year in Los Angeles and Seattle, and $225,000-$279,000/year for San Francisco and New York. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.

Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale.

Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas.

When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Gusto.

Gusto is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Gusto considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Gusto is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures.

Your models don’t just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you —read on.

AlgaeCal is looking for a top-tier Data Scientist Intern who can turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.




This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we’re driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world’s only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you’ll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.




This job might be for you if you’ve got…

Experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You’ve built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don’t just analyze numbers—you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You’ve used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities.
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that’ll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it’s regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don’t just apply models—you understand how they work under the hood.
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics.
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You’ve worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization.
Familiarity with AI and deep learning principles. You know how artificial intelligence models (including RAG) can be adapted to automate and optimize business tasks. You’ve explored the potential of AI beyond just theory.
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You’re the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point.
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don’t just crunch numbers—you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You’re proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability.
Industry know-how that adds value. If you’ve got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that’s a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI.




Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you’re nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can’t wait to meet you.




Other Qualities You’ll Need

At AlgaeCal we’re going to insist that you have these 3 qualities:

You’re humble––you put the team and others’ needs ahead of your own
You’re hungry to learn more
You’re people smart––in the sense that you’re a great teammate

The truth is, if you don’t have these qualities you won’t last long at AlgaeCal. So if you’re missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.




What Will You Earn?

We believe in rewarding top talent. Let’s talk about salary once we’ve had the chance to get to know you better. Rest assured, we’re generous and offer above-market pay for the right person. If you bring the skills and experience, we’ll make sure the compensation reflects that.




You’ll also enjoy the following benefits:

Monthly team events and activities
Flexible Stat Holidays with the option to bank days for later use
Weekly team lunches
Casual dress code
Incredible dog friendly, Yaletown office one block from SkyTrain
Remote working is okay with us too.

And above all, you’ll join a team that you’ll never want to leave. Culture is everything to us. Yes, we work extremely hard to change as many people’s lives as possible. But we know how to have fun and reward ourselves too.

Write test plans to validate Arista features and products.
Design test network topologies to validate functionality, performance, stability and scalability of features and products.
Execute test plans to verify all aspects of the product. Identify defects and validate resolution.
Work as an agile member of a combined development and test team, running in short cycles to develop functional software in quick iterations.
Work with the developers in creating their plans for automated tests to complement the exploratory testing that you perform. Be the testing expert for your team.
Participate in functional specification and software design reviews held by the development team and provide customer centric input.


Qualifications


BS CS/CE/EE plus 3+ years of experience in networking. MS degree preferred
A minimum of one year of hands-on experience testing SONiC is a must (manual testing experience strongly desired).
Strong working knowledge of SONiC architecture - SAI, FRR open routing stack (formerly Quagga, Zebra), Redis-DB, docker and minigraph
Hands on experience with Linux operating system and its associated technologies (e.g. Virtualization, Kubernetes & more)
Strong knowledge in one or more of the following areas: Ethernet, RSTP/ MSTP, VLANs, IP Routing, TCP/IP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, IGMP, PIM SM/ SSM, QoS, L2-L3 protocols, Platform validation, HA, QOS, network management.
Knowledge of forwarding ASICs, FPGAs and network processors highly desired
Proven expertise in creating test methodologies and writing test plans.
Experience with IXIA and/or Spirent test tools desired
Familiarity with test automation tools and scripting languages desired
Strong communication skills.


ACE/CCIE/JNCIE certifications are a plus.
