We aim to achieve this by cultivating a work environment where all team members belong and have the opportunity to thrive.

Lyft connects people to transportation to change the way we live and get around our communities. Lyft’s engineering team is growing rapidly, and we are looking for Software Engineers with a passion in Security to help us scale. Come be part of the Security team at Lyft focused on enabling and empowering engineering teams to deliver secure services at scale.

Our drivers and passengers entrust Lyft with their personal information and travel details to get where they're going and expect us to keep that data safe. Lyft's security team leads efforts across the company to ensure our systems are secure and worthy of our users' trust.

The security team designs and builds Lyft's security architecture, consults with other teams as they build and launch new products and features, proactively plans for the unexpected, and responds to incidents that occur. Our work affects the entire company and takes place at all levels of the stack, from infrastructure to web application security, as well as mobile apps, IT, and autonomous vehicles. We try to approach security from a software engineering standpoint. We believe in scaling security through automation and tooling and we ship frequently. Check out our blog posts at https://eng.lyft.com/tagged/security to learn more about some of the things we’ve built.

We're looking for an engineer who's excited about growing and improving security at Lyft by building systems and promoting security throughout the company. You'll play a part in shaping the future of security at Lyft, and your work will have significant impact and visibility.

Responsibilities:


Architect and build services that improve the security of our systems with an eye towards scalability and avoiding unnecessary friction.
Evangelize our shared security responsibility model by collaborating with other Infrastructure teams at Lyft to ensure that our services and workflows are secure by default.
Work on embedding security best practices such as least privilege, isolation, monitoring, authentication and authorization across our infrastructure
Develop critical services that Lyft depends on such as our credential management service that provides secrets to all our services at Lyft.
Provide rich data to engineers at Lyft to drive manual and automated decision making by working on our open-source service Cartography, which shows relationships between our infrastructure assets.
Ensuring least privilege is enforced by improving role-based access control and Identity Access Management for our users and services


Experience:


Solid experience with a high level programming language (bonus points for experience with Python, Go-lang and shell scripts)
Experience with (or a deep interest in) computer security
When facing a problem that's poorly defined or outside of your expertise, you can quickly learn what you need to dig in, make sense of the problem, and start working towards a solution
You're a great communicator, and can advocate for your proposals while also empathizing with your teammates' goals and priorities
You understand that security work must be prioritized because all teams have finite resources. You have good judgment and a sense of when to compromise and when to hold your ground
Understanding of computer network security or major computer networking protocols (e.g. TCP/IP, HTTP, TLS, DNS).
Nice to haves:
Experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) or any other major cloud service provider
Kubernetes and container security and running fleets of endpoints or servers in the cloud.
Cryptography, PKI, or key distribution
Running multi-tier or distributed web applications at scale

Benefits:


Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options with additional programs available when enrolled
Mental health benefits
Family building benefits
Child care and pet benefits
401(k) plan to help save for your future
In addition to 12 observed holidays, salaried team members have discretionary paid time off, hourly team members have 15 days paid time off
18 weeks of paid parental leave. Biological, adoptive, and foster parents are all eligible
Subsidized commuter benefits

We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions.

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $180,000 - $270,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location.

Lazarus Naturals was founded in 2016 to provide safe and accessible CBD products for everyone who would benefit from them, regardless of their financial situation and ability to pay, which is why we provide a 60% Assistance Program to veterans and people with disabilities or low-incomes.

Cycling Frog is normalizing the consumption of casual use THC products. We are on a mission to make THC convenient, affordable, and fun by making a sessionable THC beverage the same price as a beer or soda. We want to change the way THC is consumed and viewed by our society by focusing on lower potency, ready to drink beverages that can easily fit into anyone's lifestyle. Under the Federal Farm Bill it is legal to sell these low potency THC products across all 50 states via the internet, and anywhere you can grab a beer.

Summary: This JD pertains to an R&D Scientist with a background in product and process development to support our Seattle office.

Beyond technical qualifications and sufficient experience requirements, we at Etz Hayim look for people who can thrive in our work environment and actively challenge themselves. We prioritize applicants who can illustrate their capacity to think critically, approach problem solving positively and constructively, as well as the ability to claim responsibility for their actions, whether good or bad.

Moreover, we prefer applicants who share our passion and pride in the work we all contribute to as a team.

Lazarus Naturals was founded in 2016 to provide safe and accessible CBD products for everyone who would benefit from them, regardless of their financial situation and ability to pay, which is why we provide a 60% Assistance Program to veterans and people with disabilities or low-incomes.

Summary: This JD pertains to an R&D Scientist with a background in product and process development to support our Seattle office. The candidate should have a strong grounding in scientific principles, and a demonstrated track record of developing products and processes from proof of concept through scale up, validation, and implementation. Beyond technical qualifications and sufficient experience requirements, we at Etz Hayim look for people who can thrive in our work environment and actively challenge themselves. We prioritize applicants who can illustrate their capacity to think critically, approach problem solving positively and constructively, as well as the ability to claim responsibility for their actions, whether good or bad. It is equally important that any applicant is able to exhibit an appreciation for proactive honesty and marked flexibility in the face of abrupt change. Moreover, we prefer applicants who share our passion and pride in the work we all contribute to as a team.

The advent of big data heralds a new era of precision healthcare, where medicine is tailored to individuals, reducing cost, suffering, and missed treatment opportunities. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a key role in this transformation by discerning knowledge from data and separating signal from noise.

We aspire to advance AI toward developing health systems that can instantly incorporate any new information to optimize delivery and accelerate discovery. A key bottleneck is that current health systems are mired in overwhelming unstructured data and non-scalable manual processing. Recent advances in generative AI, such as large language models (LLMs), offer unprecedented “universal structuring” capabilities that can supercharge health information processing and unlock many high-value applications in real-world evidence and precision health.

Microsoft Research's Health Futures is an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and medical doctors who endeavor to develop next-generation AI for precision healthcare. We offer a unique vibrant environment that features cutting-edge academic research, enterprise software development, and real-world delivery, with close feedback loops and rapid iterations among all three, much like a lean startup.

We are looking for an innovative, collaborative Research Intern to join our efforts at the intersection of AI and healthcare, where we partner with premier medical centers and develop state-of-the-art deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and multi-modal technologies to extract knowledge from tens of millions of research publications, distill patient information from hundreds of millions of electronic health records (EHRs), and assimilate them with billions of genomics data points to support biomedical research and clinical decision making.

We work together to give everyone the power to share their story, explore what they love, and connect with one another in the process. Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun — and we do it all together.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $141,000-$202,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

We aim to achieve this by cultivating a work environment where all team members belong and have the opportunity to thrive.

Lyft connects people to transportation to change the way we live and get around our communities. Lyft’s engineering team is growing rapidly, and we are looking for Software Engineers with a passion in Security to help us scale. Come be part of the Security team at Lyft focused on enabling and empowering engineering teams to deliver secure services at scale.

Our drivers and passengers entrust Lyft with their personal information and travel details to get where they're going and expect us to keep that data safe. Lyft's security team leads efforts across the company to ensure our systems are secure and worthy of our users' trust.

The security team designs and builds Lyft's security architecture, consults with other teams as they build and launch new products and features, proactively plans for the unexpected, and responds to incidents that occur. Our work affects the entire company and takes place at all levels of the stack, from infrastructure to web application security, as well as mobile apps, IT, and autonomous vehicles. We try to approach security from a software engineering standpoint. We believe in scaling security through automation and tooling and we ship frequently. Check out our blog posts at https://eng.lyft.com/tagged/security to learn more about some of the things we’ve built.

We're looking for an engineer who's excited about growing and improving security at Lyft by building systems and promoting security throughout the company. You'll play a part in shaping the future of security at Lyft, and your work will have significant impact and visibility.

Responsibilities:


Architect and build services that improve the security of our systems with an eye towards scalability and avoiding unnecessary friction.
Evangelize our shared security responsibility model by collaborating with other Infrastructure teams at Lyft to ensure that our services and workflows are secure by default.
Work on embedding security best practices such as least privilege, isolation, monitoring, authentication and authorization across our infrastructure

When facing a problem that's poorly defined or outside of your expertise, you can quickly learn what you need to dig in, make sense of the problem, and start working towards a solution
You're a great communicator, and can advocate for your proposals while also empathizing with your teammates' goals and priorities
You understand that security work must be prioritized because all teams have finite resources. You have good judgment and a sense of when to compromise and when to hold your ground
Understanding of computer network security or major computer networking protocols (e.g. TCP/IP, HTTP, TLS, DNS).
Nice to haves:
Experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) or any other major cloud service provider
Kubernetes and container security and running fleets of endpoints or servers in the cloud.
Cryptography, PKI, or key distribution

The Role

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

Candidates should have experience and/or interest in some or all of:


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


Qualifications:


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


Working at Lila, you would have access to advanced technology in the areas of:


AI experimental design and simulation
Automated custom instrumentation
Generative molecular and material design

OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We believe that achieving our goal requires real world deployment and iteratively updating based on what we learn.

The Intelligence and Investigations team supports this by identifying and investigating misuses of our products – especially new types of abuse. This enables our partner teams to develop data-backed product policies and build scaled safety mitigations. Precisely understanding abuse allows us to safely enable users to build useful things with our products.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist on the Monitoring Operations team, you will be responsible for building systems to proactively identify abuse on OpenAI’s products. This includes ensuring we have robust monitoring in place for new products, and can sustain monitoring for existing products. You will also respond to critical escalations, especially those that are not caught by our existing safety systems. This will require expert understanding of our products and data, and involves working cross-functionally with product, policy, and engineering teams.

This role will be based in our San Francisco office and includes participation in an on-call rotation that will involve resolving urgent escalations outside of normal work hours. Some investigations may involve sensitive content, including sexual, violent, or otherwise-disturbing material.

In This Role, You Will


Scope and implement monitoring requirements for new product launches. This involves working with Product and Policy teams to understand key risks, and working with Engineering teams to ensure we have sufficient data and tooling.
Improve processes to sustain monitoring operations for existing products. This includes developing approaches to automate monitoring subtasks.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


Have at least 4 years of experience doing technical analysis, especially in SQL and Python.
Have experience in trust and safety and/or have worked closely with policy, enforcement, and engineering teams
Have experience with basic data engineering, such as building core tables or writing data pipelines (not expected to build infrastructure or write production code)
Have experience scaling and automating processes, especially with language models

Support pricing and limit-setting strategies through quantitative analysis of risk-adjusted returns.
Design and evaluate tests to policy changes to measure the impact of credit risk strategies on financial performance.


Requirements


Master’s degree or Ph.D. in Statistics, Economics, Finance, Computer Science, or a related quantitative field.
3+ years of experience in credit risk analytics, underwriting strategy, or related data science roles in lending or financial services.
Strong experience with SQL and Python (or R) for data analysis and modeling.
Proficiency in credit risk modeling techniques, including logistic regression, scorecard development, and loss forecasting.
Familiarity with credit bureau data, alternative data sources, and regulatory risk considerations.
Ability to synthesize complex analyses into actionable business insights and communicate findings to stakeholders.
Experience with experimentation and causal inference methodologies.


Bonus Points


Experience working in B2B SaaS or fintech, particularly in a lending environment.
Familiarity with risk-based pricing models and financial modeling techniques.
Experience working with credit decisioning systems and automated underwriting workflows.
Knowledge of regulatory frameworks such as CECL, Basel II/III, or stress testing methodologies.


This role offers a unique opportunity to shape the future of credit risk strategy at Brex while working with a world-class data and risk management team. If you are passionate about using data science to drive better lending decisions, we’d love to hear from you!

About The Job

The premium experience for YouTube users involves no ads, backgrounding, downloads (for offline experiences), and many others. The role focuses on understanding and quantifying user behavior that violates the YouTube Premium terms-of-service (ToS). Several streaming services have been cracking down on abuse, and in some cases have seen growth in legit accounts following the crackdown. On YouTube Premium, there are several aspects to premium abuse: creator payout abuse, family plan and cross-border abuse and google account sharing. Each involves developing signals, methods and models that will be used to identify cases where there is a high probability of ToS violations. Further, this analyst will help develop processes for and support enforcement.

At YouTube, we believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share, and build community through our stories. We work together to give everyone the power to share their story, explore what they love, and connect with one another in the process. Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun — and we do it all together.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $141,000-$202,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process.

As a Data Scientist at Kikoff, you work closely with cross functional teams incl. Product, Engineering, Data Engineering, Marketing, Operation. By applying your technical skills, analytical mindset, and product intuition, you will help our customers improve their financial security. You will use data to identify and solve product development’s biggest challenges. Your responsibilities includes:


Product leadership: use data to shape product development, quantify new opportunities, set goals, identify upcoming challenges, and ensure the products we build bring value to our customers.
Analytics: develop hypotheses and employ a diverse toolkit of rigorous analytical approaches, different methodologies, frameworks, and technical approaches to test them.
Communication and influence: convince and influence your partners by telling clear data stories.


Qualifications


Bachelors’ or above in quantitative discipline: Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Engineering, or related field
A minimum of 2 years of work experience in analytics
Expert knowledge of SQL and experience with Python
Deep understanding of statistical analysis, experimentation design, and common analytical techniques like regression, decision trees
Strong verbal and written communication skills
A humble collaborative can-do attitude and natural curiosity


What We’re Like


Scrappy. We had a product goal and put out the MVP, collecting our first users with steady growth via paid channels in four months. We don’t cut corners when we know we’ll need them but we don’t build things without that need. We don’t like inefficiency but we dislike operationalizing one-off tasks even more.
Risk-oriented. Everything has risk, but a mature team knows how to make these tradeoffs. That’s why we built the MVP fast––because time is your most valuable asset and is practically fungible with money in the startup world.
Data-obsessed. We all look at data and pull it, and we believe that understanding the mechanics can yield valuable insights. Complex systems require elegant, not just simple solutions. You absolutely need to be interested in data if you want to leverage your knowledge of systems.
Lucky. That’s how we look at this journey so far. From our timing of fundraising, to the circumstances in which we came together, to the initial product traction we’re getting, there’s no other word to describe it. We are grateful you are reading this, and we know that if you’re meant to be with us on this journey, then we will see you soon.

Experience with image processing, signal processing, or frequency-domain analysis
Prior startup experience







This role will be located in Lumafield’s Boston office. You may be required to travel occasionally to Lumafield’s San Francisco office, depending on local, state and federal regulations and recommendations pertaining to COVID-19.

Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as health and wellness, 401k, parental, vacation, commuter benefits, and more.

Key job responsibilities

We Are Seeking An Enthusiastic Data Scientist To


Design and implement state-of-the-art solutions for never-before-solved problems.
Collaborate closely with other research and robotics experts to design and run experiments, research new algorithms, and find new ways to improve Amazon Robotics analytics to optimize the Customer experience.
Partner with technology and product leaders to solve business problems using scientific approaches.
Build new tools and invent business insights that surprise and delight our customers.
Work to quantify system performance at scale, and to expand the breadth and depth of our analysis to increase the ability of software components and warehouse processes.
Work to evolve our library of key performance indicators and construct experiments that efficiently root cause emergent behaviors.
Engage with software development teams and warehouse design engineers to drive the evolution of the Amazon Robotics system, as well as the simulation engine that supports our work.


A day in the life

As a member of the Software Research and Data Science (SWRDS) team, there are multiple different paths you can take. For example, you may conduct deep dive analysis of both structured and unstructured robotics field analyses. Some of our team members focus on modeling, pipelines and tooling work, while others focus more on analytic work. We also have team members working on early-concept solution analysis (leveraging simulations, ML-based models, experimenting with new solutions).

About The Team

The Amazon Robotics Software Research and Data Science (SWRDS) team builds and runs simulation experiments and delivers analyses that are central to understanding the performance of the entire Amazon Robotics system. This includes operational and software scaling characteristics, bottlenecks, and robustness to “chaos monkey” stresses -- we inform critical engineering and business decisions about Amazon’s approach to robotic fulfillment.
