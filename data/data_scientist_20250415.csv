We are developing a next-gen integration platform that allows SaaS businesses of any size to integrate their product with third-party products in a fast, powerful, and secure way.

üéñÔ∏è Our vision

The number of SaaS companies is exploding. But making great integrations is still too expensive and slow. We are building StackOne to solve this and become the platform that powers a connected ecosystem of apps that customers love.

üí™ Well-funded and backed by top-tier angels and VCs, we're now growing extremely rapidly and we are currently raising a multi-million dollar round. We're seeking talented and driven individuals who can help us achieve our vision and continue to grow the product and the overall company at a record pace.

About The Role

We are looking for a Software Engineer or Data/AI Scientist with a strong background in AI production-grade applications with strong experience with LLM models (eg: GPT, Anthropic and others).

In this role, you will conduct research and development around AI, focusing on automating processes and development at StackOne. We're building a world where users of any SaaS can integrate with the tool of their choice in one click thanks to StackOne. We're convinced AI is pivotal to making this a reality by transforming how SaaS talks to each other and this is what you will help achieve.

Responsibilities


Research, design, and develop AI models using or training existing or bespoke LLM models (and other AI tech) to improve and automate API & more generally SaaS interactions.
Managing and updating Data pipelines used for AI use-cases
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify opportunities for AI integration and automation
Optimize and refine existing AI models and applications for performance and scalability
Stay current with advancements in AI and LLM technologies, applying new knowledge to StackOne's AI strategy
Implement best practices in AI development, ensuring compliance with data privacy and security regulations
Document and communicate research findings and development progress to stakeholders
Collaborate with other software & AI engineer(s) to deliver larger scale projects


Requirements


Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field (or 3+ years of relevant experience)
Familiarity with API development, integration, and SaaS platforms
Past experience with AI, specifically Large Language Models and related technologies
Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills
Strong communication and collaboration abilities
Desire to work in a fast-paced, dynamic startup environment


Preferable


You‚Äôre familiar with Typescript
You‚Äôve deployed or managed infrastructure on AWS


‚ö°Ô∏è Our Stack

You Will Have a Lot Of Freedom And Agency To Chose And Work With The Technologies You Love. Our Tech Stack Includes


Infra & monitoring: AWS (ECS, RDS, Elasticache, Lambda etc.), Tinybird, Modal, Dagster, Langsmith, Datadog, Sentry, Incident.io
Languages & Frameworks: Typescript (Node.js), NestJS, Rails, React, Svelte,
Other day-to-day Tools: Postman, Notion, Slack, Jira, Github and more


üöÄ Product

StackOne is one of the fastest-growing embedded integration platforms. Here‚Äôs why:


It drives down the cost of building integrations by 10x. To add dozens of integrations, you only need to integrate once with our unified API and we take care of the rest. This is way faster, cheaper, and more reliable than building every integration to each tool one at a time (it can take weeks/months per integration).
It has a superior architecture: Unlike other Unified APIs, we developed an innovative, fully real-time architecture that does not store their customers‚Äô sensitive data by default. This enables our customers to differentiate themselves on the market with better integrations: better for privacy, better for their product‚Äôs user experience, and deeper read/write integrations.
StackOne is a better long-term partner: We are the only integration platform to guarantee new integrations as standard, that offers so many sandboxes to support testing and deploying faster, and that has built a strong partnership ecosystem to enable our customers to develop stronger commercial partnerships.


üòé Why join us?


Join one of Europe‚Äôs fastest-growing startups
Work with a veteran team of ex-employees of Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Coinbase, JP Morgan and more
Participation in the company‚Äôs employee share options plan
25 days holiday + 1 additional day holiday per year of tenure
Flexible work setup - we're hybrid-friendly
¬£1,000 for your home office set up + ¬£500/year top-up
Cycle2Work and Electric Cars scheme
Private health insurance (including dental & optical)
Health, fitness and gift card discounts
Annual team offsite to sunny spots (last ones were in Spain and Portugal ‚òÄÔ∏è)

We believe diversity drives innovation. We encourage individuals from all backgrounds to apply. As an equal-opportunity employer, we celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Summary

ABOUT SAINT LAURENT Founded in 1961, Yves Saint Laurent was the first couture house to introduce the concept of luxury pr√™t-√†-porter in a 1966 collection called ‚ÄòRive Gauche‚Äô, synonymous with youth and freedom. This shift represented a first critical step in the modernization of fashion and revolutionized the sociocultural landscape. In 1999, the luxury goods division of the Kering Group acquired Yves Saint Laurent and, under the creative direction of Anthony Vaccarello since April 2016, continues to position the house at the summit of the luxury universe. Today, Saint Laurent collections include women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs ready-to-wear, shoes, handbags, small leather goods, jewelry, scarves, ties and eyewear.

We are looking for passionate and driven PhD students who have an industry internship as a funded component of their doctoral program and are interested in exploring life at a dynamic biotechnology start-up. These are fully immersive, on-site placements at our London office and laboratories and last a minimum of three months.




In this role, you will explore and apply DNA large language models at Bactobio. Working with microbiological DNA sequencing data and state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., DNABERT, Nucleotide Transformer), you‚Äôll have the freedom to experiment with various datasets, methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Ultimately, you‚Äôll shape the project‚Äôs direction, with opportunities to focus on areas such as model fine-tuning, the development of benchmarking tools and approaches, embedding investigation, and multimodal modelling.




Please share your expertise in these and related areas, including relevant software, programming languages, libraries, and frameworks. Ideal candidates will have deep learning experience, programming skills, and at least a basic understanding of molecular biology or genetics.




Our previous interns come from a range of programmes, including PIPS, iCASE, and MRC LID. Read about recent internship experiences on our website.

Our first A.I.-powered solution optimizes ordering, forecasting, and store operations for fresh food departments in brick-and-mortar grocers. With our Fresh Operating System, regional and national grocery retailers have placed $1.6 billion in produce orders across the US and we've helped our partners prevent 34 million pounds of food from going to waste. Working at Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by leveraging uncommonly impactful software ‚Äì we hope you'll join us!

About The Role

Afresh builds replenishment technology using AI models that are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies. Our team has presented work at multiple industry leading conferences, and we encourage team members to write and present their work publicly.

As an Applied Scientist at Afresh focused on inventory, you will take your existing knowledge of machine learning, operations research, or statistics and apply it to the challenge of inventory estimation for perishables. You will thrive in this role if you love to work on applied, open-ended problems in research and production environments: thorough error analysis, deep understanding of the data you are modeling, feature selection, algorithm implementation, hyperparameter optimization, deployment, and production modeling. We are looking for someone who is equally adept at gaining insights from 8 hours of data analysis or 8 hours of reading papers.

You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core inventory system. This will include modeling inventory counts provided by our users, incoming shipments, sales, and outflow due to spoilage. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.



You will work on improving the accuracy and calibration of our probabilistic inventory models that power our store-level ordering products. You will also drive research development for new product and business challenges.
In your first 3 months, you will acquire a comprehensive understanding of our current inventory system and modern computational approaches to large scale simulation. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and estimation, and you‚Äôll test an experimental improvement to our inventory system.
By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to either inventory estimation, inventory count targeting, or food waste measurement.
By the end of your first year, you will have launched fundamental changes to our core inventory system and led research into extensions like anytime inventory estimation.
We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof.



Skills And Experience



4+ years of industrial or academic experience building mission-critical applied systems.
Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English.
4+ years of experience with Python libraries like Pytorch, Sklearn and Ray.
Fluent in programmatic data analysis using SQL and Pandas.
Excellent data visualization skills.

Working at Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by leveraging uncommonly impactful software ‚Äì we hope you'll join us!<br><br><strong>About The Role<br><br></strong>Afresh builds replenishment technology using AI models that are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies. Our team has presented work at multiple industry leading conferences, and we encourage team members to write and present their work publicly.<br><br>As an Applied Scientist at Afresh focused on inventory, you will take your existing knowledge of machine learning, operations research, or statistics and apply it to the challenge of inventory estimation for perishables. You will thrive in this role if you love to work on applied, open-ended problems in research and production environments: thorough error analysis, deep understanding of the data you are modeling, feature selection, algorithm implementation, hyperparameter optimization, deployment, and production modeling. We are looking for someone who is equally adept at gaining insights from 8 hours of data analysis or 8 hours of reading papers.<br><br>You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core inventory system. This will include modeling inventory counts provided by our users, incoming shipments, sales, and outflow due to spoilage. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.<br><br><br><ul><li>You will work on improving the accuracy and calibration of our probabilistic inventory models that power our store-level ordering products. You will also drive research development for new product and business challenges.</li><li>In your first 3 months, you will acquire a comprehensive understanding of our current inventory system and modern computational approaches to large scale simulation. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and estimation, and you‚Äôll test an experimental improvement to our inventory system.</li><li>By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to either inventory estimation, inventory count targeting, or food waste measurement.</li><li>By the end of your first year, you will have launched fundamental changes to our core inventory system and led research into extensions like anytime inventory estimation.</li><li>We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof.<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Skills And Experience<br><br><br></strong><ul><li>4+ years of industrial or academic experience building mission-critical applied systems.</li><li>Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English.</li><li>4+ years of experience with Python libraries like Pytorch, Sklearn and Ray.</li><li>Fluent in programmatic data analysis using SQL and Pandas.</li><li>Excellent data visualization skills.<br><br><br></li></ul>Pay Bands in USD:<br><br>Pay Bands in CAN:<br><br><strong>About Afresh<br><br></strong>Founded in 2017, Afresh is working on the #1 solution to curb climate change: reducing food waste. By combining human insight and transformative technology, we're helping grocers provide fresher food to customers at more affordable prices.<br><br>Afresh sits at an incredible intersection of positive social impact, rocket ship financial growth, and cutting-edge technology. Our best-in-class AI research has been published in top journals including ICML, and we've raised over $148 million in funding from investors including former co-CEO of Whole Foods Market Walter Robb and Eric Schmidt's Innovation Endeavors.<br><br>Fresh is the past, present, and future of our food system ‚Äì the waste we create today will impact our planet for years to come.

Our first A.I.-powered solution optimizes ordering, forecasting, and store operations for fresh food departments in brick-and-mortar grocers. With our Fresh Operating System, regional and national grocery retailers have placed $1.6 billion in produce orders across the US and we've helped our partners prevent 34 million pounds of food from going to waste. Working at Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by leveraging uncommonly impactful software ‚Äì we hope you'll join us!

About The Role

Afresh builds replenishment technology using AI models that are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies. Our team has presented work at multiple industry leading conferences, and we encourage team members to write and present their work publicly.

As an Applied Scientist at Afresh focused on inventory, you will take your existing knowledge of machine learning, operations research, or statistics and apply it to the challenge of inventory estimation for perishables. You will thrive in this role if you love to work on applied, open-ended problems in research and production environments: thorough error analysis, deep understanding of the data you are modeling, feature selection, algorithm implementation, hyperparameter optimization, deployment, and production modeling. We are looking for someone who is equally adept at gaining insights from 8 hours of data analysis or 8 hours of reading papers.

You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core inventory system. This will include modeling inventory counts provided by our users, incoming shipments, sales, and outflow due to spoilage. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.



You will work on improving the accuracy and calibration of our probabilistic inventory models that power our store-level ordering products. You will also drive research development for new product and business challenges.
In your first 3 months, you will acquire a comprehensive understanding of our current inventory system and modern computational approaches to large scale simulation. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and estimation, and you‚Äôll test an experimental improvement to our inventory system.
By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to either inventory estimation, inventory count targeting, or food waste measurement.
By the end of your first year, you will have launched fundamental changes to our core inventory system and led research into extensions like anytime inventory estimation.
We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof.



Skills And Experience



4+ years of industrial or academic experience building mission-critical applied systems.
Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English.
4+ years of experience with Python libraries like Pytorch, Sklearn and Ray.
Fluent in programmatic data analysis using SQL and Pandas.
Excellent data visualization skills.

Your models don‚Äôt just sit on a shelf‚Äîthey shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you ‚Äîread on.

AlgaeCal is looking for a top-tier Data Scientist Intern who can turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.




This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we‚Äôre driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

This job might be for you if you‚Äôve got‚Ä¶

Experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You‚Äôve built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don‚Äôt just analyze numbers‚Äîyou translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You‚Äôve used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities.
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that‚Äôll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it‚Äôs regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don‚Äôt just apply models‚Äîyou understand how they work under the hood.
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics.
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You‚Äôve worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization.

A laser-sharp eye for detail. You‚Äôre the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point.
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don‚Äôt just crunch numbers‚Äîyou think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You‚Äôre proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability.
Industry know-how that adds value. If you‚Äôve got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that‚Äôs a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI.




Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you‚Äôre nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can‚Äôt wait to meet you.
