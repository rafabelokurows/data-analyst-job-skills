Lazarus Naturals was founded in 2016 to provide safe and accessible CBD products for everyone who would benefit from them, regardless of their financial situation and ability to pay, which is why we provide a 60% Assistance Program to veterans and people with disabilities or low-incomes.

Moreover, we prefer applicants who share our passion and pride in the work we all contribute to as a team.

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Staff and Senior level Machine Learning Engineers to craft and implement features, services, API methods, and models to leverage our data to make Slack a fabulous, robust, safe, and valuable product for our users. We work on applications across summarization, recommendation, ranking, and security, but ultimately are looking for engineers who can help drive impact with machine learning across the organization.

At Slack, Your Impact Can Be Huge


We have over 10 million daily active users relying on our product.
At peak usage, a million messages a minute pass through Slack.
During the week, our users spend over a billion minutes a day active in our product.


Machine Learning engineers at Slack touch a great variety of parts of our technical stack. At different points, you might find yourself building data pipelines, training recommendation models, fine tuning LLMs, implementing features in our application, or analyzing experiment data. We don’t expect everyone to be an expert in everything, but we are looking for candidates with experience in Machine Learning, a strength in at least a couple of these, and who are excited to learn the rest.

This is a practical Machine Learning team, not a research team. Our goal is to deliver business value with machine learning and data in whatever form that takes. Sometimes that means bootstrapping something simple like a logistic regression and moving on. Other times that means developing sophisticated, finely tuned models and novel solutions to Slack’s unique problem space. We are looking for engineers who are driven by driving impact for our business, building great products for our customers, and delivering robust, reliable services with machine learning.

What You Will Be Doing


Develop ML models supporting ranking, retrieval, and generative AI use-cases.
Brainstorm with Product Managers, Designers and Frontend Engineers to conceptualize and build new features for our large (and growing!) user base.
Produce high-quality results by leading or contributing heavily to large multi-functional projects that have a significant impact on the business.
Actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
Support in the development of sustainable data collection pipelines and management of ML features.
Assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving production issues.
Mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.


What You Should Have


7+ years of applicable engineering experience.
Experience with functional or imperative programming languages: PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, Scala or Java.
Built with common ML frameworks like pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, XGBoost, or Scikit-learn
Experience building batch data processing pipelines with tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, EMR, Map Reduce, Airflow, Dagster, or Luigi.
Worked on generative AI apps with Large Language Models and possibly fine tuned them
An analytical and data driven mindset, and know how to measure success with complicated ML/AI products.
Put machine learning models or other data-derived artifacts into production at scale.
Experience leading technical architecture discussions and helped drive technical decisions within the team.
The ability to write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
Strong communication skills and you are capable of explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other specialists.
Strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.


Nice To Have


Expertise in retrieval systems and search algorithms.
Familiarity with vector databases and embeddings.
Knowledge of using multiple data types in RAG solutions including structured, unstructured, and knowledge graphs.
Broad experience across NLP, ML, and Generative AI capabilities.

Microsoft Teams is the hub for teamwork that integrates all the people, content, and tools your team needs to be more engaged and effective. It is core to Microsoft’s modern work, modern life & modern education value prop. We are reinventing the way people communicate and work together across the globe.

We are looking to hire a PhD (or published MSc) candidate for a 12-week Research Internship to join CMD Labs – an applied science team within Microsoft Teams – to work on improving transcription accuracy specifically for Japanese, with emphasis on named entities (e.g., names of people/products/teams etc.) by applying existing or novel research and leveraging training, fine tuning, and prompt engineering of speech transformer models, as well as LLMs and audio-enabled foundations models as post-processing and re-scoring modules.

Our flagship AI applications for Teams Meetings such Team Copilot, Personal Meeting Copilot and Intelligent Recap are all fully dependent on an accurate meeting transcription as the primary grounding data. Within transcription, the importance of named entities - names of people, projects, products, companies and places - is often the most important, and yet the most challenging for the transcription engine since the names might not be a part of the model's training data.

The Research Intern will be onboarded to our evaluation pipeline code which takes as input real meetings that were donated internally, and work to iterate on existing algorithms as well as propose novel solutions to the problem based on recent academic literature. The work done in the Research Internship will contribute towards the algorithm that the engineering team will implement in production.

As a secondary priority, given substantial scientific novelty of the approach and results, collaboration on a mutual publication is also possible.

Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

The Role

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

Candidates should have experience and/or interest in some or all of:


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


Qualifications:


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


Working at Lila, you would have access to advanced technology in the areas of:


AI experimental design and simulation
Automated custom instrumentation
Generative molecular and material design

Work closely with our Credit Risk Machine Learning team to improve risk-scoring methodologies and loss forecasting models.
Support pricing and limit-setting strategies through quantitative analysis of risk-adjusted returns.
Design and evaluate tests to policy changes to measure the impact of credit risk strategies on financial performance.


Requirements


Master’s degree or Ph.D. in Statistics, Economics, Finance, Computer Science, or a related quantitative field.
3+ years of experience in credit risk analytics, underwriting strategy, or related data science roles in lending or financial services.
Strong experience with SQL and Python (or R) for data analysis and modeling.
Proficiency in credit risk modeling techniques, including logistic regression, scorecard development, and loss forecasting.
Familiarity with credit bureau data, alternative data sources, and regulatory risk considerations.

Bonus Points


Experience working in B2B SaaS or fintech, particularly in a lending environment.
Familiarity with risk-based pricing models and financial modeling techniques.

Our platform, which reinvents expensive and time-consuming accounting processes, is the first step in our vision to unlock the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on manual insurance operations.

Our Series B, announced in early 2025, led by BOND & Workday, comes on the heels of record growth and accelerating expansion plans.

Why you should consider joining


Record-setting growth, having gone from zero to 8-figure ARR within three years of founding, representing 95th+ percentile company growth among startups that achieve these revenue milestones
Strong product market fit revealed in growth and through customer love, with users describing the platform as “the best thing since sliced bread” and ""life-changing""
Our lean, talented team is creating category-defining products for large public and private enterprises, driving 7-figure ROI and cash-flow operations, providing the best of both worlds: outsized employee ownership and low company risk
We're continuing to take big, ambitious first-to-market bets for a highly committed customer base and an exciting pipeline of new customers
We’re in the early innings of our vision and poised to take advantage of the massive opportunity to deploy AI into core workflows throughout the insurance industry


About The Role

We're hiring an Applied Data Scientist to join us onsite in San Francisco. Our product is growing incredibly quickly, generating a massive dataset. But the insurance back office remains mired in manual processes. You'll have the opportunity to capitalize on this by building predictive models and AI-powered tools to transform what's possible for our customers.

Who you are


3+ years experience leveraging data-driven analysis and predictive modeling to drive key business decisions
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases
Contributed to predictive systems in a production environment
Excellent written and verbal communication skills; ability to clearly explain your work and collaborate with stakeholders
Comfortable with handling ambiguity and working in a self-directed manner
Curiosity about different industries and the data + business context within them


Projects you might work on


Leverage the latest models to build agents automating natural language-based workflows
Build a system to orchestrate + optimize the processing of millions of transactions
Analyze the efficacy of a new product launch & recommend + drive product improvements


Our team & philosophy

We’re backed by BOND, Spark Capital, Neo, and Workday, as well as founders/executives from Brex, Asana, Plaid, Applied Intuition, Coalition, and more.

Our team hails from companies like Airbnb, Google, Brex, and LiveRamp and we’re fairly low-profile: focusing the majority of our energy on delivering for customers and building a category-defining company.

We’re hiring predominantly in San Francisco 🌁, as we believe in-person collaboration is strategically important for a company at our stage — both for velocity and company culture.

Benefits


Competitive base salary and generous equity
Generous medical, dental, and vision benefits
401K plan enrollment
Flexible time-off policy
Lunch & dinner every day
Paid parental leave
Company outings and offsites
(and more benefits as we grow!)


Comulate is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture that celebrates authenticity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, protected veteran status, or any other legally protected characteristics.

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Staff and Senior level Machine Learning Engineers to craft and implement features, services, API methods, and models to leverage our data to make Slack a fabulous, robust, safe, and valuable product for our users. We work on applications across summarization, recommendation, ranking, and security, but ultimately are looking for engineers who can help drive impact with machine learning across the organization.

At Slack, your impact can be huge:


We have over 10 million daily active users relying on our product.
At peak usage, a million messages a minute pass through Slack.
During the week, our users spend over a billion minutes a day active in our product.


Machine Learning engineers at Slack touch a great variety of parts of our technical stack. At different points, you might find yourself building data pipelines, training recommendation models, fine tuning LLMs, implementing features in our application, or analyzing experiment data. We don’t expect everyone to be an expert in everything, but we are looking for candidates with experience in Machine Learning, a strength in at least a couple of these, and who are excited to learn the rest.

This is a practical Machine Learning team, not a research team. Our goal is to deliver business value with machine learning and data in whatever form that takes. Sometimes that means bootstrapping something simple like a logistic regression and moving on. Other times that means developing sophisticated, finely tuned models and novel solutions to Slack’s unique problem space. We are looking for engineers who are driven by driving impact for our business, building great products for our customers, and delivering robust, reliable services with machine learning.

What you will be doing:


Develop ML models supporting ranking, retrieval, and generative AI use-cases.
Brainstorm with Product Managers, Designers and Frontend Engineers to conceptualize and build new features for our large (and growing!) user base.
Produce high-quality results by leading or contributing heavily to large multi-functional projects that have a significant impact on the business.
Actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
Support in the development of sustainable data collection pipelines and management of ML features.
Assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving production issues.
Mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.


What you should have:


7+ years of applicable engineering experience.
Experience with functional or imperative programming languages: PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, Scala or Java.
Built with common ML frameworks like pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, XGBoost, or Scikit-learn
Experience building batch data processing pipelines with tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, EMR, Map Reduce, Airflow, Dagster, or Luigi.
Worked on generative AI apps with Large Language Models and possibly fine tuned them
An analytical and data driven mindset, and know how to measure success with complicated ML/AI products.
Put machine learning models or other data-derived artifacts into production at scale.
Experience leading technical architecture discussions and helped drive technical decisions within the team.
The ability to write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
Strong communication skills and you are capable of explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other specialists.
Strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.


Nice to have:


Expertise in retrieval systems and search algorithms.
Familiarity with vector databases and embeddings.
Knowledge of using multiple data types in RAG solutions including structured, unstructured, and knowledge graphs.
Broad experience across NLP, ML, and Generative AI capabilities.

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Slack is looking for a Staff and Senior level Machine Learning Engineers to craft and implement features, services, API methods, and models to leverage our data to make Slack a fabulous, robust, safe, and valuable product for our users.

We don’t expect everyone to be an expert in everything, but we are looking for candidates with experience in Machine Learning, a strength in at least a couple of these, and who are excited to learn the rest.

This is a practical Machine Learning team, not a research team. Our goal is to deliver business value with machine learning and data in whatever form that takes. Sometimes that means bootstrapping something simple like a logistic regression and moving on. Other times that means developing sophisticated, finely tuned models and novel solutions to Slack’s unique problem space. We are looking for engineers who are driven by driving impact for our business, building great products for our customers, and delivering robust, reliable services with machine learning.

What you will be doing:


Develop ML models supporting ranking, retrieval, and generative AI use-cases.

Produce high-quality results by leading or contributing heavily to large multi-functional projects that have a significant impact on the business.
Actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
Support in the development of sustainable data collection pipelines and management of ML features.
Assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving production issues.
Mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.


What you should have:


7+ years of applicable engineering experience.
Experience with functional or imperative programming languages: PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, Scala or Java.
Built with common ML frameworks like pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, XGBoost, or Scikit-learn
Experience building batch data processing pipelines with tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, EMR, Map Reduce, Airflow, Dagster, or Luigi.
Worked on generative AI apps with Large Language Models and possibly fine tuned them
An analytical and data driven mindset, and know how to measure success with complicated ML/AI products.
Put machine learning models or other data-derived artifacts into production at scale.
Experience leading technical architecture discussions and helped drive technical decisions within the team.
The ability to write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
Strong communication skills and you are capable of explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other specialists.
Strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.


Nice to have:


Expertise in retrieval systems and search algorithms.
Familiarity with vector databases and embeddings.
Knowledge of using multiple data types in RAG solutions including structured, unstructured, and knowledge graphs.
Broad experience across NLP, ML, and Generative AI capabilities.


Accommodations

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

Data Scientist (Business Operations)

The Business Operations Team at Wolt focuses on solving country- and region-specific marketplace challenges and is tasked with growing revenue and profitability. To do this, the team works to understand the underlying drivers of growth at the market level and identifies the best opportunities to have an impact.

We take on a diverse set of challenging questions in the geospatial, logistics, and economics spaces, focused on helping balance Wolt's multi-sided marketplace across an ecosystem of courier partners, customers, and merchant partners to achieve our topline and bottomline plans. Our work sees us optimizing the experience of our customers, contributing to providing growing income opportunities for our courier partners and merchants, and driving growth, efficiency, and profitability for Wolt overall.

We work with operations teams across 30 markets globally. Our core work covers customer retention, the economic efficiency of all our markets, and geospatial analysis - but our scope frequently expands to tackle issues beyond these topics.

The role

In this role, you will work closely with the regional leadership team, partnering with our General Managers and heads of operations and marketing in multiple markets.

This isn’t a normal Data Science role. You’ll combine strong technical skills and business acumen to partner with our regional leadership team. You will be the regional expert on connecting the dots across the business to help optimize our multi-sided marketplace. You will provide recommendations and consultation on business-critical issues through rigorous analysis paired with structured, big-picture thinking.

Day-to-day activities


Running data-driven research to uncover new insights and opportunities to help drive growth in the regions and fast track our operational strategy on a daily and weekly basis.
Working with Country GMs and Heads of Marketing and Operations to size and prioritize initiatives.
Some traveling to the local markets is expected.


About You

You’re not the typical Data Scientist. You have a passion for understanding the details behind the numbers and finding opportunities that really help the business hit its goals rather than building perfect models.

You understand how to balance rigor with speed and can help your business stakeholders navigate those tradeoffs as well.


3-5 years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or a related quantitative role.
Ability to delve into ambiguous problems for “treasure-hunting” with data and find creative new ways to think about our business.
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team.
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem-solving.
Proficiency in at least one programming language, preferably Python.
Ability to support & influence senior leadership in making critical decisions.


Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Breast cancer is the most treatable cancer, yet it remains the leading cause of death by cancer in women—largely because national screening programs miss up to 1 in 3 cases. The problem is even worse for women with dense breasts, who make up 50% of the screening population and for whom mammography is less reliable. At The Blue Box, we've developed a urine-based breast cancer test with a sensitivity of 88.42%, outperforming mammography by 15% overall—and by 30% in women with dense breasts. We're launching clinical trials in 2025 and bringing our test to gynecology clinics by 2026.

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our dynamic team and spearhead the technical aspects of our breast cancer diagnostic device development. The ideal candidate will possess a strong technical background, a teamwork-oriented mindset, and a passion for driving innovation in healthcare.

 

Job Description

Lead improvements in AI algorithms based on processing and data analysis of clinical examinations gathered with the device, prioritizing sensitivity and specificity for challenging classes.
Design and implement preprocessing pipelines: signal denoising, normalization, scaling, and feature extraction.
Keep our comprehensive dataset up to date, addressing data scarcity challenges.
Lead troubleshooting efforts and provide technical expertise to resolve complex issues encountered during development of AI models. 
Collaborate with our Head of Engineering and Clinical Lead in optimizing the quality of data readings obtained with our device.
Collaborate with our QA/RA Lead to ensure that all technical aspects of the AI algorithm development adhere to quality standards, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices. 




Requirements

Advanced degree in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Physics, Mathematics or a related field.
Proven track record of hands-on experience (≥3 years), ideally in the development of algorithms of pre-processing codes to classify multidimensional time series data, preferably in the field of Biology.
Experience in cross-validation strategies and handling class imbalance.
(Bonus) Knowledge of electronics and sensor signal acquisition.
Strong collaborative mindset, open to iterative model refinement based on feedback from engineers and clinicians. Ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to non-technical teams (e.g., Quality and Regulatory Office, Clinical Office…).
Fluency in English.




About the team

This is an in-person job with one optional work-from-home day per week. Our office space is at StartUB! (Barcelona). The current team is integrated by 8 people: CEO, Tech Lead, Operations Lead, Clinical Lead, QA/RA Manager, Project Manager, Lab Technician, Software Engineer.

Desired start date: June 2nd




How to apply

Please submit your application via LinkedIn including:

Breast cancer is the most treatable cancer, yet it remains the leading cause of death by cancer in women—largely because national screening programs miss up to 1 in 3 cases. The problem is even worse for women with dense breasts, who make up 50% of the screening population and for whom mammography is less reliable. At The Blue Box, we've developed a urine-based breast cancer test with a sensitivity of 88.42%, outperforming mammography by 15% overall—and by 30% in women with dense breasts. We're launching clinical trials in 2025 and bringing our test to gynecology clinics by 2026.

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our dynamic team and spearhead the technical aspects of our breast cancer diagnostic device development. The ideal candidate will possess a strong technical background, a teamwork-oriented mindset, and a passion for driving innovation in healthcare.

 

Job Description

Lead improvements in AI algorithms based on processing and data analysis of clinical examinations gathered with the device, prioritizing sensitivity and specificity for challenging classes.
Design and implement preprocessing pipelines: signal denoising, normalization, scaling, and feature extraction.

          <p><strong>About our company</strong></p><p>Breast cancer is the most treatable cancer, yet it remains the leading cause of death by cancer in women—largely because national screening programs miss up to 1 in 3 cases.

At The Blue Box, we've developed a urine-based breast cancer test with a sensitivity of 88.42%, outperforming mammography by 15% overall—and by 30% in women with dense breasts.
