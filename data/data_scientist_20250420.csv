Through our expertise, mindset, culture and most importantly with your help we are turning the AI landscape upside down. Are you excited to contribute to meaningful, impactful projects?




Our proposition to you





We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.


To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.


Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.


Transparent salary and career planning from day one.


A beautiful office in the centre of Kreuzberg, with tons of benefits, such as free drinks, snacks, consoles etc.


28 days of vacation


A shared revenue model - when Kineo does well, you will benefit financially, too





Success in the role means that you will have





After 2 months: You established yourself as a member of the team and have already contributed to one of our client projects. You have a clear understanding of how we work and can independently navigate our technical architecture.


After 6 months: You are a key member of the team and fully involved in the development of a client project. You will have made notable contributions to our codebase and internal processes.


After 12-24 months: In collaboration with internal science and engineering resources, you lead the development of a client-facing application from the workshop phase to production. You are a trusted expert in a wide variety of machine learning algorithms and you are able to transfer that knowledge to more junior members of the team.





Your Character Traits





You want to achieve something and don't need a ""manager"" to tell you that. You are eager to have space to take responsibility and grow from that.


You enjoy exploring beyond your immediate tasks and are open to learning new skills. You collaborate across different areas to help the team succeed, even in areas outside your main expertise.


You are a strong communicator with the ability to present ideas clearly and collaborate effectively. You value building positive relationships and working together to achieve shared goals.





You fit in with our team culture if you





Enjoy working in an environment that combines pragmatic, commercial thinking with a strong desire to learn and grow together. We value team players that are curious but convey humility and respect for different opinions.


You actively choose to work in a start-up, with all the ups and downs.


See open feedback, accountability and independent thinking as the foundation for exceptional (team) work.


You embrace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. You are excited to contribute to an environment where different perspectives are celebrated, and you actively participate in fostering awareness and continuous learning around DEI.



Tasks



You will work as part of smaller teams of 2-3 people on developing machine learning solutions with our clients.


You will conceptualize and implement algorithmic solutions to challenging business problems. This includes prototyping and productionizing of machine learning solutions, and also defining and analysing product use cases together with the customer.


You will own machine learning solutions from the first drop of raw data, all the way into production serving millions of inference requests.



Requirements



An advanced quantitative degree - e.g Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related fields. Strong knowledge of theoretical math and CS.


At least two years of work experience as Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.


Knowledge of working with large structured and unstructured data sets. Knowledge of data engineering tools like Apache Spark is an advantage.


Strong programming skills in Python. We love other languages too, but Python is what we (and you) will use.


We are AI Consultants - ask yourself: Do you want to be a Consultant?


Experience in using a wide range of ML frameworks such as SKLearn, Tensorflow, Torch in production. Experience with domain specific libraries like OpenCV, HuggingFace etc are an advantage.


Good written and verbal communication in both English and German. Most of our clients are German speaking so a level of at least B2 is required for the role.


Resident in Germany. Due to the size of the company, we cannot currently accept applications from other EU/non-EU countries.





We explicitly do not hire anyone who discriminates against people on the basis of religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status or other aspects. We encourage people from LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented groups to apply.




Last but not least, keep in mind that we are hiring value based, not skill based. That being said, please tell us the following in your contact message:

As a Machine Learning Engineer(d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees.

Being dedicated: You don't have to master everything, yet you fully support the team to reach our goals in a resultoriented way of working while fostering a culture of caring.


Dealing with ambiguity: Even if some challenges are vaguely defined, you make sense of what needs to be done.


Conversing in German: Ability to communicate in German with our clients with level B1 or higher.





Ideally, you also bring the following

READ BEFORE APPLYING: Adding a is mandatory for this position. We do this to get a better sense of candidates before continuing the process. Any application without a video will be rejected by default. Find instructions at the bottom of the post. No cover letter is required. Thank you!


At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability and ESG teams on the frontlines of solving the climate crisis.




We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients—including some of the world's largest firms—we’re already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.




Backed by €7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We’re based at the heart of Europe’s AI revolution—the AI Campus in Berlin—where we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.


Your role


As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to accelerate transition to a sustainable planet. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as exploring new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.





Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.


Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.


Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs and ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring how AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.


Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction and helps achieve our mission.



Your profile

What type of person we're looking for...



Knowledgable and experienced with building AI/LLM products: You have strong knowledge and experience of thinking through and building AI/LLM systems from prototyping and experiments through to deployment, evaluation, monitoring and improvement in production.


Practical Implementer: You are a ‘builder’ and aim to pragmatically integrate AI into real-world products, moving beyond research to create tangible, impactful solutions.


Personal agency and drive: must have personal agency, drive and ability to figure things out, learn and iterate to drive initiatives forward to success.


Innovative Thinker: You're driven by curiosity and continually experiment with new models, techniques and technologies in the rapidly evolving AI/LLM space.


Excellent Communicator: You have outstanding verbal and written communication skills in English, and can build strong relationships with internal teams and external partners.


Collaborative and Organised: You thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve success. Preferably with experience in start-ups.


Passion for ESG and Sustainability: You are motivated by using your skills to help address climate change and enthusiastic about building tools that help ESG and sustainability teams.



Technical Skills



Minimum of 4 years of experience: As an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI/ML Product Engineer or related roles.


Fluency in python: Including strong proficiency with base python as well as modern frameworks (e.g. fastAPI)


Experience with LLMs: Including core concepts around foundation models, prompt engineering and chains etc. as well as preferably some experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain). Experience using LLMs to build RAG systems and/or other real-world use-cases related to document processing would be a major bonus.


Experience with LLM evaluation: Including how to collect labelled data and systematically evaluate RAG and other real world LLM applications, preferably with experience in evaluation tools and frameworks (e.g. Langsmith)


Experience with production grade applications: Including familiarity with software development tools and practices for production applications (e.g git, CI/CD, containerization) and preferably some experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment (e.g. GCP, Modal). Any experience with cost/latency implications of deploying LLMs at scale would be a major bonus.


Fluency in English: With the ability to clearly communicate complex topics to diverse stakeholders. Any other European language would be a bonus.


Understanding or interest in sustainability: Including an interest in sustainability climate, or ESG topics and a desire to use your skills to help accelerate the climate transition.
Even if your experience doesn’t align precisely with all the criteria, we encourage you to apply. Many people miss out on opportunities because they feel they don’t fit every requirement—we believe in growth, not perfection!



What we offer



Competitive Remuneration: As a core member of our team, you will receive a competitive salary and equity package, reflecting your role in shaping Briink’s future.


Purpose-Driven Mission: ESG data has the power to create a more sustainable world, but today it presents more challenges than solutions. We believe AI can change that. Be part of the transition to an AI-powered, sustainable world.


Flexible Working: Our work philosophy is built on flexibility. While we do like to come to the office (in Berlin or London) to collaborate in person, this is a hybrid role with opportunities for some remote work within European time zones.


Trust and Ownership: At Briink, we empower you to own your projects with the option for growing into new roles. We believe in giving people autonomy and trust to drive your own initiatives.


Dynamic Work Environment: Based at the Merantix AI Campus, Berlin’s hub for AI innovation, you’ll work in a diverse, collaborative environment. With frequent events and opportunities for cross-company collaboration, you’ll be part of a thriving ecosystem of AI startups and experts.


Learning budget and quarterly hackathons: We truly believe in the importance of curiosity and experimentation as both a learning opportunity and strategic advantage. We therefore have a learning budget to explore new technologies and regular hackathons to prototype new ideas.

About Us

Right now, 25% of CO2 emissions in Europe are caused by heating our buildings. In order for this to be reduced, the transition towards renewable energy needs to be simplified and made more accessible. There are too few installers to meet the growing demand for heat pumps, and a solution to match this trend needs to be brought to the market.

autarc is developing the leading operating system (OS) for heat pump installers, enabling a more digital and efficient installation process for heat pumps.

Through this, autarc is reducing the hurdles to decarbonizing single-family homes and small apartment buildings in Europe, with the goal to help with the planning and designing of 1 million heat pumps by 2030.

Autonomy: Take ownership of your projects and enjoy a high degree of creative freedom
Competitive package: Receive a competitive salary and have the opportunity to participate in our VSIP program
Flexible work model: At Klim, we foster a flexible, hybrid work approach and facilitate hybrid/remote work (within Germany). It is advantageous for this role if you live in Berlin or can be present in our office regularly.
Additional benefits: We offer membership in the Urban Sports Club or the Deutschlandticket, team lunches (if in Berlin) and regular team events.


At Klim, we believe that a thriving workplace is built on the diverse backgrounds, talents, and perspectives of our team. We grow stronger together by embracing and building on each individual’s unique strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. All hiring and personnel decisions are made solely based on qualifications, performance, and the needs of the company—ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for all.

If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply. You might be the perfect fit for our team in ways you don’t yet realise!

truemetrics helps organizations to navigate the world more efficiently. We are solving one of the biggest pain points in last mile delivery: how to get parcels, groceries, and food to the right door faster and more efficiently.

Our technology sits in the smartphone of the courier and understands where they park and enter a building. Our technology is right now mapping locations in Kasachstan, Qatar, Germany, Switzerland, the UK and many other countries.

Who we are

We are a tech-driven, customer-obsessed company with a small but highly skilled team, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in mapping and positioning.

We thrive on autonomy, ownership, and speed—which means we’re looking for curious problem-solvers who love tackling hard challenges and making an immediate impact. If you want structure, rigid processes, and a slow corporate environment, this is not the place for you.

Why NOT to join us?

If you’re looking for a big team, a slow-paced environment, or a job where you can coast along without ownership, this probably isn’t the right fit. We move fast, iterate quickly, and expect everyone to contribute with initiative and creativity.

Requirements


You are based in Berlin or willing to relocate within four weeks of starting.
You thrive in a dynamic startup environment, where fast development cycles and quick deployment are essential.
You have 4+ years of experience in software engineering, data analysis, or software engineering management.

Cloud Expertise: You are familiar with AWS architecture and comfortable working with serverless tools (e.g., AWS Lambda, Athena, S3).
Customer-Focused Mindset: You enjoy working closely with customers, helping them get the most out of the product, and explaining technical concepts in an accessible way.
Allrounder: You are fine with switching between roles. Sometimes you are a project manager, sometimes a Data Scientist, sometimes a Backend engineer or QA engineer.

Your Role at Truemetrics

Data Exploration, Analysis & Improvement


Analyze and prepare data: By preparing data in a way that is easy to understand, you ensure our customers receive meaningful insights.
Customer Success & Onboarding: You help present our product to customers and continuously improve the early onboarding experience.
Support POCs & Pilot Projects: You help manage proof-of-concept (POC) and pilot projects, ensuring smooth execution and learning opportunities.


Software Engineering


Troubleshooting & Data Quality: If something breaks in our data, you investigate the root cause and propose solutions. If everything burns, you are playing the detective to find out what didn’t went well
Prototyping & Innovation: You design and implement early prototypes for new features and contribute ideas for improving our algorithms and data processing techniques.


How to Apply

Why we’re hiring for this role

Montamo is on a mission to revolutionize craftsmanship and solve the skilled labor shortage by building the most efficient installation process on the market. We’ve mastered operations through smart processes and software, and our platform, ""Lubo,"" is already transforming how heat pumps are installed and how tradespeople are trained.

But we’re just getting started. To take our operations, academy, and product to the next level, we need an Analytics Engineer who can build and own Montamo’s data stack from scratch. This role will be pivotal in enabling both in-product analytics for our groundbreaking guided installation platform and internal analytics to drive smarter business decisions across operations, talent development, and customer acquisition.

If you’re excited about shaping the data infrastructure of a fast-growing startup that’s redefining craftsmanship—and want to be part of the next big thing in clean energy solutions—this is your chance.

What you'll do

At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability and ESG teams on the frontlines of solving the climate crisis.




We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients—including some of the world's largest firms—we’re already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.




Backed by €7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We’re based at the heart of Europe’s AI revolution—the AI Campus in Berlin—where we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.


Your role


As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to accelerate transition to a sustainable planet. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as exploring new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.





Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.


Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.


Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs and ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring how AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.


Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction and helps achieve our mission.



Your profile

What type of person we're looking for...



Knowledgable and experienced with building AI/LLM products: You have strong knowledge and experience of thinking through and building AI/LLM systems from prototyping and experiments through to deployment, evaluation, monitoring and improvement in production.


Practical Implementer: You are a ‘builder’ and aim to pragmatically integrate AI into real-world products, moving beyond research to create tangible, impactful solutions.


Personal agency and drive: must have personal agency, drive and ability to figure things out, learn and iterate to drive initiatives forward to success.


Innovative Thinker: You're driven by curiosity and continually experiment with new models, techniques and technologies in the rapidly evolving AI/LLM space.


Excellent Communicator: You have outstanding verbal and written communication skills in English, and can build strong relationships with internal teams and external partners.


Collaborative and Organised: You thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve success. Preferably with experience in start-ups.


Passion for ESG and Sustainability: You are motivated by using your skills to help address climate change and enthusiastic about building tools that help ESG and sustainability teams.



Technical Skills



Minimum of 4 years of experience: As an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI/ML Product Engineer or related roles.


Fluency in python: Including strong proficiency with base python as well as modern frameworks (e.g. fastAPI)


Experience with LLMs: Including core concepts around foundation models, prompt engineering and chains etc. as well as preferably some experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain). Experience using LLMs to build RAG systems and/or other real-world use-cases related to document processing would be a major bonus.


Experience with LLM evaluation: Including how to collect labelled data and systematically evaluate RAG and other real world LLM applications, preferably with experience in evaluation tools and frameworks (e.g. Langsmith)


Experience with production grade applications: Including familiarity with software development tools and practices for production applications (e.g git, CI/CD, containerization) and preferably some experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment (e.g. GCP, Modal). Any experience with cost/latency implications of deploying LLMs at scale would be a major bonus.


Fluency in English: With the ability to clearly communicate complex topics to diverse stakeholders. Any other European language would be a bonus.


Understanding or interest in sustainability: Including an interest in sustainability climate, or ESG topics and a desire to use your skills to help accelerate the climate transition.
Even if your experience doesn’t align precisely with all the criteria, we encourage you to apply. Many people miss out on opportunities because they feel they don’t fit every requirement—we believe in growth, not perfection!



What we offer



Competitive Remuneration: As a core member of our team, you will receive a competitive salary and equity package, reflecting your role in shaping Briink’s future.


Purpose-Driven Mission: ESG data has the power to create a more sustainable world, but today it presents more challenges than solutions. We believe AI can change that. Be part of the transition to an AI-powered, sustainable world.


Flexible Working: Our work philosophy is built on flexibility. While we do like to come to the office (in Berlin or London) to collaborate in person, this is a hybrid role with opportunities for some remote work within European time zones.


Trust and Ownership: At Briink, we empower you to own your projects with the option for growing into new roles. We believe in giving people autonomy and trust to drive your own initiatives.


Dynamic Work Environment: Based at the Merantix AI Campus, Berlin’s hub for AI innovation, you’ll work in a diverse, collaborative environment. With frequent events and opportunities for cross-company collaboration, you’ll be part of a thriving ecosystem of AI startups and experts.


Learning budget and quarterly hackathons: We truly believe in the importance of curiosity and experimentation as both a learning opportunity and strategic advantage. We therefore have a learning budget to explore new technologies and regular hackathons to prototype new ideas.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.




Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.




Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.




As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:





Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.




Requirements





A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact


Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice.

DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

The Data + Science Team




At Deliveroo we have a world-class data & science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We have over 200 Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and Analytics Engineers working throughout the company in product, business and platform teams.




We have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things.




The Role




We are hiring several Senior and mid-level MLE positions in many different teams across all sides of our marketplace (consumer, delivery, restaurants, grocery, and retail). Our interview process is team-agnostic.




As an MLE, you will develop the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will work in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has independence and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of our three-sided marketplace (riders, consumers, and restaurants). We evaluate the performance of all our decision-making machines through our world-class experimentation platform.




Depending on the team you join, you will build intelligent decision-making machines that may:





Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real-time delays.


Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time.


Optimise consumer and rider fees.


Improve the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes.


Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants.


Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish.





Requirements





3+ years' experience as a ML Engineer or Data Scientist


3+ years' experience in Python


Experience productionising ML models


Experience using tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CircleCI


You know the fundamentals of machine learning and when they should be applied


You can translate an unstructured business problem into a well-thought-out algorithmic solution


You get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business


You have a bias to simplicity, where you care most about achieving impact





The Company




Our mission is to be the definitive food company. We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & Benefits




At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




Diversity




At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.




Who we're looking for

We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to play a key role in our Core Pricing team. You will drive innovation by optimising and automating Pricing processes to enable faster, more accurate decision-making. Your work will focus on developing and maintaining tooling and frameworks that enhance the efficiency of our predictive models, reducing deployment times, increasing scalability, and improving model performance through regular updates and monitoring. You will work closely with our Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product team to deliver scalable, production-grade ML systems.




Key Responsibilities

Build model lifecycle tooling (deployment, monitoring and alerting) for our predictive models (for example claims cost, conversion, retention, market models)
Maintain and improve the development environment (Kubeflow) used by our Data Scientists and Actuaries
Develop and maintain pricing analytics tools that enable faster impact assessments, reducing manual work
Collaborate with the technical pricing, street pricing and product teams to gather requirements and feedback on tooling and to build impactful technology
Communicate complex concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders through clear storytelling




Required Skills

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science or related field
Experience: Proven experience in ML model lifecycle management
Core Competencies:
Model lifecycle: You’ve got hands-on experience with managing the ML model lifecycle, including both online and batch processes
Statistical Methodology: You have worked with GLMs and other machine learning algorithms and have in-depth knowledge of how they work
Python: You have built and deployed production-grade Python applications and you are familiar with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
Tooling & Environment:
DevOps: You have experience working with DevOps tooling, such as gitops, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools (we use buildkite) and Docker
Cloud: You have worked with cloud-based environments before (we use AWS)
SQL: You have a good grasp of SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Version control: You are proficient with git
Soft Skills:
You are an excellent communicator, with an ability to translate non-technical requirements into clear, actionable pieces of work
You have proven your project management skills, with the ability to manage multiple priorities
You have worked closely together in cross-functional teams, including with Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product Managers




Nice To Have

Experience in UK motor insurance
Telematics Data: Familiarity with behavioural driving data and its application in insurance pricing
Understanding of pricing modelling tools such as Akur8 or Emblem
Experience with IaC (we use Terraform)
Experience with gRPC/protobuf

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world’s only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you’ll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.




This job might be for you if you’ve got…

Experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You’ve built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don’t just analyze numbers—you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You’ve used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities.
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that’ll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it’s regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don’t just apply models—you understand how they work under the hood.
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics.
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You’ve worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization.
Familiarity with AI and deep learning principles. You know how artificial intelligence models (including RAG) can be adapted to automate and optimize business tasks. You’ve explored the potential of AI beyond just theory.
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You’re the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point.
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don’t just crunch numbers—you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You’re proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability.
Industry know-how that adds value. If you’ve got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that’s a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI.




Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you’re nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can’t wait to meet you.




Other Qualities You’ll Need

You’re humble––you put the team and others’ needs ahead of your own
You’re hungry to learn more
You’re people smart––in the sense that you’re a great teammate

The truth is, if you don’t have these qualities you won’t last long at AlgaeCal. So if you’re missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.




What Will You Earn?

We believe in rewarding top talent. Let’s talk about salary once we’ve had the chance to get to know you better. Rest assured, we’re generous and offer above-market pay for the right person. If you bring the skills and experience, we’ll make sure the compensation reflects that.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

Your models don’t just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you —read on.

AlgaeCal is looking for a top-tier Data Scientist Intern who can turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.




This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we’re driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world’s only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you’ll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.




This job might be for you if you’ve got…

Experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You’ve built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don’t just analyze numbers—you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You’ve used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities.
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that’ll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it’s regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don’t just apply models—you understand how they work under the hood.
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics.
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You’ve worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization.
Familiarity with AI and deep learning principles. You know how artificial intelligence models (including RAG) can be adapted to automate and optimize business tasks. You’ve explored the potential of AI beyond just theory.
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You’re the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point.
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don’t just crunch numbers—you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You’re proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability.
Industry know-how that adds value. If you’ve got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that’s a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI.




Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you’re nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can’t wait to meet you.




Other Qualities You’ll Need

At AlgaeCal we’re going to insist that you have these 3 qualities:

You’re humble––you put the team and others’ needs ahead of your own
You’re hungry to learn more
You’re people smart––in the sense that you’re a great teammate

The truth is, if you don’t have these qualities you won’t last long at AlgaeCal. So if you’re missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.




What Will You Earn?

We believe in rewarding top talent. Let’s talk about salary once we’ve had the chance to get to know you better. Rest assured, we’re generous and offer above-market pay for the right person. If you bring the skills and experience, we’ll make sure the compensation reflects that.




You’ll also enjoy the following benefits:

Monthly team events and activities
Flexible Stat Holidays with the option to bank days for later use
Weekly team lunches
Casual dress code
Incredible dog friendly, Yaletown office one block from SkyTrain
Remote working is okay with us too.

And above all, you’ll join a team that you’ll never want to leave. Culture is everything to us. Yes, we work extremely hard to change as many people’s lives as possible. But we know how to have fun and reward ourselves too.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements

Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations

Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

What you’ll do

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Credit Detection brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s credit risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. Achieving this goal is critical to Stripe’s long term growth and profitability. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from credit losses that can put our financial position at risk.

The Credit Detection team consists of machine learning engineers who want to tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We work closely with our credit partners in product, business, data science, and operations to prioritize and drive our shared strategy.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Support Experience engineering team builds and improves Stripe’s user support from end to end: how users get help within our products, how they get in touch with us when they have questions, and how our teams use internal tools to answer those questions. We’re accountable for the quality and reliability of this support stack and we use data and firsthand user research to continuously improve it.

Providing great support to users of all sizes is culturally important to everyone at Stripe. We are a group of friendly, user-oriented engineers that partner closely with Stripe’s world-class design, product, and operational teams. This includes the external-facing support interfaces (support.stripe.com), content, entry points, internal tooling, case routing, and helping product teams across the company reduce support volume by improving our products. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine support experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive.

What you’ll do

As a Machine Learning Engineer on the Support Experience team, you'll play a crucial role in enhancing our self-serve support experiences. You will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production. For example, we apply LLMs to answer user questions with conversational agents and personalize product documentation, and are building automated systems to solve complex user problems. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers, product managers, and data scientists to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Design and implement state-of-the-art ML models and large scale ML systems for enhancing self-serve support capabilities, balancing ML principles, domain knowledge, and engineering constraints

Previous leadership or mentorship experience
Previous experience building ML solutions focused on support
Experience with LLMs and prompt engineering
Comfortable working with distributed teams across multiple locations and time zones
Proven track record of building and deploying ML systems that have effectively solved ambiguous business problems



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$193,500 - C$290,300. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world’s only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you’ll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.




This job might be for you if you’ve got…

Experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You’ve built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don’t just analyze numbers—you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You’ve used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities.
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that’ll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it’s regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don’t just apply models—you understand how they work under the hood.
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics.
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You’ve worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization.
Familiarity with AI and deep learning principles. You know how artificial intelligence models (including RAG) can be adapted to automate and optimize business tasks. You’ve explored the potential of AI beyond just theory.
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You’re the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point.
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don’t just crunch numbers—you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You’re proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability.
Industry know-how that adds value. If you’ve got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that’s a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI.




Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you’re nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can’t wait to meet you.




Other Qualities You’ll Need

At AlgaeCal we’re going to insist that you have these 3 qualities:

You’re humble––you put the team and others’ needs ahead of your own
You’re hungry to learn more
You’re people smart––in the sense that you’re a great teammate

The truth is, if you don’t have these qualities you won’t last long at AlgaeCal. So if you’re missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.




What Will You Earn?

We believe in rewarding top talent. Let’s talk about salary once we’ve had the chance to get to know you better. Rest assured, we’re generous and offer above-market pay for the right person. If you bring the skills and experience, we’ll make sure the compensation reflects that.

Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.
