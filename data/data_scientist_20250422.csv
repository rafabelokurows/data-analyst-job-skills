Why we’re hiring for this role

Montamo is on a mission to revolutionize craftsmanship and solve the skilled labor shortage by building the most efficient installation process on the market. We’ve mastered operations through smart processes and software, and our platform, ""Lubo,"" is already transforming how heat pumps are installed and how tradespeople are trained.

But we’re just getting started. To take our operations, academy, and product to the next level, we need an Analytics Engineer who can build and own Montamo’s data stack from scratch. This role will be pivotal in enabling both in-product analytics for our groundbreaking guided installation platform and internal analytics to drive smarter business decisions across operations, talent development, and customer acquisition.

If you’re excited about shaping the data infrastructure of a fast-growing startup that’s redefining craftsmanship—and want to be part of the next big thing in clean energy solutions—this is your chance.

What you'll do

You'll Own


Building Montamo's data foundation from scratch
Design and implement our data infrastructure including pipelines, warehouse, and governance
Create a unified data model that connects installation metrics, training outcomes, and customer journeys
In-product analytics for Lubo
Develop performance dashboards for technicians and operations teams
Identify user behavior patterns to improve our guided installation platform
Work with product to embed actionable insights directly into the technician experience
Internal analytics for business intelligence
Build leadership dashboards tracking KPIs across operations, academy, and customer acquisition
Transform raw operational data into insights that drive smarter decision-making
Enable data-driven optimization of technician scheduling and supply chain
Scale with pragmatism
Implement lightweight solutions that deliver immediate value while supporting future growth
Continuously evolve our data architecture as Montamo expands into new regions and services

Our developing tech stack & practices

While our AI/data stack is just getting started, you’ll have the freedom to shape it using modern tools:


Data pipeline tools: Airflow or dbt (or your preferred choice!)
Data storage: Postgres (for now), Snowflake or BigQuery (as we scale)
Analytics tools: Looker Studio for dashboards; Python/R for deeper analysis
Event tracking: TBD—you’ll help us decide!


We love pragmatic approaches that focus on delivering value fast without compromising quality. You’ll work closely with our software engineering team building Lubo on Next.js/Node.js/Postgres.

Dein Profil

You’re Our Match If You


Have 2-4 years of experience shipping AI systems and can navigate full-stack development
Get excited about:
Edge cases of deploying vision models on construction sites
Optimizing RAG pipelines for non-English speakers
Building “good enough now, scalable later” solutions
Can answer these cold: “How would you compress a vision model for offline use on low-end Android devices?” “Explain fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering tradeoffs for multilingual support” “Debug a Next.js API route that’s timing out on GPU-heavy inference”
Bonus superpowers


Experience with voice interfaces or IoT sensor integration
German language skills to interact without intermediary your users
Passion for climate tech, craftmenship and/or upskilling workers


Our Engineering Lead Kristian has written a blog post on hiring and our values. Please read this before applying and joining the first interview to get an idea if you could be the match we're looking for.

At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability and ESG teams on the frontlines of solving the climate crisis.




We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients—including some of the world's largest firms—we’re already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.




Backed by €7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We’re based at the heart of Europe’s AI revolution—the AI Campus in Berlin—where we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.


Your role


As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to accelerate transition to a sustainable planet. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as exploring new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.





Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.


Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.


Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs and ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring how AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.


Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction and helps achieve our mission.



Your profile

What type of person we're looking for...



Knowledgable and experienced with building AI/LLM products: You have strong knowledge and experience of thinking through and building AI/LLM systems from prototyping and experiments through to deployment, evaluation, monitoring and improvement in production.


Practical Implementer: You are a ‘builder’ and aim to pragmatically integrate AI into real-world products, moving beyond research to create tangible, impactful solutions.


Personal agency and drive: must have personal agency, drive and ability to figure things out, learn and iterate to drive initiatives forward to success.


Innovative Thinker: You're driven by curiosity and continually experiment with new models, techniques and technologies in the rapidly evolving AI/LLM space.


Excellent Communicator: You have outstanding verbal and written communication skills in English, and can build strong relationships with internal teams and external partners.


Collaborative and Organised: You thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve success. Preferably with experience in start-ups.


Passion for ESG and Sustainability: You are motivated by using your skills to help address climate change and enthusiastic about building tools that help ESG and sustainability teams.



Technical Skills



Minimum of 4 years of experience: As an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI/ML Product Engineer or related roles.


Fluency in python: Including strong proficiency with base python as well as modern frameworks (e.g. fastAPI)


Experience with LLMs: Including core concepts around foundation models, prompt engineering and chains etc. as well as preferably some experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain). Experience using LLMs to build RAG systems and/or other real-world use-cases related to document processing would be a major bonus.


Experience with LLM evaluation: Including how to collect labelled data and systematically evaluate RAG and other real world LLM applications, preferably with experience in evaluation tools and frameworks (e.g. Langsmith)


Experience with production grade applications: Including familiarity with software development tools and practices for production applications (e.g git, CI/CD, containerization) and preferably some experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment (e.g. GCP, Modal). Any experience with cost/latency implications of deploying LLMs at scale would be a major bonus.


Fluency in English: With the ability to clearly communicate complex topics to diverse stakeholders. Any other European language would be a bonus.


Understanding or interest in sustainability: Including an interest in sustainability climate, or ESG topics and a desire to use your skills to help accelerate the climate transition.
Even if your experience doesn’t align precisely with all the criteria, we encourage you to apply. Many people miss out on opportunities because they feel they don’t fit every requirement—we believe in growth, not perfection!



What we offer



Competitive Remuneration: As a core member of our team, you will receive a competitive salary and equity package, reflecting your role in shaping Briink’s future.


Purpose-Driven Mission: ESG data has the power to create a more sustainable world, but today it presents more challenges than solutions. We believe AI can change that. Be part of the transition to an AI-powered, sustainable world.


Flexible Working: Our work philosophy is built on flexibility. While we do like to come to the office (in Berlin or London) to collaborate in person, this is a hybrid role with opportunities for some remote work within European time zones.


Trust and Ownership: At Briink, we empower you to own your projects with the option for growing into new roles. We believe in giving people autonomy and trust to drive your own initiatives.


Dynamic Work Environment: Based at the Merantix AI Campus, Berlin’s hub for AI innovation, you’ll work in a diverse, collaborative environment. With frequent events and opportunities for cross-company collaboration, you’ll be part of a thriving ecosystem of AI startups and experts.


Learning budget and quarterly hackathons: We truly believe in the importance of curiosity and experimentation as both a learning opportunity and strategic advantage. We therefore have a learning budget to explore new technologies and regular hackathons to prototype new ideas.

About Us

Right now, 25% of CO2 emissions in Europe are caused by heating our buildings. In order for this to be reduced, the transition towards renewable energy needs to be simplified and made more accessible. There are too few installers to meet the growing demand for heat pumps, and a solution to match this trend needs to be brought to the market.

autarc is developing the leading operating system (OS) for heat pump installers, enabling a more digital and efficient installation process for heat pumps.

Through this, autarc is reducing the hurdles to decarbonizing single-family homes and small apartment buildings in Europe, with the goal to help with the planning and designing of 1 million heat pumps by 2030.

At Pallon, a spin-off from ETH Zurich, we’re creating AI that automatically detects defects in sewer inspection videos and advises cities on when & how to fix them. By providing more precise, objective data, we aim to fix wastewater leaks, reduce CO2 emissions, and prevent urban flooding. Our mission is to make cities more sustainable and resilient.

The Role

This is a hands-on, high-impact role. You’ll make decisions on model selection, system architecture, and performance tradeoffs, while also diving deep into the code and data — whether that’s reading research papers, optimizing GPU training performance, debugging a tricky edge case, or reviewing videos to understand the remaining failure cases.

In this role, you will:


Research and develop computer vision methods for scene understanding (like 3D reconstruction, SLAM, object detection, segmentation) to solve real-world problems.
Work hands-on to turn your research into robust, production-ready code.
Help improve how we do research, design software, and maintain code quality.
Share your knowledge and help mentor other engineers on the team.


Requirements

We are looking for candidates with:


Either: a PhD focused on Machine Learning or Computer Vision with publications at well-known conferences.
Or: 5+ years of industry experience taking Machine Learning projects from research to production, coupled with a degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, or similar.


Successful candidates will also demonstrate:


Strong collaborative and communication skills, contributing to an environment of mutual learning.
The ability to work independently but know when to team up or ask questions.
Solid software engineering experience building real-world systems as part of a team.


Our Tech Stack

You don’t need to have experience with all of this — but here’s what we use today:


Deep Learning: Python, Pytorch
Computer Vision: C++, OpenCV, Ceres, Eigen
Infrastructure: Slurm, our GPU cluster, Kubernetes, Docker


Benefits & Team Culture

As a part of Pallon, you will:


Contribute to a positive impact on society and the environment.

At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability and ESG teams on the frontlines of solving the climate crisis.




We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients—including some of the world's largest firms—we’re already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.




Backed by €7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We’re based at the heart of Europe’s AI revolution—the AI Campus in Berlin—where we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.


Your role


As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to accelerate transition to a sustainable planet. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as exploring new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.





Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.


Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.


Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs and ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring how AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.


Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction and helps achieve our mission.



Your profile

What type of person we're looking for...



Knowledgable and experienced with building AI/LLM products: You have strong knowledge and experience of thinking through and building AI/LLM systems from prototyping and experiments through to deployment, evaluation, monitoring and improvement in production.


Practical Implementer: You are a ‘builder’ and aim to pragmatically integrate AI into real-world products, moving beyond research to create tangible, impactful solutions.


Personal agency and drive: must have personal agency, drive and ability to figure things out, learn and iterate to drive initiatives forward to success.


Innovative Thinker: You're driven by curiosity and continually experiment with new models, techniques and technologies in the rapidly evolving AI/LLM space.


Excellent Communicator: You have outstanding verbal and written communication skills in English, and can build strong relationships with internal teams and external partners.


Collaborative and Organised: You thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve success. Preferably with experience in start-ups.


Passion for ESG and Sustainability: You are motivated by using your skills to help address climate change and enthusiastic about building tools that help ESG and sustainability teams.



Technical Skills



Minimum of 4 years of experience: As an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI/ML Product Engineer or related roles.


Fluency in python: Including strong proficiency with base python as well as modern frameworks (e.g. fastAPI)


Experience with LLMs: Including core concepts around foundation models, prompt engineering and chains etc. as well as preferably some experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain). Experience using LLMs to build RAG systems and/or other real-world use-cases related to document processing would be a major bonus.


Experience with LLM evaluation: Including how to collect labelled data and systematically evaluate RAG and other real world LLM applications, preferably with experience in evaluation tools and frameworks (e.g. Langsmith)


Experience with production grade applications: Including familiarity with software development tools and practices for production applications (e.g git, CI/CD, containerization) and preferably some experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment (e.g. GCP, Modal). Any experience with cost/latency implications of deploying LLMs at scale would be a major bonus.


Fluency in English: With the ability to clearly communicate complex topics to diverse stakeholders. Any other European language would be a bonus.


Understanding or interest in sustainability: Including an interest in sustainability climate, or ESG topics and a desire to use your skills to help accelerate the climate transition.
Even if your experience doesn’t align precisely with all the criteria, we encourage you to apply. Many people miss out on opportunities because they feel they don’t fit every requirement—we believe in growth, not perfection!



What we offer



Competitive Remuneration: As a core member of our team, you will receive a competitive salary and equity package, reflecting your role in shaping Briink’s future.


Purpose-Driven Mission: ESG data has the power to create a more sustainable world, but today it presents more challenges than solutions. We believe AI can change that. Be part of the transition to an AI-powered, sustainable world.


Flexible Working: Our work philosophy is built on flexibility. While we do like to come to the office (in Berlin or London) to collaborate in person, this is a hybrid role with opportunities for some remote work within European time zones.


Trust and Ownership: At Briink, we empower you to own your projects with the option for growing into new roles. We believe in giving people autonomy and trust to drive your own initiatives.


Dynamic Work Environment: Based at the Merantix AI Campus, Berlin’s hub for AI innovation, you’ll work in a diverse, collaborative environment. With frequent events and opportunities for cross-company collaboration, you’ll be part of a thriving ecosystem of AI startups and experts.


Learning budget and quarterly hackathons: We truly believe in the importance of curiosity and experimentation as both a learning opportunity and strategic advantage. We therefore have a learning budget to explore new technologies and regular hackathons to prototype new ideas.

Additional benefits: We offer membership in the Urban Sports Club or the Deutschlandticket, team lunches (if in Berlin) and regular team events.


At Klim, we believe that a thriving workplace is built on the diverse backgrounds, talents, and perspectives of our team. We grow stronger together by embracing and building on each individual’s unique strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. All hiring and personnel decisions are made solely based on qualifications, performance, and the needs of the company—ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for all.

If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply. You might be the perfect fit for our team in ways you don’t yet realise!

About Us

Right now, 25% of CO2 emissions in Europe are caused by heating our buildings. In order for this to be reduced, the transition towards renewable energy needs to be simplified and made more accessible. There are too few installers to meet the growing demand for heat pumps, and a solution to match this trend needs to be brought to the market.

autarc is developing the leading operating system (OS) for heat pump installers, enabling a more digital and efficient installation process for heat pumps.

Through this, autarc is reducing the hurdles to decarbonizing single-family homes and small apartment buildings in Europe, with the goal to help with the planning and designing of 1 million heat pumps by 2030.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As a Startups Solutions Architect on the Applied AI team at Anthropic, you will be a Pre-Sales architect focused on becoming a trusted technical advisor helping the EMEA Startup Community understand the value of Claude and paint the vision on how they can successfully integrate and deploy Claude into their technology stack and product. You'll combine your deep technical expertise with customer-facing skills to help customers understand the potential of working with LLMs and architect innovative LLM solutions that address complex business challenges while maintaining our high standards for safety and reliability.

Working closely with our Sales, Product, and Engineering teams, you'll guide customers from initial technical discovery through successful deployment. You'll leverage your expertise to help customers understand Claude's capabilities, develop evals, and design scalable architectures that maximize the value of our AI systems.

Responsibilities


Partner with account executives to deeply understand startup requirements and translate them into technical solutions, ensuring alignment between business objectives and technical implementation

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

£105,000 - £160,000 GBP

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We evaluate the performance of all our decision-making machines through our world-class experimentation platform.




Depending on the team you join, you will build intelligent decision-making machines that may:





Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real-time delays.


Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time.


Optimise consumer and rider fees.


Improve the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes.


Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants.


Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish.

3+ years' experience as a ML Engineer or Data Scientist


3+ years' experience in Python


Experience productionising ML models


Experience using tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CircleCI


You know the fundamentals of machine learning and when they should be applied


You can translate an unstructured business problem into a well-thought-out algorithmic solution


You get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business


You have a bias to simplicity, where you care most about achieving impact





The Company




Our mission is to be the definitive food company. We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & Benefits




At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




Diversity




At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

£105,000 - £160,000 GBP

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

At Cleo, we're not just building another fintech app. We're embarking on a mission to fundamentally change humanity's relationship with money. Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of background or income, has access to a hyper-intelligent financial advisor in their pocket. That's the future we're creating.

Cleo is a rare success story: a profitable, fast-growing unicorn with over $200 million in ARR and growing over 2x year-over-year. This isn't just a job; it's a chance to join a team of brilliant, driven individuals who are passionate about making a real difference. We have an exceptionally high bar for talent, seeking individuals who are not only at the top of their field but also embody our culture of collaboration and positive impact.

If you’re driven by complex challenges that push your expertise, the chance to shape something truly transformative, and the potential to share in Cleo’s success as we scale, while growing alongside a company that’s scaling fast, this might be your perfect fit.

Follow us on LinkedIn to keep up to date with new product features and insights from the team.

About The Role

Machine Learning Engineers at Cleo work on building novel solutions to real-world problems. This really does vary but could be: creating chatbots to coach our users around their financial health, creating classifiers to better understand transaction data or even optimising transactions within our payments platform.

Ultimately, we’re looking for a brilliant Machine Learning Engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be leading technical work within a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers, who train & integrate cutting edge machine learning across a variety of products and deploy them into production for millions of users. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.

Here Are Some Examples, Big And Small, Of The Kinds Of Product Feature Work Our ML Engineers Have Taken Part In Over The Last Year


Designed and implemented AI agents to analyse and extract insights from users’ transactional data.
Developed models to interpret transactional data, enhancing the understanding of users’ finances. Think about your bank statement—how often do you not recognise a transaction on first review?
Created contextual intent classifiers to understand user conversations with Cleo, enabling tailored and accurate platform responses.
Engineered ML models to identify and deliver relevant actions to users within Cleo, ensuring a seamless, context-aware conversational experience.
Built models to evaluate risk in customer interactions with bank transaction features and user activities.
Developed optimisation models to improve payment success rates for customers while minimising business costs, tackling this as a two-sided optimisation challenge.


Whatever problem you tackle, and whichever team you join, your work will directly impact those most in need, helping to improve their financial health.

Experience Required


Excellent knowledge of both Data Science (Python, SQL) and production tools
Experience building chat products
A deep understanding of probability and statistics fundamentals
Big picture thinking to correctly diagnose problems and productionising research
Top tier communication skills, to be able to partner with Product and Commercial Leaders
Industry-leading contributions to your field, communicated through conferences, blogs, talks, or open-source projects


What You’ll Need


3+years of experience in data science, machine learning engineering, or related roles
Excellent knowledge of both Data Science (python, SQL) and production tools
Strong ability to communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders
Experience deploying machine learning models into production; familiarity with Docker containers and container orchestration tools is a plus


What do you get for all your hard work?


A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews, aligned to our quarterly OKR planning cycles. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility. We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
Other benefits;
Company-wide performance reviews every 6 months
Generous pay increases for high-performing team members
Equity top-ups for team members getting promoted
25 days annual leave a year + public holidays (+ an additional day for every year you spend at Cleo, up to 30 days)
6% employer-matched pension in the UK
Private Medical Insurance via Vitality, dental cover, and life assurance
Enhanced parental leave
1 month paid sabbatical after 4 years at Cleo
Regular socials and activities, online and in-person
We'll pay for your OpenAI subscription
Online mental health support via Spill
Workplace Nursery Scheme
And many more!
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US – where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions.

Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Your models don’t just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you —read on.

AlgaeCal is looking for a top-tier Data Scientist Intern who can turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.




This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we’re driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world’s only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you’ll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.




This job might be for you if you’ve got…

Experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You’ve built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don’t just analyze numbers—you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You’ve used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities.
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that’ll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it’s regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don’t just apply models—you understand how they work under the hood.
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics.
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You’ve worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization.
Familiarity with AI and deep learning principles. You know how artificial intelligence models (including RAG) can be adapted to automate and optimize business tasks. You’ve explored the potential of AI beyond just theory.
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You’re the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point.
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don’t just crunch numbers—you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You’re proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability.
Industry know-how that adds value. If you’ve got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that’s a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI.




Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you’re nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can’t wait to meet you.




Other Qualities You’ll Need

At AlgaeCal we’re going to insist that you have these 3 qualities:

You’re humble––you put the team and others’ needs ahead of your own
You’re hungry to learn more
You’re people smart––in the sense that you’re a great teammate

The truth is, if you don’t have these qualities you won’t last long at AlgaeCal. So if you’re missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.




What Will You Earn?

We believe in rewarding top talent. Let’s talk about salary once we’ve had the chance to get to know you better. Rest assured, we’re generous and offer above-market pay for the right person. If you bring the skills and experience, we’ll make sure the compensation reflects that.

We are a frontier research lab driving the future of decentralized open-source AI. Our core team includes specialists in cryptography, computational economics, and large-scale deep learning who have published at top-tier venues. We collaborate on next-generation models and often incorporate insights from new arXiv papers before they become mainstream.




Role Overview




We encourage curiosity-driven research and welcome bold, untested concepts. You will explore new theories and AI model architectures, conduct proofs-of-concept, and fuse ideas from ML, math, and cryptography. Our environment demands both creativity and rigor. We love novel insights backed by strong experimentation or formal justification.




Key Responsibilities




Investigate or develop new AI methodologies that might reshape decentralized model training.
Rapidly prototype research ideas using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or custom CUDA kernels.
Collaborate with cryptographers and economists to integrate secure, incentive-aligned protocols into AI model pipelines.
Share findings through internal research notes, external blog posts, and conference-level papers. Examples: blog.bagel.net
Contribute to open-source projects, mentor junior team members, and maintain close ties with the broader research community




Who You Might Be




You actively consume the latest ML research - scanning arXiv, attending conferences, dissecting new open-source releases, and integrating breakthroughs into your own experimentation. You thrive on first-principles reasoning, see potential in unexplored ideas, and view learning as a perpetual process.




Desired Skills (Flexible)




Strong foundation in modern deep learning, including Transformers, Diffusion and large-scale optimization
Exposure to at least one specialized domains like RL, Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion modeling, or distributed training.
Solid grounding in mathematics and statistics for designing and interpreting novel experiments.
Clear and concise communication style in both written and spoken form.
Bonus: familiarity with cryptographic primitives, zero-knowledge proofs, or incentive design.




What We Offer




A deeply technical atmosphere where complex ideas are pursued, challenged, and refined.
Full remote flexibility within North American time zones.
Competitive compensation with room to focus on open-ended research.
Community-centric culture that prioritizes open-source impact and collaboration.




If you are compelled by research that fuses ML, cryptography, and distributed systems and are eager to work alongside a team with a track record of tackling novel challenges, we would love to hear from you.




Please email a link to a paper or project you have completed (rather than a traditional resume) to team@bagel.net. We look forward to seeing how you think and what you create.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

PermitFlow’s mission is to streamline and simplify construction permitting in the $1.6 trillion United States construction market. Our software reduces time to permit, supporting permitting end-to-end including permit research, application preparation, submission, and monitoring.

We’ve raised a $31m Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from Initialized Capital, Y Combinator, Felicis Ventures, Altos Ventures, and the founders and executives from Zillow, PlanGrid, Thumbtack, Bluebeam, Uber, Procore, and more.

Our team consists of architects, structural engineers, permitting experts, and workflow software specialists, all who have personally experienced the pain of permitting.

📌About The Team

We have a lean but mighty engineering team. We’ve done a lot with a little, but there’s much more work to be done to continue our fast-paced growth and we want you to be a part of that growth. You’ll help us get there by owning end-to-end projects, talking with customers, and ultimately supporting the growth of PermitFlow.

✅ What You’ll Do:

You'll work alongside the CTO and engineering team to develop the first construction permit application and management platform for builders. Our current team consists of engineers from Uber, Amazon, NerdWallet, OnDeck, Harvard, Stanford, and more. We are background and experience agnostic, and we encourage anyone to apply if they are passionate about joining a small team and working to solve a real-world pain point.

We are seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to help build intelligent systems that enhance our permit processing, document understanding, and compliance workflows. You will work on LLM-based models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and AI-driven automation, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to extract, analyze, and structure complex permitting data.


Design, implement, and optimize LLM-powered models for document processing, data extraction, and permit application workflows.
Develop and fine-tune retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines to improve query processing and information retrieval.
Experiment with pre-trained models and fine-tune them for permit-related NLP tasks, such as document classification and entity recognition.
Build scalable machine learning infrastructure, integrating with backend systems to support AI-driven workflows.
Work with large-scale structured and unstructured data to ensure efficient indexing, retrieval, and contextual relevance.
Monitor and improve the performance and scalability of deployed models.
Stay updated with the latest research in LLMs, NLP, retrieval systems, and apply best practices to our AI models.
Collaborate with engineers, product managers, and legal experts to develop AI-native solutions for complex permitting challenges.


🙌 Qualifications & Fit:


3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, ideally in production environments.
Strong understanding of LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face models) and their applications.
Hands-on experience with retrieval systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, FAISS, or vector databases).
Proficiency in Python and common ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
Experience with ML model deployment, monitoring, and scaling in a cloud environment (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work in a fast-paced, high-ownership environment.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

Your models don’t just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you —read on.

AlgaeCal is looking for a top-tier Data Scientist Intern who can turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.




This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we’re driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world’s only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you’ll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.




This job might be for you if you’ve got…

Experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You’ve built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don’t just analyze numbers—you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You’ve used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities.
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that’ll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis.

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.
