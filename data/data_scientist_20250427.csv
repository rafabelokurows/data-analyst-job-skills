What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future

Why we’re hiring for this role

Montamo is on a mission to revolutionize craftsmanship and solve the skilled labor shortage by building the most efficient installation process on the market. We’ve mastered operations through smart processes and software, and our platform, ""Lubo,"" is already transforming how heat pumps are installed and how tradespeople are trained.

But we’re just getting started. To take our operations, academy, and product to the next level, we need an Analytics Engineer who can build and own Montamo’s data stack from scratch. This role will be pivotal in enabling both in-product analytics for our groundbreaking guided installation platform and internal analytics to drive smarter business decisions across operations, talent development, and customer acquisition.

If you’re excited about shaping the data infrastructure of a fast-growing startup that’s redefining craftsmanship—and want to be part of the next big thing in clean energy solutions—this is your chance.

What you'll do

Building Montamo's data foundation from scratch
Design and implement our data infrastructure including pipelines, warehouse, and governance
Create a unified data model that connects installation metrics, training outcomes, and customer journeys
In-product analytics for Lubo
Develop performance dashboards for technicians and operations teams
Identify user behavior patterns to improve our guided installation platform
Work with product to embed actionable insights directly into the technician experience
Internal analytics for business intelligence
Build leadership dashboards tracking KPIs across operations, academy, and customer acquisition
Transform raw operational data into insights that drive smarter decision-making
Enable data-driven optimization of technician scheduling and supply chain
Scale with pragmatism
Implement lightweight solutions that deliver immediate value while supporting future growth
Continuously evolve our data architecture as Montamo expands into new regions and services

Our developing tech stack & practices

While our AI/data stack is just getting started, you’ll have the freedom to shape it using modern tools:


Data pipeline tools: Airflow or dbt (or your preferred choice!)
Data storage: Postgres (for now), Snowflake or BigQuery (as we scale)
Analytics tools: Looker Studio for dashboards; Python/R for deeper analysis
Event tracking: TBD—you’ll help us decide!


We love pragmatic approaches that focus on delivering value fast without compromising quality. You’ll work closely with our software engineering team building Lubo on Next.js/Node.js/Postgres.

You’re Our Match If You


Have 2-4 years of experience shipping AI systems and can navigate full-stack development
Get excited about:
Edge cases of deploying vision models on construction sites
Optimizing RAG pipelines for non-English speakers
Building “good enough now, scalable later” solutions
Can answer these cold: “How would you compress a vision model for offline use on low-end Android devices?” “Explain fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering tradeoffs for multilingual support” “Debug a Next.js API route that’s timing out on GPU-heavy inference”
Bonus superpowers

Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Consumer Analytics At Wolt

As the name Consumer Analytics implies, this team aims to provide reliable data insights that drive informed decision-making, empower Wolt's product organization, and foster a data-driven culture through collaboration and education, ultimately inspiring teams and building value for the Consumer group.

About The Core Experience Team

Core Consumer Experience Analytics team takes care of the core customer journey at Wolt from opening the app to placing the order, including all of the steps in between: browsing, search, in-venue experience, cart and checkout. Data Scientists in this team collaborate closely with product teams, supporting decision-making with insights and experimentation.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect the customer journey at Wolt, we're looking for someone like you!

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
At least 3 years of experience in a Data Analyst or Data Scientist position.
Experience working with product funnels and user journeys.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing (A/B testing), and experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com) or Jaksa Marojevic (jaksa.marojevic@external.wotl.com)

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Staff Machine Learning Research Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics..

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Consumer Analytics At Wolt

As the name Consumer Analytics implies, this team aims to provide reliable data insights that drive informed decision-making, empower Wolt's product organization, and foster a data-driven culture through collaboration and education, ultimately inspiring teams and building value for the Consumer group.

About The Core Experience Team

Core Consumer Experience Analytics team takes care of the core customer journey at Wolt from opening the app to placing the order, including all of the steps in between: browsing, search, in-venue experience, cart and checkout. Data Scientists in this team collaborate closely with product teams, supporting decision-making with insights and experimentation.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect the customer journey at Wolt, we're looking for someone like you!

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
At least 3 years of experience in a Data Analyst or Data Scientist position.
Experience working with product funnels and user journeys.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing (A/B testing), and experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com) or Jaksa Marojevic (jaksa.marojevic@external.wotl.com)

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

First launch was back in 2009. So with over 15 years in the payments industry, we’ve got a story to tell.

Dojo is built to soothe customer and consumer pain points across the world for over 140,000 customers.

And today, there’s over 1000 of us in multiple locations across the UK, Ireland, Spain, and Italy.

Our mission is to empower businesses to thrive in the experience economy by creating the tools and tech that turn transactions into meaningful relationships.

We do that through sophisticated EPOS payments integrations, fast transactions, hospitality bookings, and a strong consumer restaurant app.

The Role

At Dojo, we believe in using data to create products that empower our customers and make a real difference. We're not just focused on the basics like churn prediction — we want to go beyond that and add value to every transaction. Our data team is building solutions that are accessible to businesses of all sizes and industries, helping level the playing field. Thanks to the wealth of data we have and the widespread use of our payment terminals, we're able to make a real impact.

But it's not just about our external customers — we also support our internal teams across the business by providing valuable insights, making predictions, and optimising processes. We're looking for data scientists who are passionate about data, love driving innovation, and want to create meaningful change that benefits both our business and the people we serve.

Hands-on experience with Exploratory Data Analysis, using statistical concepts to drive conclusions and insights.
Experience in building and optimising machine learning models and understanding how to define the right metrics for each unique challenge.
A track record of taking ownership of the full data product lifecycle, from proof of concept to production and ongoing maintenance.
Experience working with large datasets and optimising computations to improve performance.
Familiarity with cloud platforms, especially GCP or AWS, and tools such as Databricks, Git, MLFlow, and DBT.
A customer-centric mindset, with a focus on creating products that solve real problems and make a positive impact.


Dojo home and away

We believe our best work happens when we collaborate in-person. These “together days” foster communication, drive innovation and spark our brightest ideas.

That's why we have an office-first culture. This means working from the office 4+ days per week.

With offices across Europe, we know a thing or two about staying dynamic. Need deep focus? Head to a quiet zone. Big ideas? Collaboration spaces have you covered. Just here for a catch-up? Our social hubs make it easy. Do work that counts, in spaces made for you.

Question: what’s curious, relentless, and customer obsessed?

If you’re keen to know the answer, you’re a third of the way to meeting our Dojo values.

Innovation is the key to solving society's greatest challenges, and IP (intellectual property) plays a pivotal role in encouraging, driving, and capitalising on innovation.




At Ankar AI, our mission is to empower IP and R&D teams with AI tools to innovate more efficiently, thoroughly, and productively.




We are building a platform for inventors to accelerate their work throughout the entire IP lifecycle by providing them with best in class software, leveraging LLMs, for IP search, patent filing, freedom-to-operate analysis and infringement detection.




With the growing complexity and volume of IP today, traditional software is no longer meeting the needs of inventors. Many companies are turning to us to help them stay at the forefront of innovation by cutting through the noise of the millions of patents filed each year.




We believe we are the right team to tackle this problem.

World class team of engineers and product leaders from Palantir, Amazon, Twitter, BCG, and top startups. Together, we have a proven track record of tackling tough problems and delivering mission-driven software.
We are growing rapidly with increasing customer traction. We are already working with the world's most innovative organisations (Fortune 500 companies and top patent filers) to solve critical needs with our product.
We are backed by Tier 1 VCs and Angel Investors, including Index Ventures, co-founders of Hugging Face, CEO of Datadog, and product experts from DeepMind and OpenAI.




We are now growing the team to reach our ambitions. We hire the best and reward accordingly.

Compensation & Equity: We offer competitive compensation and a generous equity package, making you an owner of the company.
Career Growth: You have the opportunity to shape your role, own the impact, grow with the company, and build your skills to accelerate your career at Ankar and beyond.
Meaningful Work: You will have full ownership in tackling challenging problems and help progress innovation in a world that is more and more faced with stagnation. We were founded in early 2024 and you have a real opportunity to shape what we do here.




What you will be doing




Build a first-class AI-enabled platform in a high-ownership environment, where you’ll be leading development across the backend, ML service, ML infrastructure, and data pipelines.
Fine-tune and deploy large language models for patent search, analysis, drafting, and other intellectual property workflows.
Evaluate and improve large language model outputs for quality, relevance, and accuracy.
Develop and optimise search retrievals and ranking models for large-scale patent and technical literature datasets.
Productionise ML models within AWS, including deployment, monitoring, and integration with backend services.




What we are looking for




Has a track record of building world class software. Ideally you have 3+ years of experience building ML applications.
Thrives in a fast-paced & ambiguous environment. You work quickly and iteratively. We work in one-week sprints to ensure we are delivering value and and leading the market.
Seeks ownership. You own your work, approach problems critically, and take pride in what you build. We believe this is the best way to for you to grow and for the product to succeed. We create the environment to help you thrive as an owner.
Wants to work in-person. At this stage of our company, we believe being in the same space enables better communication, quicker decision-making, and fosters a collaborative culture that empowers us to outpace the competition.
[Bonus points] Has experience deploying production ML applications, working with reranking & fine tuning strategies, and/or building large scale content indexing systems.




We believe in people who are driven by curiosity, willing to learn and able to go the extra mile. Please also reach out if you don't exactly ""check all these boxes"".




What else you might want to know




Location: London (no remote)
Contract: Full-time
Compensation: We pay competitive salaries and will reward you with a substantial equity package under the tax-efficient EMI scheme.
Hiring process: (1) 30min introductory chat, (2) 1hr technical interview, (3) 2hr on-site, and (4) 20min final co-founder meeting. The process can be as fast you want it to be.

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.

You will drive innovation by optimising and automating Pricing processes to enable faster, more accurate decision-making. Your work will focus on developing and maintaining tooling and frameworks that enhance the efficiency of our predictive models, reducing deployment times, increasing scalability, and improving model performance through regular updates and monitoring. You will work closely with our Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product team to deliver scalable, production-grade ML systems.




Key Responsibilities

Build model lifecycle tooling (deployment, monitoring and alerting) for our predictive models (for example claims cost, conversion, retention, market models)
Maintain and improve the development environment (Kubeflow) used by our Data Scientists and Actuaries
Develop and maintain pricing analytics tools that enable faster impact assessments, reducing manual work
Collaborate with the technical pricing, street pricing and product teams to gather requirements and feedback on tooling and to build impactful technology
Communicate complex concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders through clear storytelling




Required Skills

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science or related field
Experience: Proven experience in ML model lifecycle management
Core Competencies:
Model lifecycle: You’ve got hands-on experience with managing the ML model lifecycle, including both online and batch processes
Statistical Methodology: You have worked with GLMs and other machine learning algorithms and have in-depth knowledge of how they work
Python: You have built and deployed production-grade Python applications and you are familiar with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
Tooling & Environment:
DevOps: You have experience working with DevOps tooling, such as gitops, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools (we use buildkite) and Docker
Cloud: You have worked with cloud-based environments before (we use AWS)
SQL: You have a good grasp of SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Version control: You are proficient with git
Soft Skills:
You are an excellent communicator, with an ability to translate non-technical requirements into clear, actionable pieces of work
You have proven your project management skills, with the ability to manage multiple priorities
You have worked closely together in cross-functional teams, including with Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product Managers




Nice To Have

Experience in UK motor insurance
Telematics Data: Familiarity with behavioural driving data and its application in insurance pricing
Understanding of pricing modelling tools such as Akur8 or Emblem
Experience with IaC (we use Terraform)
Experience with gRPC/protobuf

We’re spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We’re proud of our company and our culture – a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

Together, we’re setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There’s loads of room to learn and grow, and you’ll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you want.

You’ll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren’t afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we’re making insurance matter.




How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. We think it’s a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.




Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you’ll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. We also offer an annual flexible hybrid working contribution, which you can use to support with your travel to the office or towards your own personal development. And that’s just for starters!

Culture and values

We are guided by our shared values. It's not about finding people who think and act in the same way. These values help to guide our work and will continue to strengthen it.

Thoughtful

Thoughtful at Iso is about curiosity, creativity and care. It is about good people doing good, rigorous and future-making science every single day.

Brave

Brave at Iso is about fearlessness, but it’s also about initiative and integrity. The scale of the challenge demands nothing less.

Determined

Determined at Iso is the way we pursue our goal. It’s a confidence in our hypothesis, as well as the urgency and agility needed to deliver on it. Because disease won’t wait, so neither should we.

Together

Together at Iso is about connection, collaboration across fields and catalytic relationships. It’s knowing that transformation is a group project, and remembering that what we’re doing will have a real impact on real people everywhere.

Creating An Extraordinary Company

We believe that to be successful we need a team with a range of skills and talents. We're building an environment where collaboration is fundamental, learning is shared and every employee feels supported and able to thrive. We value unique experiences, knowledge, backgrounds, and perspectives, and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact.

We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Hybrid working

It’s hugely important for us to share knowledge and build strong relationships with each other, and we find it easier to do this if we spend time together in person. This is why we follow a hybrid model, and would require you to be able to come into the office 3 days a week (currently Tuesday, Wednesday, and one other day depending on which team you’re in). If you have additional needs that would prevent you from following this hybrid approach, we’d be happy to talk through these if you’re selected for an initial screening call.

Please note that when you submit an application, your data will be processed in line with our privacy policy.

How? With a media buying platform that helps brands deliver a more insightful and relevant ad experience for consumers –– and sets a new standard for global reach, accuracy, and transparency. We are proud of the culture we have built. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.

So, if you are talented, driven, creative, and eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team, then we want to talk!

What we do:



Our team is responsible for developing algorithms that run in our real-time bidding platform, with the goal of helping thousands of customers run effective advertising campaigns.
Many of our challenges involve getting machine learning algorithms to work at scale. These challenges include dealing with sparse or noisy labels and data, maintaining low latency, and addressing unreliable ground truth.
Data scientists on our team work closely with Engineering and Product Management throughout the entire product lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and monitoring.


What you'll do:



Our Data Scientists contribute across the product lifecycle, with opportunities to take ownership as they grow. You will participate actively in designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.


Who you are:



You have foundational experience in building models and are eager to learn how to work in large-scale production environments.
You are curious about the ‘why’ behind what you are doing and can anticipate problems that may be several degrees removed.
You have a strong data intuition. At our scale (in the order of millions of bids per seconds), many off-the-shelf modelling techniques may not be suitable. You can work from first principles to develop solutions and adapt them to our unique environment.
You’re curious about how data science contributes to real-world impact and enjoy thinking about how your work affects clients. You have the passion and ability to contribute to discovering what will push forward one of the largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You’re collaborative, open to feedback, and value learning from peers and mentors. Our data scientists grow deep knowledge over time and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You advocate for what you believe is right while being skilled at identifying and evaluating trade-offs and being open to being proven wrong.
You value, seek out and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ‘the way things have always been done’. What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate.
You bring enthusiasm to the team and look for opportunities to contribute and grow in a supportive environment.


What you bring to the table

We do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start at TTD. What we care most about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job. However, we find that the most successful candidates typically come in with something like the following experience:



Some hands-on experience (through work, internships, or projects) in applying data science to real-world problems.
Technical proficiency with Python and/or Scala and big-data technologies such as Spark, combined with the ability to work independently and navigate technical ambiguity.
Intellectual curiosity, with a commitment to self-improvement and continuous learning, alongside effective communication of progress and challenges to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Comfortable working in an agile, distributed team environment, proactively seeking feedback, understanding the rationale behind tasks, and the contribution to key performance indicators and operational efficiency.


The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local law.

We are developing a next-gen integration platform that allows SaaS businesses of any size to integrate their product with third-party products in a fast, powerful, and secure way.

🎖️ Our vision

The number of SaaS companies is exploding. But making great integrations is still too expensive and slow. We are building StackOne to solve this and become the platform that powers a connected ecosystem of apps that customers love.

💪 Well-funded and backed by top-tier angels and VCs, we're now growing extremely rapidly and we are currently raising a multi-million dollar round. We're seeking talented and driven individuals who can help us achieve our vision and continue to grow the product and the overall company at a record pace.

About The Role

We are looking for a Software Engineer or Data/AI Scientist with a strong background in AI production-grade applications with strong experience with LLM models (eg: GPT, Anthropic and others).

In this role, you will conduct research and development around AI, focusing on automating processes and development at StackOne. We're building a world where users of any SaaS can integrate with the tool of their choice in one click thanks to StackOne. We're convinced AI is pivotal to making this a reality by transforming how SaaS talks to each other and this is what you will help achieve.

Responsibilities


Research, design, and develop AI models using or training existing or bespoke LLM models (and other AI tech) to improve and automate API & more generally SaaS interactions.
Managing and updating Data pipelines used for AI use-cases
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify opportunities for AI integration and automation
Optimize and refine existing AI models and applications for performance and scalability
Stay current with advancements in AI and LLM technologies, applying new knowledge to StackOne's AI strategy
Implement best practices in AI development, ensuring compliance with data privacy and security regulations
Document and communicate research findings and development progress to stakeholders
Collaborate with other software & AI engineer(s) to deliver larger scale projects


Requirements


Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field (or 3+ years of relevant experience)
Familiarity with API development, integration, and SaaS platforms
Past experience with AI, specifically Large Language Models and related technologies
Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills
Strong communication and collaboration abilities
Desire to work in a fast-paced, dynamic startup environment


Preferable


You’re familiar with Typescript
You’ve deployed or managed infrastructure on AWS


⚡️ Our Stack

You Will Have a Lot Of Freedom And Agency To Chose And Work With The Technologies You Love. Our Tech Stack Includes


Infra & monitoring: AWS (ECS, RDS, Elasticache, Lambda etc.), Tinybird, Modal, Dagster, Langsmith, Datadog, Sentry, Incident.io
Languages & Frameworks: Typescript (Node.js), NestJS, Rails, React, Svelte,
Other day-to-day Tools: Postman, Notion, Slack, Jira, Github and more


🚀 Product

StackOne is one of the fastest-growing embedded integration platforms. Here’s why:


It drives down the cost of building integrations by 10x. To add dozens of integrations, you only need to integrate once with our unified API and we take care of the rest. This is way faster, cheaper, and more reliable than building every integration to each tool one at a time (it can take weeks/months per integration).
It has a superior architecture: Unlike other Unified APIs, we developed an innovative, fully real-time architecture that does not store their customers’ sensitive data by default. This enables our customers to differentiate themselves on the market with better integrations: better for privacy, better for their product’s user experience, and deeper read/write integrations.
StackOne is a better long-term partner: We are the only integration platform to guarantee new integrations as standard, that offers so many sandboxes to support testing and deploying faster, and that has built a strong partnership ecosystem to enable our customers to develop stronger commercial partnerships.


😎 Why join us?


Join one of Europe’s fastest-growing startups
Work with a veteran team of ex-employees of Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Coinbase, JP Morgan and more
Participation in the company’s employee share options plan
25 days holiday + 1 additional day holiday per year of tenure
Flexible work setup - we're hybrid-friendly
£1,000 for your home office set up + £500/year top-up
Cycle2Work and Electric Cars scheme
Private health insurance (including dental & optical)
Health, fitness and gift card discounts
Annual team offsite to sunny spots (last ones were in Spain and Portugal ☀️)

You will also be required to develop and run key stages of our bioinformatics pipelines, streamline data workflows and maintain accurate, up-to-date records in our ELN platform.




Success in this role will require strong teamwork and communication skills, as you will work closely with cross-functional teams across all levels of the organisation. Attention to detail is critical for executing bioinformatics scripts, maintaining accurate records, and ensuring accurate reporting. Given the dynamic nature of a small company, your adaptability and problem-solving skills will be key, as well as a curious and proactive mindset to seek advice and take ownership of areas for improvement.




Role profile

Curate and organise experimental datasets, ensuring they are properly structured and uploaded into the company’s data repositories
Generate graphs, data visualisations, and summary reports to facilitate the interpretation of both experimental and in silico data.
Execute and optimise bioinformatics scripts for in silico developability assessments, antibody sequence clustering and viral/Ig phylogenetics
Prepare antibody sequences, data tables, and supporting documents for patent submissions, publications and business development
Provide general bioinformatics and data management support, troubleshooting technical challenges related to data processing and analysis
Collaborate closely with other bioinformaticians and experimental scientists at RQ Bio, contributing to cross-functional research efforts




Essential skills and experience

Degree in biological sciences, preferably immunology or virology
Master’s degree or equivalent experience in bioinformatics / computational biology
Proficiency in Python and/or R for biological data analysis, statistical modelling, and data visualisation
Communication of complex information to both technical and non-specialist audiences
Enthusiastic attitude and eagerness to learn and implement new skills and technologies




Desirable skills and experience

Familiarity with bash scripting and command-line tools for data processing
Understanding of antibody sequence analysis, structure prediction tools, and developability assessments
Ability to troubleshoot bioinformatics pipelines and workflow automation
Familiarity with electronic lab notebook (ELN) platforms e.g. Benchling
Knowledge of humoral immunology, next-generation sequencing and infectious diseases
Relevant experience working at, or collaborating with, biotech companies




Working arrangements and benefits

The position can be hybrid, with an on-site presence required for at least 1 day per week at RQ Bio’s laboratories at Scale Space in the White City area of London. Some after-hours work may be required occasionally
We offer a competitive salary, commensurate with qualifications and experience, and a benefits package including pension and health insurance
Candidates must have the right to work in the UK, or eligibility to obtain it
We believe diverse teams are the most innovative, and welcome applications from all backgrounds and identities

The Data & Science Org

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a Data Scientist At Deliveroo, Your Main Goal Is To Maximise Business Impact Within One Of Many Business Areas. You Will Help Answer Questions Like


Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?


The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements


A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems


Why Deliveroo Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed

Innovation is the key to solving society's greatest challenges, and IP (intellectual property) plays a pivotal role in encouraging, driving, and capitalising on innovation.




At Ankar AI, our mission is to empower IP and R&D teams with AI tools to innovate more efficiently, thoroughly, and productively.




We are building a platform for inventors to accelerate their work throughout the entire IP lifecycle by providing them with best in class software, leveraging LLMs, for IP search, patent filing, freedom-to-operate analysis and infringement detection.




With the growing complexity and volume of IP today, traditional software is no longer meeting the needs of inventors. Many companies are turning to us to help them stay at the forefront of innovation by cutting through the noise of the millions of patents filed each year.




We believe we are the right team to tackle this problem.

World class team of engineers and product leaders from Palantir, Amazon, Twitter, BCG, and top startups. Together, we have a proven track record of tackling tough problems and delivering mission-driven software.
We are growing rapidly with increasing customer traction. We are already working with the world's most innovative organisations (Fortune 500 companies and top patent filers) to solve critical needs with our product.
We are backed by Tier 1 VCs and Angel Investors, including Index Ventures, co-founders of Hugging Face, CEO of Datadog, and product experts from DeepMind and OpenAI.




We are now growing the team to reach our ambitions. We hire the best and reward accordingly.

Compensation & Equity: We offer competitive compensation and a generous equity package, making you an owner of the company.
Career Growth: You have the opportunity to shape your role, own the impact, grow with the company, and build your skills to accelerate your career at Ankar and beyond.
Meaningful Work: You will have full ownership in tackling challenging problems and help progress innovation in a world that is more and more faced with stagnation. We were founded in early 2024 and you have a real opportunity to shape what we do here.




What you will be doing




Build a first-class AI-enabled platform in a high-ownership environment, where you’ll be leading development across the backend, ML service, ML infrastructure, and data pipelines.
Fine-tune and deploy large language models for patent search, analysis, drafting, and other intellectual property workflows.
Evaluate and improve large language model outputs for quality, relevance, and accuracy.
Develop and optimise search retrievals and ranking models for large-scale patent and technical literature datasets.
Productionise ML models within AWS, including deployment, monitoring, and integration with backend services.




What we are looking for




Has a track record of building world class software. Ideally you have 3+ years of experience building ML applications.
Thrives in a fast-paced & ambiguous environment. You work quickly and iteratively. We work in one-week sprints to ensure we are delivering value and and leading the market.
Seeks ownership. You own your work, approach problems critically, and take pride in what you build. We believe this is the best way to for you to grow and for the product to succeed. We create the environment to help you thrive as an owner.
Wants to work in-person. At this stage of our company, we believe being in the same space enables better communication, quicker decision-making, and fosters a collaborative culture that empowers us to outpace the competition.
[Bonus points] Has experience deploying production ML applications, working with reranking & fine tuning strategies, and/or building large scale content indexing systems.




We believe in people who are driven by curiosity, willing to learn and able to go the extra mile. Please also reach out if you don't exactly ""check all these boxes"".




What else you might want to know




Location: London (no remote)
Contract: Full-time
Compensation: We pay competitive salaries and will reward you with a substantial equity package under the tax-efficient EMI scheme.
Hiring process: (1) 30min introductory chat, (2) 1hr technical interview, (3) 2hr on-site, and (4) 20min final co-founder meeting. The process can be as fast you want it to be.

Note: We want Arondite to bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We don't expect everyone to have experience across each of these areas. Please apply even if you only partially fulfil this list.

Security clearance

We believe in working closely with defence customers. As a result, this role is likely to require you to hold a clearance or be willing to undergo UK security vetting to Security Check (SC) or above. This normally requires having continuous residency in the UK for at least 5 years.

Office vs hybrid working

We are focused on building a positive, collaborative engineering-driven culture. We therefore believe in making the office a friendly, comfortable and fun place to be, and we try to work from the office where possible. Of course, there are times when it makes sense for you to work from home and that's OK. You may also need to travel to visit customers, depending on your role. But in general you should only apply to join Arondite if you're excited to come into the office and work in person by default.

Application process

Generally, our interview process is comprised of the following stages:


CV submission with initial questions
Introductory Teams call (30 mins)
In-person technical interview (1-2 hours)
Final interview with one of Arondite's Founders (30 mins)

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$142,400 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.




Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. For over five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck, Rakovina Therapeutics, and ImmVue Therapeutics.




You will help identify, clean, prepare, and test datasets; run experiments to evaluate new architectures and tune hyperparameters; continually improve the robustness and efficiency of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. In this process, you will have the opportunity to build your skills by collaborating with our team of accomplished ML scientists and chemists. Software engineering expertise is required, as well as experience with deep learning and generative models; knowledge of chemistry and pharmacology is preferred be not required.




Here is the background we’re looking for:

M.S. (Ph.D. preferred) in CS, applied mathematics, statistics, physics, or related discipline;
Experience with machine learning techniques, including diffusion models, Transformers, and Bayesian optimization, preferably demonstrated through peer-reviewed publications;

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$142,400 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Support Experience engineering team builds and improves Stripe’s user support from end to end: how users get help within our products, how they get in touch with us when they have questions, and how our teams use internal tools to answer those questions. We’re accountable for the quality and reliability of this support stack and we use data and firsthand user research to continuously improve it.

Providing great support to users of all sizes is culturally important to everyone at Stripe. We are a group of friendly, user-oriented engineers that partner closely with Stripe’s world-class design, product, and operational teams. This includes the external-facing support interfaces (support.stripe.com), content, entry points, internal tooling, case routing, and helping product teams across the company reduce support volume by improving our products. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine support experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive.

What you’ll do

As a Machine Learning Engineer on the Support Experience team, you'll play a crucial role in enhancing our self-serve support experiences. You will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production. For example, we apply LLMs to answer user questions with conversational agents and personalize product documentation, and are building automated systems to solve complex user problems. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers, product managers, and data scientists to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Design and implement state-of-the-art ML models and large scale ML systems for enhancing self-serve support capabilities, balancing ML principles, domain knowledge, and engineering constraints
Develop and optimize contextual conversation models and ML-powered resolution flows for common support scenarios, using tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and XGBoost
Create and refine pipelines for training and evaluating models in both offline and online environments, with a focus on improving support quality and user satisfaction
Implement ML features that streamline information collection and processing for support agents, enhancing overall support efficiency
Collaborate with product, strategy, and content teams to propose, prioritize, and implement new AI-driven support features and improve answer capabilities
Stay current with the latest developments in ML/AI, particularly in natural language processing and conversational AI, and apply innovative ideas to improve support experiences



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about building ML systems that touch the lives of millions. You have experience developing efficient feature pipelines, building advanced ML models, and deploying them to production. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, have a bias towards action, and thrive in a collaborative environment.

Minimum Requirements


Bachelor's Degree in ML/AI or related field (e.g. math, physics, statistics)
You have a strong technical background, including 7+ years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Proficient with ML libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, as well as Spark
Knowledge of various ML algorithms and model architectures
Hands-on experience in designing, training, evaluating & productionizing machine learning models at scale



Preferred Qualifications


MS/PhD degree in ML/AI or related field (e.g. math, physics, statistics)
Previous leadership or mentorship experience
Previous experience building ML solutions focused on support
Experience with LLMs and prompt engineering
Comfortable working with distributed teams across multiple locations and time zones
Proven track record of building and deploying ML systems that have effectively solved ambiguous business problems

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

Spring Financial is revolutionizing financial access for Canadians, providing smart credit-building, mortgage, and lending solutions. Millions struggle with high-interest debt and limited financial options—we’re here to change that.

As one of Canada’s fastest-growing fintech companies, annually we help 1 million customers explore their financing options with ease—online, via text, or over the phone. Our dynamic, innovative team thrives on collaboration, growth, and making a real impact.

To learn more about our products please visit our website here: www.springfinancial.ca.

NOTE: This is a full-time, permanent, hybrid position in downtown Vancouver, with 3 set days in the office and 2 WFH.

Job Overview

As a Machine Learning Engineer II, you independently design, build, and maintain machine learning systems that deliver impact for our customers and business. You are responsible for deploying reliable, scalable solutions — from credit scoring models to intelligent automation and LLM-powered features. You work across the stack to connect ML systems with real user value.

You own end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and transformation to model training, validation, and online inference. You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

What You’ll Do


Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $120,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more. Due to high application volume, we may not be able to respond to everyone.

Thank you for your interest! We appreciate your time and look forward to reviewing your application!

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.
