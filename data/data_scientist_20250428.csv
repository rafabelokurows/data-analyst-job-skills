We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.

Lila Sciences is a privately held, early-stage technology company pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to transform every aspect of the scientific method. Lila Sciences is backed by Flagship Pioneering, which brings the courage, long-term vision, and resources needed to realize unreasonable results. Join our mission-driven team and contribute to the future of science.

We are leveraging AI across both Life Sciences and Physical Sciences to transform the process of invention and discovery,

At Lila Sciences, we are uniquely cross-functional and collaborative. We are actively reimagining the way teams work together and communicate. Therefore, we seek individuals with an inclusive mindset and a diversity of thought. Our teams thrive in unstructured and creative environments. All voices are heard because we know that experience comes in many forms, skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

The Role

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

Candidates should have experience and/or interest in some or all of:


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


Qualifications:


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


Working at Lila, you would have access to advanced technology in the areas of:


AI experimental design and simulation
Automated custom instrumentation
Generative molecular and material design

Full-time / Onsite (5 days/week)

About The Role

We’re a telehealth company helping people lose weight at scale. Our internal team is core to delivering care—but scaling care delivery is messy, complex, and full of hidden inefficiencies. We’re looking for a Data Scientist who thrives on turning operational chaos into clarity. As a data scientist at Mochi Health, you’ll have the opportunity to work with and support various departments from marketing to operations. You’ll combine analytical thinking with engineering pragmatism—owning dashboards, automating workflows, uncovering bottlenecks, and building internal tools that let our team move faster with less friction. This role is ideal for someone who wants impact, autonomy, and real-world complexity.

What You’ll Do


Own the full lifecycle of operational metrics—from KPI design to dashboard deployment and stakeholder adoption.
Design metrics that drive accountability, surface inefficiencies, and guide automation.
Automate high-friction workflows using Python, APIs, and lightweight tools.
Integrate Generative AI and LLMs to optimize and augment workflows.
Apply causal inference, forecasting, or A/B testing where necessary.
Choose the right surface for delivery—Tableau, Streamlit, Google Sheets—based on context and audience.


Who You Are


Bachelor’s or Master’s in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering).
2+ years of experience using data to solve product, marketing, or business problems.
Strong Python and SQL skills; write clean, maintainable code.
Experienced in building dashboards (e.g. Tableau) and internal tools (e.g. Streamlit).
Curious, self-directed, and impact-driven—you chase high-leverage problems.
Clear communicator who can simplify the complex for any audience.
Comfortable with ambiguity and switching contexts in a fast-moving environment.

Since its start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World's Most Experienced Driver™—to improve access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, a fully autonomous ride-hailing service, and can also be applied to a range of vehicle platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has provided over one million rider-only trips, enabled by its experience autonomously driving tens of millions of miles on public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 13+ U.S. states.

Rigorous performance evaluation of the Waymo Driver is a critical part of scaling our ride hailing service and achieving Waymo’s audacious goals. Waymo data scientists work hand-in-hand with engineering teams at each stage of the software development cycle, employing statistical models and developing metrics and measurement frameworks to ensure that the Waymo Driver meets our strict standards for safety, compliance, and driving and service quality. Autonomous driving presents a new paradigm in data science: in addition to leveraging data collected on-road, we generate our own data using state-of-the-art simulation technology—resulting in denser signals and challenging new problems in estimation and experimental design.

In this hybrid role you will report to a Data Science Manager.

You Will


Develop evaluation frameworks for autonomous vehicle performance, for large-scale ML models, and for the quality of simulation.
Develop new metrics, interpret trends, and investigate anomalies in data from simulation and on-road driving.
Develop novel statistical methods to handle unique aspects of AV data; e.g. rate estimation with rare events, combining real and synthetic data, etc.
Frame and solve ambiguous problems, derive data-driven conclusions, and communicate findings to senior stakeholders.
Collaborate with Product and Engineering partners developing the Waymo Driver and Waymo’s simulation software; facilitate deployment readiness decisions for both products.


You Have

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

As our Data Scientist for Go-to-Market, you will be a key business partner to our Sales and Revenue Operations team. Your work will be instrumental in shaping our data strategy as we design and implement a best-in-class Go-to-Market motion.

Each day will bring new challenges and opportunities to drive meaningful change with data.

What You'll Achieve


You will partner with Revenue Operations and Sales leads, driving forward all data science and analytics work in their functional areas
You will transform complex data into compelling insights, synthesizing them into crisp narratives for senior leadership that drive measurable business change (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
You will build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for critical decision-making, along with self-service tools that empower business partners
You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing sales outreach strategies or building a sales forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for GTM analytics



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Revenue Operations, Finance, Growth, Marketing
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy



Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Sales, Customer Success, Revenue Operations, and/or Finance teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)

We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

Build & Deploy Safely on OpenShift AI: Design, develop, containerize, and deploy AI-powered features and models using Red Hat OpenShift AI components (e.g., Workbenches, Model Registry, Pipelines), ensuring alignment with responsible AI principles and safety requirements from the outset.
Integrate & Vet AI Services: Leverage and critically evaluate open-source models (e.g., Granite), integrating them safely, securely, and responsibly within applications running on OpenShift. Assess models for potential biases and safety risks before integration.
Master AI Safety & OpenShift Toolkits: Utilize AI engineering frameworks, vector databases, and specific tools within OpenShift AI for AI safety, explainability, bias detection, development, serving, monitoring, and automation of the AI system lifecycle.
Design & Implement Guardrails: Design, implement, and test robust safety guardrails for AI interactions, including input validation, prompt safety techniques, output content filtering, and oversight mechanisms for RAG patterns. Automate these checks using OpenShift Pipelines and GitOps practices where applicable.
Manage Models with MLOps & Safety: Utilize (and sometimes contribute to building) models and leverage OpenShift AI Serving technologies to deploy, manage versions, and continuously monitor for performance, safety metrics, bias, and drift, ensuring the reliability and ethical operation of AI models in production.
Evaluate Holistically: Focus on product-specific evaluation of AI models and approaches, rigorously assessing their performance, safety, fairness, bias, robustness, cost, and adherence to ethical guidelines within the OpenShift environment.
Stay Current on Safety & AI: Keep pace with advancements in the general AI landscape (models, techniques), especially emerging threats, mitigation techniques, AI safety research, and relevant regulatory landscapes, alongside OpenShift AI platform features.
Collaborate for Trust: Work closely with product managers, application developers, platform engineers, data scientists, and relevant governance/ethics/security teams to integrate AI capabilities smoothly, ensuring systems are trustworthy, compliant, and adhere to enterprise standards.


Who You Are


A Safety-Conscious Builder with Platform Sense: You have a strong software engineering background (Python proficiency is key, Java is a plus), understand containerization (Docker, Podman), Kubernetes/OpenShift fundamentals, and prioritize building secure and safe systems.
AI Practitioner Aware of Risks: You actively experiment with Foundation Models (LLMs, etc.), understand how to apply them practically, and are keenly aware of their potential risks, limitations, and ethical considerations.
OpenShift AI Familiar: You have hands-on experience with Red Hat OpenShift AI / OpenShift Data Science and its core components (Model Serving, Pipelines, Workbenches). Understanding of MLOps concepts is essential.
Tool-Savvy with a Safety Lens: You’re familiar with the AI engineering stack (LLama Stack, LangChain, Vector DBs, etc.) and are eager to apply or learn tools/techniques specifically for AI safety, explainability, and bias mitigation within an OpenShift context.
Pragmatic & Responsible: You focus on building useful, reliable AI features, with a strong commitment to responsible AI development, deployment, and minimizing potential harm.
Fast Learner: You thrive in the fast-paced AI field and are comfortable continuously learning new platform features, AI techniques, and safety best practices.
Not Necessarily an ML PhD: Your strength lies in applying, deploying, and safeguarding AI models effectively using platform tools, rather than deep theoretical research. Practical experience is paramount.


Nice-to-Haves


Experience implementing AI safety techniques (e.g., input/output filtering, adversarial testing, bias detection/mitigation, explainability methods like LIME/SHAP).
Direct experience deploying various types of ML models (including LLMs) using OpenShift AI Model Serving (KServe/Caikit/TGIS) with integrated safety checks.

Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.  Role Overview Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.  Role Overview Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery. Key Responsibilities
Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.
Assist in the conception, development, optimization, and assessment of machine-learning models for understanding the T-cell receptor-peptide-MHC interface.
Work alongside computer science engineers, wet-lab scientists, and project managers, contributing to early discovery, lead identification, lead optimization, and biomarker development.
Maintain familiarity with scientific literature to assist in the development and benchmarking of new methods.
Communicate findings both internally and externally via presentations and publication.
  Qualifications/Experience
