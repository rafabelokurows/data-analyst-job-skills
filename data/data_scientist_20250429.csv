Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

At Pallon, a spin-off from ETH Zurich, we’re creating AI that automatically detects defects in sewer inspection videos and advises cities on when & how to fix them. By providing more precise, objective data, we aim to fix wastewater leaks, reduce CO2 emissions, and prevent urban flooding. Our mission is to make cities more sustainable and resilient.

The Role

This is a hands-on, high-impact role. You’ll make decisions on model selection, system architecture, and performance tradeoffs, while also diving deep into the code and data — whether that’s reading research papers, optimizing GPU training performance, debugging a tricky edge case, or reviewing videos to understand the remaining failure cases.

In this role, you will:


Research and develop computer vision methods for scene understanding (like 3D reconstruction, SLAM, object detection, segmentation) to solve real-world problems.
Work hands-on to turn your research into robust, production-ready code.
Help improve how we do research, design software, and maintain code quality.
Share your knowledge and help mentor other engineers on the team.


Requirements

We are looking for candidates with:


Either: a PhD focused on Machine Learning or Computer Vision with publications at well-known conferences.
Or: 5+ years of industry experience taking Machine Learning projects from research to production, coupled with a degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, or similar.


Successful candidates will also demonstrate:


Strong collaborative and communication skills, contributing to an environment of mutual learning.
The ability to work independently but know when to team up or ask questions.
Solid software engineering experience building real-world systems as part of a team.


Our Tech Stack

You don’t need to have experience with all of this — but here’s what we use today:


Deep Learning: Python, Pytorch
Computer Vision: C++, OpenCV, Ceres, Eigen
Infrastructure: Slurm, our GPU cluster, Kubernetes, Docker


Read more about our Computer Vision team here.

Benefits & Team Culture

As a part of Pallon, you will:


Contribute to a positive impact on society and the environment.
Develop a novel product that changes a whole industry.
Be part of a motivated, smart, fun, and supportive team of software engineers and AI researchers.
Own a part of Pallon and have a part in our success with our Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP).
Work for the Underworld, not the Devil: exploring sewers virtually and in real life during our Pallon offsites.
Work from home or enjoy access to our beautiful office space located in Zürich.


Inclusion statement

At Pallon, we highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability and ESG teams on the frontlines of solving the climate crisis.




We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients—including some of the world's largest firms—we’re already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.




Backed by €7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We’re based at the heart of Europe’s AI revolution—the AI Campus in Berlin—where we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.


Your role


As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to accelerate transition to a sustainable planet. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as exploring new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.





Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.


Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.


Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs and ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring how AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.


Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction and helps achieve our mission.



Your profile

What type of person we're looking for...



Knowledgable and experienced with building AI/LLM products: You have strong knowledge and experience of thinking through and building AI/LLM systems from prototyping and experiments through to deployment, evaluation, monitoring and improvement in production.


Practical Implementer: You are a ‘builder’ and aim to pragmatically integrate AI into real-world products, moving beyond research to create tangible, impactful solutions.


Personal agency and drive: must have personal agency, drive and ability to figure things out, learn and iterate to drive initiatives forward to success.


Innovative Thinker: You're driven by curiosity and continually experiment with new models, techniques and technologies in the rapidly evolving AI/LLM space.


Excellent Communicator: You have outstanding verbal and written communication skills in English, and can build strong relationships with internal teams and external partners.


Collaborative and Organised: You thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve success. Preferably with experience in start-ups.


Passion for ESG and Sustainability: You are motivated by using your skills to help address climate change and enthusiastic about building tools that help ESG and sustainability teams.



Technical Skills



Minimum of 4 years of experience: As an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI/ML Product Engineer or related roles.


Fluency in python: Including strong proficiency with base python as well as modern frameworks (e.g. fastAPI)


Experience with LLMs: Including core concepts around foundation models, prompt engineering and chains etc. as well as preferably some experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain). Experience using LLMs to build RAG systems and/or other real-world use-cases related to document processing would be a major bonus.


Experience with LLM evaluation: Including how to collect labelled data and systematically evaluate RAG and other real world LLM applications, preferably with experience in evaluation tools and frameworks (e.g. Langsmith)


Experience with production grade applications: Including familiarity with software development tools and practices for production applications (e.g git, CI/CD, containerization) and preferably some experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment (e.g. GCP, Modal). Any experience with cost/latency implications of deploying LLMs at scale would be a major bonus.


Fluency in English: With the ability to clearly communicate complex topics to diverse stakeholders. Any other European language would be a bonus.


Understanding or interest in sustainability: Including an interest in sustainability climate, or ESG topics and a desire to use your skills to help accelerate the climate transition.
Even if your experience doesn’t align precisely with all the criteria, we encourage you to apply. Many people miss out on opportunities because they feel they don’t fit every requirement—we believe in growth, not perfection!



What we offer



Competitive Remuneration: As a core member of our team, you will receive a competitive salary and equity package, reflecting your role in shaping Briink’s future.


Purpose-Driven Mission: ESG data has the power to create a more sustainable world, but today it presents more challenges than solutions. We believe AI can change that. Be part of the transition to an AI-powered, sustainable world.


Flexible Working: Our work philosophy is built on flexibility. While we do like to come to the office (in Berlin or London) to collaborate in person, this is a hybrid role with opportunities for some remote work within European time zones.


Trust and Ownership: At Briink, we empower you to own your projects with the option for growing into new roles. We believe in giving people autonomy and trust to drive your own initiatives.


Dynamic Work Environment: Based at the Merantix AI Campus, Berlin’s hub for AI innovation, you’ll work in a diverse, collaborative environment. With frequent events and opportunities for cross-company collaboration, you’ll be part of a thriving ecosystem of AI startups and experts.


Learning budget and quarterly hackathons: We truly believe in the importance of curiosity and experimentation as both a learning opportunity and strategic advantage. We therefore have a learning budget to explore new technologies and regular hackathons to prototype new ideas.

Job Introduction

The BBC has been serving audiences online for more than 20 years. Across key products including BBC iPlayer, News, Sport, Weather and Sounds, we entertain, educate and inform audiences in their millions every day.

We are creating personalised content, products and services that bring the right content, to the right people, at the right time - a personalised BBC. This will be our greatest leap since iPlayer, and that’s why it’s right at the top of our agenda.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.




Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.




Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.




As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:





Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.




Requirements





A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact


Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems





Why DeliverooOur mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders.

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

Clinical and pre-clinical researchers at King’s have access to a state-of-the art core facilities and expertise, including multimodality in vivo imaging, clinical research facilities, experimental medicine hub, high-throughput robotic screening, comprehensive 3 genomics/proteomics/metabolomics/single cell analyses, integrative invasive and non-invasive human physiology, comprehensive murine physiology and genetic modification, etc. There is an innovative clinical informatics platform integrated with large language models for the analyses of electronic health records across the King’s Health Partner NHS Trusts. Assisted by the close collaboration between clinical and academic colleagues and the outstanding infrastructure, all the building blocks are in place for the generation of novel advances with major clinical impact. The School hosts a range of training programmes including three PhD programmes in cardiovascular sciences and advanced therapies, an MSc in Cardiovascular Sciences and an iBSc in Cardiovascular Medicine. Multiple other doctoral training programmes are available across the Faculty.

About The Role

The postholder will contribute to development of our portfolio of clinical and health informatics platforms and research which sits within the King’s BHF Centre of Research Excellence (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/scms/bhf-centre) and specifically work within the Coronary Research Group at KCL.

The Coronary Research Group carries out translational research into the mechanisms and consequences of cardiac ischaemia with a view to developing and evaluating novel and personalised treatments for ischaemic heart disease. The group employs diverse research methodologies to achieve these aims, from exploration of the pathophysiological basis of disease states by detailed characterisation of patients during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through designing and conducting multicentre randomised clinical trials to applying machine learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to data extracted from routine health records. The work will also include areas relevant to the BHF Centre Themes including heart failure, obesity and metabolic diseases with the scope of extending the timeframe of the contract based on the receipt of renewed funding. The Group’s research is funded by peer-reviewed grants from charities (including the Academy of Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation and Medical Research Council) and public funding (UK National Institute for Health Research and US National Institute for Health) as well as investigator-initiated commercial funding.

The primary purpose of this role is to develop a cohort identification tool for cardiovascular research using multimodal electronic health records data. This will require the development of both the tool itself and a number of clinical phenotyping algorithms. This new tool will be part of the CogStack ecosystem, currently being deployed to multiple hospitals for near real-time analytics for direct patient care, streamlining services and research ([](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299; https://cogstack.github.io/). A key component of this system is our clinical NLP tool MedCAT ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10166; https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT).

The role will build clinical NLP and phenotyping using electronic health records, putting these tools in the hands of clinical users. As such this tool is a foundational piece of work to enable a multitude of subsequent projects and grant applications which use this software to identify a cohort of patients from the EHR.

This is a 50% FTE post (17.5 hours per week), and you will be offered a fixed term contract for 8 months.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.




Who we're looking for

We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to play a key role in our Core Pricing team. You will drive innovation by optimising and automating Pricing processes to enable faster, more accurate decision-making.

You will work closely with our Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product team to deliver scalable, production-grade ML systems.




Key Responsibilities

Build model lifecycle tooling (deployment, monitoring and alerting) for our predictive models (for example claims cost, conversion, retention, market models)
Maintain and improve the development environment (Kubeflow) used by our Data Scientists and Actuaries
Develop and maintain pricing analytics tools that enable faster impact assessments, reducing manual work
Collaborate with the technical pricing, street pricing and product teams to gather requirements and feedback on tooling and to build impactful technology
Communicate complex concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders through clear storytelling




Required Skills

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science or related field
Experience: Proven experience in ML model lifecycle management
Core Competencies:

Statistical Methodology: You have worked with GLMs and other machine learning algorithms and have in-depth knowledge of how they work
Python: You have built and deployed production-grade Python applications and you are familiar with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
Tooling & Environment:
DevOps: You have experience working with DevOps tooling, such as gitops, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools (we use buildkite) and Docker
Cloud: You have worked with cloud-based environments before (we use AWS)
SQL: You have a good grasp of SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Version control: You are proficient with git
Soft Skills:
You are an excellent communicator, with an ability to translate non-technical requirements into clear, actionable pieces of work
You have proven your project management skills, with the ability to manage multiple priorities
You have worked closely together in cross-functional teams, including with Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product Managers

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.




Vertex Search is acting as a recruitment agency on this assignment.

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.

The School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine & Sciences (Head, Professor Mauro Giacca) provides an outstanding multi-disciplinary environment for the pursuit of cutting-edge cardiovascular and metabolic research . Our current research spans the fundamental molecular, cellular, and physiological processes that underly normal and abnormal cardiovascular and metabolic function and drive the translation of this strong basic science into advances in clinical practice. The School occupies facilities across the Guy’s, St Thomas’ and Denmark Hill campuses of King’s College London and comprises over 70 clinical and non-clinical academic groups, hosting 400 personnel and 110 PhD students. Clinical and pre-clinical researchers at King’s have access to a state-of-the art core facilities and expertise, including multimodality in vivo imaging, clinical research facilities, experimental medicine hub, high-throughput robotic screening, comprehensive 3 genomics/proteomics/metabolomics/single cell analyses, integrative invasive and non-invasive human physiology, comprehensive murine physiology and genetic modification, etc. There is an innovative clinical informatics platform integrated with large language models for the analyses of electronic health records across the King’s Health Partner NHS Trusts. Assisted by the close collaboration between clinical and academic colleagues and the outstanding infrastructure, all the building blocks are in place for the generation of novel advances with major clinical impact. The School hosts a range of training programmes including three PhD programmes in cardiovascular sciences and advanced therapies, an MSc in Cardiovascular Sciences and an iBSc in Cardiovascular Medicine. Multiple other doctoral training programmes are available across the Faculty.

About The Role

The postholder will contribute to development of our portfolio of clinical and health informatics platforms and research which sits within the King’s BHF Centre of Research Excellence (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/scms/bhf-centre) and specifically work within the Coronary Research Group at KCL.

The Coronary Research Group carries out translational research into the mechanisms and consequences of cardiac ischaemia with a view to developing and evaluating novel and personalised treatments for ischaemic heart disease. The group employs diverse research methodologies to achieve these aims, from exploration of the pathophysiological basis of disease states by detailed characterisation of patients during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through designing and conducting multicentre randomised clinical trials to applying machine learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to data extracted from routine health records. The work will also include areas relevant to the BHF Centre Themes including heart failure, obesity and metabolic diseases with the scope of extending the timeframe of the contract based on the receipt of renewed funding. The Group’s research is funded by peer-reviewed grants from charities (including the Academy of Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation and Medical Research Council) and public funding (UK National Institute for Health Research and US National Institute for Health) as well as investigator-initiated commercial funding.

The primary purpose of this role is to develop a cohort identification tool for cardiovascular research using multimodal electronic health records data. This will require the development of both the tool itself and a number of clinical phenotyping algorithms. This new tool will be part of the CogStack ecosystem, currently being deployed to multiple hospitals for near real-time analytics for direct patient care, streamlining services and research ([](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299; https://cogstack.github.io/). A key component of this system is our clinical NLP tool MedCAT ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10166; https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT).

The role will build clinical NLP and phenotyping using electronic health records, putting these tools in the hands of clinical users. As such this tool is a foundational piece of work to enable a multitude of subsequent projects and grant applications which use this software to identify a cohort of patients from the EHR.

This is a 50% FTE post (17.5 hours per week), and you will be offered a fixed term contract for 8 months.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

We may be biased, but eHealth Saskatchewan is the place to be right now! As the result of a province wide consolidation of IT services in the health care sector, we have seen substantial growth in our organization that is only going to increase as we aim to meet our expanded mandate and the immense need for our support. This gives our people a unique and rare opportunity to truly create, build, improve, and leave their mark on a growing organization.

A large and complex organization, eHealth is comprised of 30+ clinical and non-clinical program (service) areas that all work together to support healthcare providers and teams across the province in delivering the best possible care to patients, providers, citizens, and health system users. Programs range from primary care to acute care, and include laboratories, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics. Additional programs that also support patient care and information, include Virtual Care, MySaskHealthRecord, and the provincial Electronic Health Record. eHealth is also responsible for administering various pieces of legislation to manage the registration of/changes to all vital event records (e.g., birth, marriage, death), legal name changes, and adoptions, as well as maintaining the provincial health registry for health services eligibility and distribution of health services cards.

eHealth teams engage directly with health system partners and other stakeholders both provincially and federally to ensure all services are delivered efficiently and effectively.

About The Role

Reporting to the Manager of Analytics, Data Quality and AI, we are seeking a skilled and experienced Data Scientist who has a passion for data and the desire to positively impact people’s lives in Saskatchewan. eHealth Saskatchewan provides services to other health system partners like Sask Cancer, Ministry of Health and SHA in order to fulfill their data and information needs. The successful candidate will be able to co-create solutions with our partners to achieve the desired results. You will provide mentorship and informal leadership for other team members including providing support, such as subject matter expertise or project coordinator for junior members on the team. To be successful in this role you will be curious, creative, adaptable, logical, a strong communicator, and a flexible team player.

The successful candidate will possess deep technical knowledge of data and analytics concepts, theories, and the ability to implement those concepts and theories. You will be able to use the available data to understand a situation and look for ways to improve the outcomes.

Typical Daily Duties:

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

What you’ll do

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Credit Detection brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s credit risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. Achieving this goal is critical to Stripe’s long term growth and profitability. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from credit losses that can put our financial position at risk.

The Credit Detection team consists of machine learning engineers who want to tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We work closely with our credit partners in product, business, data science, and operations to prioritize and drive our shared strategy. We are continuously exploring and undertaking new ideas and as an Engineering Manager you can have an outsized impact on the future of how Stripe manages risk at scale.

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers, product managers, and data scientists to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

What you’ll do

Credit Detection brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s credit risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. Achieving this goal is critical to Stripe’s long term growth and profitability. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from credit losses that can put our financial position at risk.

The Credit Detection team consists of machine learning engineers who want to tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We work closely with our credit partners in product, business, data science, and operations to prioritize and drive our shared strategy.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom

Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$142,400 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.

          <p>Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most exciting open problems in machine learning. Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.</p><p><br></p><p>Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!
