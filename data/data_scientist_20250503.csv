We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.

Lila Sciences is the world’s first scientific superintelligence platform and autonomous lab for life, chemistry, and materials science.  We are pioneering a new age of boundless discovery by building the capabilities to apply AI to every aspect of the scientific method.  We are introducing scientific superintelligence to solve humankind's greatest challenges, enabling scientists to bring forth solutions in human health, climate, and sustainability at a pace and scale never experienced before. Learn more about this mission at  www.lila.ai  

At Lila, we are uniquely cross-functional and collaborative. We are actively reimagining the way teams work together and communicate. Therefore, we seek individuals with an inclusive mindset and a diversity of thought. Our teams thrive in unstructured and creative environments. All voices are heard because we know that experience comes in many forms, skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

🌟 Your Impact at Lila

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

🛠️ What You'll Be Building


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


🧰 What You’ll Need To Succeed


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


🌈 We’re All In

Lila Sciences is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

🤝 A Note to Agencies

Lila Sciences does not accept unsolicited resumes from any source other than candidates. The submission of unsolicited resumes by recruitment or staffing agencies to Lila Sciences or its employees is strictly prohibited unless contacted directly by Lila Science’s internal Talent Acquisition team. Any resume submitted by an agency in the absence of a signed agreement will automatically become the property of Lila Sciences, and Lila Sciences will not owe any referral or other fees with respect thereto.

About The Role

We’re a telehealth company helping people lose weight at scale. Our internal team is core to delivering care—but scaling care delivery is messy, complex, and full of hidden inefficiencies. We’re looking for a Data Scientist who thrives on turning operational chaos into clarity. As a data scientist at Mochi Health, you’ll have the opportunity to work with and support various departments from marketing to operations. You’ll combine analytical thinking with engineering pragmatism—owning dashboards, automating workflows, uncovering bottlenecks, and building internal tools that let our team move faster with less friction. This role is ideal for someone who wants impact, autonomy, and real-world complexity.

What You’ll Do


Own the full lifecycle of operational metrics—from KPI design to dashboard deployment and stakeholder adoption.
Design metrics that drive accountability, surface inefficiencies, and guide automation.
Automate high-friction workflows using Python, APIs, and lightweight tools.
Integrate Generative AI and LLMs to optimize and augment workflows.
Apply causal inference, forecasting, or A/B testing where necessary.
Choose the right surface for delivery—Tableau, Streamlit, Google Sheets—based on context and audience.


Who You Are


Bachelor’s or Master’s in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering).
2+ years of experience using data to solve product, marketing, or business problems.
Strong Python and SQL skills; write clean, maintainable code.
Experienced in building dashboards (e.g. Tableau) and internal tools (e.g. Streamlit).
Curious, self-directed, and impact-driven—you chase high-leverage problems.
Clear communicator who can simplify the complex for any audience.
Comfortable with ambiguity and switching contexts in a fast-moving environment.

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market. In compliance with pay transparency laws and in pursuit of pay equity and fairness, we publish salary ranges for our open roles. On top of base salary, we also offer equity, generous perks and comprehensive benefits.

Data at Brex

What You’ll Do

As a Data Scientist, Credit, you will partner closely with our Credit, Enterprise Risk, and Data Science teams to develop analytical frameworks that inform underwriting policies and credit risk strategies. Your work will directly support our Chief Risk Officer in executing a targeted loss rate while ensuring sustainable growth for our credit offerings. You will leverage data science techniques to enhance our credit risk assessment, optimize lending decisions, and refine our risk-based pricing models. Your insights will play a critical role in aligning risk management with business strategy and regulatory considerations.

The ideal candidate has experience in credit risk modeling, underwriting analytics, and quantitative risk assessment. They should have strong business acumen, deep familiarity with credit products, and the ability to communicate technical insights to non-technical stakeholders.

Where you’ll work

This role will be based in our San Francisco office. You must be willing to work in office at least 2 days per week on Wednesday and Thursday. Employees will be able to work remotely for up to 4 weeks per year.

Responsibilities


Develop analytical frameworks and risk models to inform underwriting decisions and credit policy optimization.
Analyze loss rate trends, credit performance, and portfolio risk dynamics to drive strategy adjustments.
Collaborate with Credit and Enterprise Risk teams to establish data-driven risk appetite frameworks and lending criteria.
Work closely with our Credit Risk Machine Learning team to improve risk-scoring methodologies and loss forecasting models.
Support pricing and limit-setting strategies through quantitative analysis of risk-adjusted returns.
Design and evaluate tests to policy changes to measure the impact of credit risk strategies on financial performance.


Requirements


Master’s degree or Ph.D. in Statistics, Economics, Finance, Computer Science, or a related quantitative field.
3+ years of experience in credit risk analytics, underwriting strategy, or related data science roles in lending or financial services.
Strong experience with SQL and Python (or R) for data analysis and modeling.
Proficiency in credit risk modeling techniques, including logistic regression, scorecard development, and loss forecasting.
Familiarity with credit bureau data, alternative data sources, and regulatory risk considerations.
Ability to synthesize complex analyses into actionable business insights and communicate findings to stakeholders.
Experience with experimentation and causal inference methodologies.


Bonus Points


Experience working in B2B SaaS or fintech, particularly in a lending environment.
Familiarity with risk-based pricing models and financial modeling techniques.
Experience working with credit decisioning systems and automated underwriting workflows.
Knowledge of regulatory frameworks such as CECL, Basel II/III, or stress testing methodologies.


This role offers a unique opportunity to shape the future of credit risk strategy at Brex while working with a world-class data and risk management team. If you are passionate about using data science to drive better lending decisions, we’d love to hear from you!

Compensation

The expected salary range for this role is $152,000 - $190,000. However, the starting base pay will depend on a number of factors including the candidate’s location, skills, experience, market demands, and internal pay parity. Depending on the position offered, equity and other forms of compensation may be provided as part of a total compensation package.
