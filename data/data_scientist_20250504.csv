We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Machine Learning Research Scientist in Aignostics’ foundation model team, you will work on developing large-scale self-supervised models. Together with collaborators in academia and industry you will push the state of the art in foundation models for digital pathology. Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take responsibility and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Location: London

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Data Scientist with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.

The School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine & Sciences (Head, Professor Mauro Giacca) provides an outstanding multi-disciplinary environment for the pursuit of cutting-edge cardiovascular and metabolic research . Our current research spans the fundamental molecular, cellular, and physiological processes that underly normal and abnormal cardiovascular and metabolic function and drive the translation of this strong basic science into advances in clinical practice. The School occupies facilities across the Guy’s, St Thomas’ and Denmark Hill campuses of King’s College London and comprises over 70 clinical and non-clinical academic groups, hosting 400 personnel and 110 PhD students. Clinical and pre-clinical researchers at King’s have access to a state-of-the art core facilities and expertise, including multimodality in vivo imaging, clinical research facilities, experimental medicine hub, high-throughput robotic screening, comprehensive 3 genomics/proteomics/metabolomics/single cell analyses, integrative invasive and non-invasive human physiology, comprehensive murine physiology and genetic modification, etc. There is an innovative clinical informatics platform integrated with large language models for the analyses of electronic health records across the King’s Health Partner NHS Trusts. Assisted by the close collaboration between clinical and academic colleagues and the outstanding infrastructure, all the building blocks are in place for the generation of novel advances with major clinical impact. The School hosts a range of training programmes including three PhD programmes in cardiovascular sciences and advanced therapies, an MSc in Cardiovascular Sciences and an iBSc in Cardiovascular Medicine. Multiple other doctoral training programmes are available across the Faculty.

About The Role

The postholder will contribute to development of our portfolio of clinical and health informatics platforms and research which sits within the King’s BHF Centre of Research Excellence (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/scms/bhf-centre) and specifically work within the Coronary Research Group at KCL.

The Coronary Research Group carries out translational research into the mechanisms and consequences of cardiac ischaemia with a view to developing and evaluating novel and personalised treatments for ischaemic heart disease. The group employs diverse research methodologies to achieve these aims, from exploration of the pathophysiological basis of disease states by detailed characterisation of patients during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through designing and conducting multicentre randomised clinical trials to applying machine learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to data extracted from routine health records. The work will also include areas relevant to the BHF Centre Themes including heart failure, obesity and metabolic diseases with the scope of extending the timeframe of the contract based on the receipt of renewed funding. The Group’s research is funded by peer-reviewed grants from charities (including the Academy of Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation and Medical Research Council) and public funding (UK National Institute for Health Research and US National Institute for Health) as well as investigator-initiated commercial funding.

The primary purpose of this role is to develop a cohort identification tool for cardiovascular research using multimodal electronic health records data. This will require the development of both the tool itself and a number of clinical phenotyping algorithms. This new tool will be part of the CogStack ecosystem, currently being deployed to multiple hospitals for near real-time analytics for direct patient care, streamlining services and research ([](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299; https://cogstack.github.io/). A key component of this system is our clinical NLP tool MedCAT ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10166; https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT).

The role will build clinical NLP and phenotyping using electronic health records, putting these tools in the hands of clinical users. As such this tool is a foundational piece of work to enable a multitude of subsequent projects and grant applications which use this software to identify a cohort of patients from the EHR.

This is a 50% FTE post (17.5 hours per week), and you will be offered a fixed term contract for 8 months.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)


If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Hello! We're Teya.

Teya is a payment and software service provider, headquartered in London serving small, local businesses across Europe. Founded in 2019, we build easy to use, integrated tools that enable our members to accept payments and boost business performance.

At Teya we believe small, local businesses are the lifeblood of our communities.

We’re here because we don’t believe there’s a level playing field that gives small businesses with a fighting chance against the giants of the high street.

We’re here because we see banks and legacy service providers making things harder for them. We don’t think the best technology or the best service should be reserved for those with the biggest headquarters.

We’re here to fight for a future where small, local businesses can thrive, and to commit the same dedication they offer all of us.

Become a part of our story.

We’re looking for exceptional talent to join our mission. We offer a chance to create impact in a high-energy and connected culture, while benefiting from continuous learning opportunities, a supportive community which is proud to serve our mission, and comprehensive benefits.

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.




Who we're looking for

We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to play a key role in our Core Pricing team. You will drive innovation by optimising and automating Pricing processes to enable faster, more accurate decision-making. Your work will focus on developing and maintaining tooling and frameworks that enhance the efficiency of our predictive models, reducing deployment times, increasing scalability, and improving model performance through regular updates and monitoring. You will work closely with our Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product team to deliver scalable, production-grade ML systems.




Key Responsibilities

Build model lifecycle tooling (deployment, monitoring and alerting) for our predictive models (for example claims cost, conversion, retention, market models)
Maintain and improve the development environment (Kubeflow) used by our Data Scientists and Actuaries
Develop and maintain pricing analytics tools that enable faster impact assessments, reducing manual work
Collaborate with the technical pricing, street pricing and product teams to gather requirements and feedback on tooling and to build impactful technology
Communicate complex concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders through clear storytelling




Required Skills

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science or related field
Experience: Proven experience in ML model lifecycle management
Core Competencies:
Model lifecycle: You’ve got hands-on experience with managing the ML model lifecycle, including both online and batch processes
Statistical Methodology: You have worked with GLMs and other machine learning algorithms and have in-depth knowledge of how they work
Python: You have built and deployed production-grade Python applications and you are familiar with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
Tooling & Environment:
DevOps: You have experience working with DevOps tooling, such as gitops, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools (we use buildkite) and Docker
Cloud: You have worked with cloud-based environments before (we use AWS)
SQL: You have a good grasp of SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Version control: You are proficient with git
Soft Skills:
You are an excellent communicator, with an ability to translate non-technical requirements into clear, actionable pieces of work
You have proven your project management skills, with the ability to manage multiple priorities
You have worked closely together in cross-functional teams, including with Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product Managers




Nice To Have

Experience in UK motor insurance
Telematics Data: Familiarity with behavioural driving data and its application in insurance pricing
Understanding of pricing modelling tools such as Akur8 or Emblem
Experience with IaC (we use Terraform)
Experience with gRPC/protobuf

How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?

What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?


The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.




Vertex Search is acting as a recruitment agency on this assignment.

We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.




Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. For over five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck, Rakovina Therapeutics, and ImmVue Therapeutics.




You will help identify, clean, prepare, and test datasets; run experiments to evaluate new architectures and tune hyperparameters; continually improve the robustness and efficiency of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. In this process, you will have the opportunity to build your skills by collaborating with our team of accomplished ML scientists and chemists. Software engineering expertise is required, as well as experience with deep learning and generative models; knowledge of chemistry and pharmacology is preferred be not required.




Here is the background we’re looking for:

M.S. (Ph.D. preferred) in CS, applied mathematics, statistics, physics, or related discipline;
Experience with machine learning techniques, including diffusion models, Transformers, and Bayesian optimization, preferably demonstrated through peer-reviewed publications;
Two or more years’ experience developing robust code on larger projects, including code review, refactoring, unit testing, version control, etc.;
Mastery of Python and PyTorch;
Strong background in chemistry or pharmacology; and
Intellectual curiosity and drive to excel.




We are an equal opportunity employer and enthusiastically welcome applications from women, BIPOC, and members of underrepresented communities and groups. Compensation is a competitive mix of cash and options. We prioritize expertise and passion over where you decide to live and work. Please send resumes/CVs to info@variational.ai.

          <p>Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most exciting open problems in machine learning. Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.</p><p><br></p><p>Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. For over five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck, Rakovina Therapeutics, and ImmVue Therapeutics.</p><p><br></p><p>You will help identify, clean, prepare, and test datasets; run experiments to evaluate new architectures and tune hyperparameters; continually improve the robustness and efficiency of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. In this process, you will have the opportunity to build your skills by collaborating with our team of accomplished ML scientists and chemists. Software engineering expertise is required, as well as experience with deep learning and generative models; knowledge of chemistry and pharmacology is preferred be not required.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here is the background we’re looking for:</strong></p><ul><li>M.S. (Ph.D. preferred) in CS, applied mathematics, statistics, physics, or related discipline;</li><li>Experience with machine learning techniques, including diffusion models, Transformers, and Bayesian optimization, preferably demonstrated through peer-reviewed publications;</li><li>Two or more years’ experience developing robust code on larger projects, including code review, refactoring, unit testing, version control, etc.;</li><li>Mastery of Python and PyTorch;</li><li>Strong background in chemistry or pharmacology; and</li><li>Intellectual curiosity and drive to excel.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and enthusiastically welcome applications from women, BIPOC, and members of underrepresented communities and groups.

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

Job Description

What is the opportunity?

RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from LLM-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.

The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.

What will you do?

Ø Business Functions: Internal Audit, Cybersecurity, Fraud Management, Anti-Money Laundering, Insurance, Credit Risk, Technology Operations, Identity & Access Management, Human Resources.


Validation: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility & stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
Research & Development: You will read research papers (established work and state-of-the-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
IT: You will collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.


What do you need to succeed?

Strong communication and interpersonal skills
Progress towards a PhD or Master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Engineering, Quantitative Finance, or a related quantitative field

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

You work across the stack to connect ML systems with real user value.

You own end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and transformation to model training, validation, and online inference. You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

What You’ll Do


Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $120,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more.

We’re redefining how humans interact with massive amounts of imagery & video.




What that means

We’re building a near future where people can get information out of imagery at scale without building their own ML models. Collaborating with users around the world, our AI research and products change how people monitor and protect our oceans.




Our core technology: Find Anything & Video Search. We make it possible to find anything in imagery/video, without having seen it in training. Advancing the field of computer vision, pioneered in-house at OnDeck and published at one of the world’s most distinguished AI conferences (NeurIPS). 




Backed by National Geographic, the Environmental Defense Fund, Canada’s Ocean Supercluster, and many more, we stand at the forefront of AI for ocean conservation & protection. Our software has been deployed by governments, Indigenous nations, scientists, NGOs, and industry around the world. 




What you'll be doing

We’re excited to be pushing the boundaries of what is possible in computer vision: creating grounded visual reasoning & fine-grained classification, and searching for absolutely anything in thousands of hours of video footage. What you’ll start with is extending our NeurIPS workshop paper across several domains, scaling it to thousands of classes, and bridging the gap between video understanding models and our methods. We’ll provide the dedicated cloud GPUs and research autonomy for you to keep pushing the boundaries of visual reasoning.




You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our engineering team to bring this applied research into reality, watching as your research turns into real products in just a few weeks. And you’ll get to publish to conferences and journals too.




Impact and scope of work

You will have ownership over mission-critical research, propelling us towards the frontier of ocean tech and our goal of end-to-end visual automation. In this mix of machine learning research and research engineering, you will:

Develop state-of-the-art machine learning models that can reason about visual data and retrieve relevant answers from external knowledge sources. 
Research, implement, and optimize for various tasks, including object detection, species classification, and multi-object tracking for scalable ocean vision systems and environmental monitoring.
Devise better data-driven models for information retrieval, hierarchical classification, multi-modal fusion, generation and media understanding (CV & NLP).
Collaborate with engineers to translate research into products, as well as communicating research plans, progress, results, and impact to the whole organization and in conference/journal papers.
Collaborate and work across teams to develop concepts that advance the entire product pipeline, all the way to production (infrastructure, software, data collection, machine learning, etc.).
Conduct research that enables learning the semantics of data across multiple modalities (images, video, text, physical sensors, and other modalities).




You will also get visibility of the business and product side, and see how OnDeck is commercializing machine learning systems and infrastructure to deliver recurring value to customers and real change to ocean sustainability.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.
