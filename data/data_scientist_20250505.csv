About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

About The Team

Stripe Capital provides access to fast, flexible financing to small-and-medium businesses on Stripe to accelerate their growth, and we lent over $1B in 2024. Businesses use the funds for marketing, team growth, geographic expansion, working capital, new equipment purchases, and much more.

Machine learning is core to Stripe Capital’s business—we use information about businesses from their activity within and outside of Stripe and our models to automatically underwrite uniquely tailored financing offers to their needs, which banks are often unable to do. We are doing so through models with an established performance history, data infrastructure that is Stripe scale, and a strong feedback loop that includes explainability, anomaly detection and a risk portfolio management layer. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer for Stripe Capital, you will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production with the goals of providing financing opportunities to as many users as possible while satisfying financial performance goals. You will work closely with software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and risk managers to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Experience with Deep Learning including the latest architectures such as transformers, test-time compute, reinforcement learning



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $212,000 - $318,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

About The Team

Stripe Capital provides access to fast, flexible financing to small-and-medium businesses on Stripe to accelerate their growth, and we lent over $1B in 2024. Businesses use the funds for marketing, team growth, geographic expansion, working capital, new equipment purchases, and much more.

Machine learning is core to Stripe Capital’s business—we use information about businesses from their activity within and outside of Stripe and our models to automatically underwrite uniquely tailored financing offers to their needs, which banks are often unable to do. We are doing so through models with an established performance history, data infrastructure that is Stripe scale, and a strong feedback loop that includes explainability, anomaly detection and a risk portfolio management layer. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer for Stripe Capital, you will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production with the goals of providing financing opportunities to as many users as possible while satisfying financial performance goals. You will work closely with software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and risk managers to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Develop pipelines and automated processes to train and evaluate models in offline and online environments
Integrate ML models into production systems and ensure their scalability and reliability
Collaborate with product and strategy partners to propose, prioritize, and implement new product features
Engage with the latest developments in ML/AI and take calculated risks in transforming innovative ML ideas into productionized solutions



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about building ML systems that touch the lives of millions. You have experience developing efficient feature pipelines, building advanced ML models, and deploying them to production. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, have a bias towards action, and thrive in a collaborative environment.

We’re looking for someone who can bring new ideas to the table on building models able to push the state of the art at Stripe, especially within the regulatory and operational constraints of a financing business.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of industry experience building and shipping ML systems in production

Proven track record of building and deploying ML systems that have effectively solved ambiguous business problems
Experience in adversarial domains such as Lending, Trading, Fraud
Experience with Deep Learning including the latest architectures such as transformers, test-time compute, reinforcement learning



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $212,000 - $318,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

🌟 Your Impact at Lila

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

🛠️ What You'll Be Building


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


🧰 What You’ll Need To Succeed


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


🌈 We’re All In

Lila Sciences is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market. In compliance with pay transparency laws and in pursuit of pay equity and fairness, we publish salary ranges for our open roles. On top of base salary, we also offer equity, generous perks and comprehensive benefits.

Since its start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World's Most Experienced Driver™—to improve access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, a fully autonomous ride-hailing service, and can also be applied to a range of vehicle platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has provided over one million rider-only trips, enabled by its experience autonomously driving tens of millions of miles on public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 13+ U.S. states.

Rigorous performance evaluation of the Waymo Driver is a critical part of scaling our ride hailing service and achieving Waymo’s audacious goals. Waymo data scientists work hand-in-hand with engineering teams at each stage of the software development cycle, employing statistical models and developing metrics and measurement frameworks to ensure that the Waymo Driver meets our strict standards for safety, compliance, and driving and service quality. Autonomous driving presents a new paradigm in data science: in addition to leveraging data collected on-road, we generate our own data using state-of-the-art simulation technology—resulting in denser signals and challenging new problems in estimation and experimental design.

In this hybrid role you will report to a Data Science Manager.

You Will


Develop evaluation frameworks for autonomous vehicle performance, for large-scale ML models, and for the quality of simulation.
Develop new metrics, interpret trends, and investigate anomalies in data from simulation and on-road driving.
Develop novel statistical methods to handle unique aspects of AV data; e.g. rate estimation with rare events, combining real and synthetic data, etc.
Frame and solve ambiguous problems, derive data-driven conclusions, and communicate findings to senior stakeholders.
Collaborate with Product and Engineering partners developing the Waymo Driver and Waymo’s simulation software; facilitate deployment readiness decisions for both products.


You Have


Degree in a quantitative field (e.g. Statistics, Mathematics, Physics)
3+ years of industry experience solving data science problems or a PhD in a quantitative field
Expertise using advanced statistical methods in an applied setting; familiarity with ML systems/models
Demonstrated knowledge of Python/SQL/R data analysis libraries and packages


We Prefer


PhD in a quantitative field
Experience solving problems related to Autonomous Driving or Ride Hailing
Experience in adjacent relevant areas like Advanced Machine Learning (Deep Learning and Diffusion models), Traffic Modeling, Safety Evaluation or Prediction


The expected base salary range for this full-time position across US locations is listed below. Actual starting pay will be based on job-related factors, including exact work location, experience, relevant training and education, and skill level. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for the role location or, if the role can be performed remote, the specific salary range for your preferred location, during the hiring process.

Crowdwave is an exciting new product leveraging the power of LLMs to simulate audiences for consumer sentiment research. Before running costly human surveys to get feedback on new marketing materials, branding, product ideas, etc., companies and researchers use our product to quickly run surveys on virtual audiences representing specific consumer segments. AI allows for faster, lower-cost research, and unlocks additional types of studies such as iterative follow-up surveys, counterfactual comparisons, and lengthy or in-depth surveys that are impractical with human respondents.




Crowdwave’s team is drawn in part from Avenue Group, a leading research-driven advisory firm that specializes in delivering actionable insights to enhance decision-making processes for Fortune 500s, private equity firms, and mid-market companies. Leveraging advanced analytics and research methodologies, Avenue Group ensures that its clients achieve optimal strategic outcomes.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

As our Data Scientist for Go-to-Market, you will be a key business partner to our Sales and Revenue Operations team. Your work will be instrumental in shaping our data strategy as we design and implement a best-in-class Go-to-Market motion. From exploring what successful customer accounts look like to creating sales pipeline forecasts, your insights will directly impact business decisions and strategy. Each day will bring new challenges and opportunities to drive meaningful change with data.

What You'll Achieve


You will partner with Revenue Operations and Sales leads, driving forward all data science and analytics work in their functional areas
You will transform complex data into compelling insights, synthesizing them into crisp narratives for senior leadership that drive measurable business change (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
You will build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for critical decision-making, along with self-service tools that empower business partners
You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing sales outreach strategies or building a sales forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for GTM analytics



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Revenue Operations, Finance, Growth, Marketing
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy



Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Sales, Customer Success, Revenue Operations, and/or Finance teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)

Collaborative Research Support: Collaborate closely with our life sciences, computational biology and deep learning teams to support ongoing research. You will help biologists interpret data results and assist machine learning researchers in preparing data for modeling, ensuring that domain knowledge and data science intersect effectively.
Machine Learning Model Execution: Run and tune machine learning and deep learning models on real-world central nervous system (CNS) data. You’ll help set up experiments, execute training routines (for example, using scikit-learn or PyTorch models), and evaluate model performance to extract meaningful patterns that could inform drug discovery.
Statistical Insight Generation: Apply statistical analysis and visualization techniques to derive actionable insights from complex data. Whether it’s identifying gene expression patterns or correlating molecular changes with experimental conditions, you will contribute to turning data into scientific discoveries.
Reporting & Communication: Document your analysis workflows and results in clear reports or dashboards. Present findings to the team, highlighting key insights and recommendations. You will play a key role in translating data into stories that drive decision-making in our R&D efforts.


Qualifications And Skills


Strong Python Proficiency: Expert coding skills in Python and deep familiarity with the standard data science stack. You have hands-on experience with NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization; scikit-learn for machine learning; and preferably PyTorch (or similar frameworks like TensorFlow) for deep learning tasks.
Educational Background: A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Statistics, or a related field. Equivalent practical project experience or internships in data science will also be considered.
Machine Learning Knowledge: Solid understanding of machine learning fundamentals and algorithms. Experience developing or applying models to real or simulated datasets (through coursework or projects) is expected. Familiarity with high-dimensional data techniques or bioinformatics methods is a plus.
Analytical & Problem-Solving Skills: Comfortable with statistics and data analysis techniques for finding signals in noisy data. Able to break down complex problems, experiment with solutions, and clearly interpret the results.
Team Player: Excellent communication and collaboration skills. Willingness to learn from senior scientists and ability to contribute effectively in a multidisciplinary team that includes biologists, data engineers, and AI researchers.
Motivation and Curiosity: Highly motivated, with an evident passion for data-driven discovery. You are excited by Bexorg’s mission and eager to take on challenging tasks – whether it’s mastering a new analysis method or digging into scientific literature – to push our research forward.


Bexorg is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to create a supportive and inclusive workplace where contributions are valued and celebrated, and our employees thrive by being themselves and are inspired to do their best work. We seek applicants of all backgrounds and identities, across race, color, ethnicity, national origin or ancestry, citizenship, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or parental status, or disability. Applicants will not be discriminated against based on these or other protected categories or social identities. Bexorg will also consider for employment qualified applicants with criminal histories in a manner consistent with applicable federal, state and local law.

Join Our Generative AI Technical Group at Tweag the OSPO of Modus Create!

We are looking for an AI Engineer to join our Generative AI technical group, where we combine engineering agility with deep expertise and a scientific approach to advance the state of how AI is used, provide actionable practical insights, and establish best practices in the field.

About You

Previously, you worked as an AI engineer, data engineer or software developer, with a couple of AI or data-centric projects under the hood. Perhaps you have been relying on previous academic experience in a quantitative field for autonomous, deep-dive work for that, but no matter how, you absorb quickly and enthusiastically. Since The Hype started, you have successfully designed and implemented applications using Generative AI.

Now that you know how to build stuff, you realized that there are wrong turns commonly taken in the community, whether imposed by tooling or by culture. As an engineer, you want to make the AI world a better place for not only developers, but also maintainers, product owners, and end users.

If you recognize yourself in parts of the above, the Generative AI group at Tweag, the OSPO of Modus Create, wants you to help us advance the way how AI technologies are used in the field. By building well-written open source tools and libraries, freely and happily sharing knowledge internally, on our technical blog, and during conferences, and consulting clients on how to build better with AI, you and the whole team can make a real difference: let's look behind all the buzz and make sure things are done right™!
