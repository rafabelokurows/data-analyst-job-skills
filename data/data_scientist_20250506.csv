Good written and verbal communication in both English and German. Most of our clients are German speaking so a level of at least B2 is required for the role.


Resident in Germany. Due to the size of the company, we cannot currently accept applications from other EU/non-EU countries.





We explicitly do not hire anyone who discriminates against people on the basis of religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status or other aspects. We encourage people from LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented groups to apply.




Last but not least, keep in mind that we are hiring value based, not skill based. That being said, please tell us the following in your contact message:

Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take responsibility and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills.

You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.

Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Out humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Requirements

Read more about what we’re building here.

You Can Expect


insane amounts of ownership
hard technical challenges
that what you build is commercially and environmentally valuable


In Return, We Ask For


the courage to build new things fast
a commitment to real world impact over technical perfection
a desire to help build and lead an exceptional and tight knit team
deep-seated motivation to combat climate change


And It’d Be Nice If You Could Bring


knowledge of the electricity system, specifically power trading
comfort speaking to clients (we’re a small team and we all wear many hats)
familiarity with time-series data


You Shouldn't Apply If


uncertainty scares you
you aren't prepared to try, fail, and try again
you're looking for a low intensity, low impact role


Interview process


Initial interview
Take-home exercise
Final interview (in-person)
Offer, references, and welcome to the team!


Tech stack

We do everything in Python, because it allows data scientists and engineers to collaborate closely and move quickly. Our data scientists write lots of production code. We ❤️ Streamlit.

We try a bunch of things in Figma before we build them in code, because it's a fast and cheap way to get feedback.

Everything we build lives in Docker, for minimal cross-platform faff and maximal reproducibility.

☁️ We deploy on GCP

Benefits

We love the idea of fully remote work but it doesn't… work. For very early stage companies, people learn faster, get on better, and accomplish more when they're spending a decent chunk of time together. We ask that you spend 2-3 days a week in our London office.

We are extremely keen to build a diverse company, and we’re particularly eager to hear from candidates who don't fit the traditional engineering stereotypes. If you’re motivated by our mission, please do reach out, even if you feel you might not ‘check all the boxes’.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.




Who we're looking for

We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to play a key role in our Core Pricing team. You will drive innovation by optimising and automating Pricing processes to enable faster, more accurate decision-making. Your work will focus on developing and maintaining tooling and frameworks that enhance the efficiency of our predictive models, reducing deployment times, increasing scalability, and improving model performance through regular updates and monitoring. You will work closely with our Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product team to deliver scalable, production-grade ML systems.




Key Responsibilities

Build model lifecycle tooling (deployment, monitoring and alerting) for our predictive models (for example claims cost, conversion, retention, market models)
Maintain and improve the development environment (Kubeflow) used by our Data Scientists and Actuaries
Develop and maintain pricing analytics tools that enable faster impact assessments, reducing manual work
Collaborate with the technical pricing, street pricing and product teams to gather requirements and feedback on tooling and to build impactful technology
Communicate complex concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders through clear storytelling




Required Skills

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science or related field
Experience: Proven experience in ML model lifecycle management
Core Competencies:
Model lifecycle: You’ve got hands-on experience with managing the ML model lifecycle, including both online and batch processes
Statistical Methodology: You have worked with GLMs and other machine learning algorithms and have in-depth knowledge of how they work
Python: You have built and deployed production-grade Python applications and you are familiar with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
Tooling & Environment:
DevOps: You have experience working with DevOps tooling, such as gitops, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools (we use buildkite) and Docker
Cloud: You have worked with cloud-based environments before (we use AWS)
SQL: You have a good grasp of SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Version control: You are proficient with git
Soft Skills:
You are an excellent communicator, with an ability to translate non-technical requirements into clear, actionable pieces of work
You have proven your project management skills, with the ability to manage multiple priorities
You have worked closely together in cross-functional teams, including with Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product Managers




Nice To Have

Experience in UK motor insurance
Telematics Data: Familiarity with behavioural driving data and its application in insurance pricing
Understanding of pricing modelling tools such as Akur8 or Emblem
Experience with IaC (we use Terraform)
Experience with gRPC/protobuf

Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)


If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic.

Fine-tune and deploy large language models for patent search, analysis, drafting, and other intellectual property workflows.
Evaluate and improve large language model outputs for quality, relevance, and accuracy.
Develop and optimise search retrievals and ranking models for large-scale patent and technical literature datasets.
Productionise ML models within AWS, including deployment, monitoring, and integration with backend services.




What we are looking for




Has a track record of building world class software. Ideally you have 3+ years of experience building ML applications.
Thrives in a fast-paced & ambiguous environment. You work quickly and iteratively. We work in one-week sprints to ensure we are delivering value and and leading the market.
Seeks ownership. You own your work, approach problems critically, and take pride in what you build. We believe this is the best way to for you to grow and for the product to succeed. We create the environment to help you thrive as an owner.
Wants to work in-person. At this stage of our company, we believe being in the same space enables better communication, quicker decision-making, and fosters a collaborative culture that empowers us to outpace the competition.
[Bonus points] Has experience deploying production ML applications, working with reranking & fine tuning strategies, and/or building large scale content indexing systems.




We believe in people who are driven by curiosity, willing to learn and able to go the extra mile. Please also reach out if you don't exactly ""check all these boxes"".




What else you might want to know




Location: London (no remote)
Contract: Full-time
Compensation: We pay competitive salaries and will reward you with a substantial equity package under the tax-efficient EMI scheme.

We’re building the software infrastructure for the decarbonised energy system, backed by some of the best investors in the world (TechCrunch).

We make the technology to move energy usage to times when electricity is cheap and green. Our software controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries. We use machine learning to figure out what energy people will need, and when they'll need it. We control tens of thousands of energy assets, and we’re growing quickly.

Requirements

Read more about what we’re building here.

You Can Expect


insane amounts of ownership
hard technical challenges
that what you build is commercially and environmentally valuable


In Return, We Ask For


the courage to build new things fast
a commitment to real world impact over technical perfection
a desire to help build and lead an exceptional and tight knit team
deep-seated motivation to combat climate change


And It’d Be Nice If You Could Bring


knowledge of the electricity system, specifically power trading
comfort speaking to clients (we’re a small team and we all wear many hats)
familiarity with time-series data


You Shouldn't Apply If


uncertainty scares you
you aren't prepared to try, fail, and try again
you're looking for a low intensity, low impact role


Interview process


Initial interview
Take-home exercise
Final interview (in-person)
Offer, references, and welcome to the team!


Tech stack

We do everything in Python, because it allows data scientists and engineers to collaborate closely and move quickly. Our data scientists write lots of production code. We ❤️ Streamlit.

We try a bunch of things in Figma before we build them in code, because it's a fast and cheap way to get feedback.

Everything we build lives in Docker, for minimal cross-platform faff and maximal reproducibility.

☁️ We deploy on GCP

Benefits

We love the idea of fully remote work but it doesn't… work. For very early stage companies, people learn faster, get on better, and accomplish more when they're spending a decent chunk of time together. We ask that you spend 2-3 days a week in our London office.

We are extremely keen to build a diverse company, and we’re particularly eager to hear from candidates who don't fit the traditional engineering stereotypes. If you’re motivated by our mission, please do reach out, even if you feel you might not ‘check all the boxes’.

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Data Scientist with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Experienced Deep Learning Engineer For Game Technology

We are looking for an experienced machine learning engineer with a solid understanding of low-level systems programming. If you are as comfortable in the memory view of your debugger as you are with training networks to solve problems, we would love you hear from you.

Examples of some projects include the runtime tracking of PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers and a novel facial performance capture system used to produce assets for AAA games.

Role Overview

You are expected to develop innovative algorithms to solve novel problems, make technology choices, prototype solutions and bring them to production. Some of these systems are expected to run on millions of PlayStations in people’s homes, making high run-time performance crucial. You should stay up to date with the competition and the industry’s latest advances and academic developments. The role also involves close collaboration with our other teams in Europe, the U.S and Japan, as well as technical communication of the ideas and solutions developed.

What We're Looking For


Extensive experience with modern Deep Learning (PyTorch/TensorFlow): You will be expected to make decisions about data and architectures, to implement pipelines for training and validation and to develop and deploy models in production.
Experience with C++ programming and strong debugging skills
Understanding and experience of 3D maths/geometry: Including multiple-view geometry and 3D mesh representations.


Nice-to-have


Experience with Graphics and/or Game Engines
Experience with Computer Vision

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$142,400 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$193,500 - C$290,300. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

You will work on LLM-based models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and AI-driven automation, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to extract, analyze, and structure complex permitting data.


Design, implement, and optimize LLM-powered models for document processing, data extraction, and permit application workflows.
Develop and fine-tune retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines to improve query processing and information retrieval.
Experiment with pre-trained models and fine-tune them for permit-related NLP tasks, such as document classification and entity recognition.
Build scalable machine learning infrastructure, integrating with backend systems to support AI-driven workflows.
Work with large-scale structured and unstructured data to ensure efficient indexing, retrieval, and contextual relevance.
Monitor and improve the performance and scalability of deployed models.
Stay updated with the latest research in LLMs, NLP, retrieval systems, and apply best practices to our AI models.
Collaborate with engineers, product managers, and legal experts to develop AI-native solutions for complex permitting challenges.


🙌 Qualifications & Fit:


3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, ideally in production environments.
Strong understanding of LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face models) and their applications.
Hands-on experience with retrieval systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, FAISS, or vector databases).
Proficiency in Python and common ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
Experience with ML model deployment, monitoring, and scaling in a cloud environment (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

Data science experimentation and testing: Exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, model validation and monitoring.
Setting standards: Collaborate with other Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, Operations Managers, and other stakeholders to explore and implement processes and tools to improve data science quality and efficiency.
Ideation and brainstorming discussion: Show curiosity, ask discovery questions, avoid premature conclusions, flag risks and concerns at early stages, and facilitate trade-off or prioritization discussions.
Communication and reporting: Translating and communicating complex data science concepts and the value of analytical projects to non-technical stakeholders. Creating lightweight prototype demos, preparing and presenting reports, findings, and recommendations to senior management and other key stakeholders to support go/no-go recommendations.
Documenting best practices: Establishing new modeling approaches, pipelines and infrastructure as part of the Data & Analytics team at Altus by sharing and documenting best practices based on solid statistical/econometric/ML principles.

Passionate about succeeding together and scaling your impact through collaboration.
A scientist at heart—methodical, curious, and driven by thoughtful experimentation.
Strong background in statistics/econometrics with familiarity in hypothesis testing, regression models, time series analysis, tree-based models, clustering, anomaly detection, etc. (Bonus: experience in NLP, transfer learning, or Generative AI.)
Programming proficiency in SQL and Python with experience across the model lifecycle: data ETL, feature engineering, model tuning, evaluation, and deployment.
Comfortable brainstorming, receiving feedback, and iterating on solutions with a growth mindset.
2+ years of experience in data science or applied economics, depending on academic background.
BS or MS degree in Economics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, or a related technical field.
Experience with GitHub, version control, and collaborative coding workflows.
Skilled at writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code with attention to performance and cost.

Job Description

What is the opportunity?

RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from LLM-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.

The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.

What will you do?


Application: You will have the opportunity to work in any of the many areas we work in, across an even wider variety of business functions, such as the following:

Ø Business Functions: Internal Audit, Cybersecurity, Fraud Management, Anti-Money Laundering, Insurance, Credit Risk, Technology Operations, Identity & Access Management, Human Resources.


Validation: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility & stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
Research & Development: You will read research papers (established work and state-of-the-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
IT: You will collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.

About the Opportunity

Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most high-impact and intellectually demanding challenges in modern machine learning. Traditional pharmaceutical development is costly, slow, and heavily reliant on trial-and-error, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single new drug to market. This presents a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform the space by enhancing prediction accuracy, enabling generative molecular design, and drastically shortening development cycles.




This role offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of deep learning, generative modeling, and computational chemistry, with the goal of radically accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics. You will be part of a team that has spent years pushing the boundaries of ML for drug development, collaborating with top-tier pharma clients, and publishing impactful research.




Your Impact

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you will:

Design and implement novel machine learning architectures (e.g., diffusion models, graph neural networks, Transformers) tailored to the optimization of small molecule properties.
Drive research-first development: test new algorithmic approaches, quantify uncertainty, and contribute to the creation of a robust and generalizable ML platform for molecular design.
Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts across chemistry, pharmacology, and software engineering to bring research concepts into practical applications.
Contribute to the scientific roadmap of an ML-native drug discovery platform, influencing both technical direction and applied use cases.
Publish in top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), where appropriate, and participate in broader scientific dialogue.




What We’re Looking For

Ph.D. in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or a closely related quantitative discipline.
Strong publication record, preferably as a first author, in top ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
Deep understanding of modern machine learning, including:
Generative models (e.g., diffusion, VAEs, GANs)
Transformers and attention mechanisms
Graph neural networks
Uncertainty modeling and Bayesian optimization
Fluency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
2+ years of experience writing production-quality research code (version control, code review, unit testing, etc.).
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously on open-ended research problems.




No prior experience in chemistry or biology is required — domain knowledge will be provided through close collaboration with internal experts.




Why This Role?

Work on one of the most ambitious and meaningful applications of AI: using machine learning to solve real-world problems in drug development.
Join a lean, elite team of researchers and scientists who value curiosity, autonomy, and technical depth.
Rapid iteration cycle: datasets are small enough to train meaningful models in days, not months — enabling true research velocity.
Contribute to real-world drug discovery projects that have the potential to impact human health at scale.




If you're passionate about applying your ML expertise to meaningful, cross-disciplinary challenges — and want to work at the frontier of science and technology — this is a rare and rewarding opportunity.

Job Overview

As a Machine Learning Engineer II, you independently design, build, and maintain machine learning systems that deliver impact for our customers and business. You are responsible for deploying reliable, scalable solutions — from credit scoring models to intelligent automation and LLM-powered features. You work across the stack to connect ML systems with real user value.

You own end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and transformation to model training, validation, and online inference. You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

What You’ll Do


Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $120,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more. Due to high application volume, we may not be able to respond to everyone.

Thank you for your interest! We appreciate your time and look forward to reviewing your application!

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.
