If you are excited by technology that has the power to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second; collect tens of billions of events each day; and evaluate thousands of data-points in real-time all while responding in just a few milliseconds, then IAS is the place for you!

As a ML Scientist Intern you will work on advancing the understanding and application of dimensionality reduction techniques for sparse feature matrices generated by semantic engines. You will prototype, implement and evaluate a range of dimensionality reduction approaches. The second phase of the project will involve comparing the reduced-dimensional embedding spaces with existing pre-trained embeddings, to study similarities, overlaps, and differences in representation. This analysis will provide insights into how rule-based semantic features compare with context-aware neural representations This internship is an opportunity for you to gain practical experience with deep learning, interacting with large scale production environments and having the opportunity to research novel methods that can push the state of the art of media understanding and content evaluation.

What you’ll get to do:


Conduct in-depth research and experimentation on a wide array of dimensionality reduction techniques, with a particular focus on their applicability to sparse feature matrices commonly produced by semantic engines. This will involve prototyping, implementing, and rigorously evaluating methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and neural embedding models (e.g., autoencoders).
Leverage these feature representations to construct and train machine learning models that can effectively address a variety of downstream tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, or anomaly detection.
Work with the framework of your choice, e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.
Integrate machine learning models into production systems.
Stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field of machine learning and contribute to knowledge sharing within the team.



You should apply if you have most of this experience:


Currently pursuing a Master’s or PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Engineering, Statistics, or a related field.
Familiarity with machine learning and deep learning methods.
Proficiency in Python and experience with libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere. 

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 5 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus. 

Il/La Data Scientist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze di AI e Machine Learning, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in algoritmi e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi. 

I/Le nostri/e Data Scientist verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove comprenderanno le esigenze del Cliente, daranno indicazione ai Data Engineer sulla preparazione desiderata dei dati, sceglieranno o costruiranno i migliori mix di modelli più adatti al caso specifico, discuteranno gli output con il cliente e consegneranno il modello per l’ottimizzazione e passaggio in produzione finale ai Data Engineer. 

In contesti più semplificati in cui la componente di Data Engineering è meno elaborata, i nostri Data Scientist procederanno in autonomia anche nella data preparation e nel porting in produzione dei modelli ingegnerizzati. 

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Data Scientist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

Sibill is the accounting and financial operating system for small and medium businesses (SMBs).

Italy is the single largest EU country by number of SMBs. Italian SMBs employ 75% of workforce and generate two thirds of the country GDP. We want to unlock Italian SMBs productivity. Old tooling, manual processes, sparse data cause an average 8 hours/week wasted by our entrepreneurs. It simply can’t keep being as it is. Sibill gives this time back to entrepreneurs by bringing invoicing, payments, treasury and accounting in a single, modern platform.

International venture capital investors like Keen Venture Partners (Fiscozen), Founders A/S (Pleo), Exor Ventures (Qonto, Alan), Notion Capital - and many others - believe in our mission and pledged their capital to make it happen.

We are a product-driven company with a pragmatic approach to solve real problems. We count several thousands of entrepreneurs as customers. We want to get to millions - this is just the beginning.




What we look for

We are looking for a motivated, pragmatic, and goal-oriented Senior Data Scientist to join our Data team.




You are the perfect fit if...

You are passionate about technology, statistics and business. The three of them.
You don’t feel “done” yet, you want to keep learning and applying science to drive business outcome. You still want to be hands-on.
You are excited about working in a flat, no-politics, fast-paced environment.
You have excellent analytical skills and and a sharp eye for detail.
You are not scared of working hard. As a team, we all have to go the extra-mile to make it happen.
You feel like fitting the values we share at Sibill: ambition, pragmatism, efficiency, integrity




What you will do

You will report directly to the chief data officer/ co-founder. You will work with him and build all the data products that empower our customers to run their business better. This will not be a one-man standing. It will take a lot of cross-functional work with the people in our data, engineering, product, design teams.

We sit on top of the most business-critical company data. Money flows, bank transactions, invoices, cash register records, payables and receivables, general ledger records. We are the accounting & finance operating system of our customers. You will build data products that use this vast information set to solve specific customer problems.

Your responsibilities will include:

Discovery, domain understanding, data collection and experimentation
Model development (training / test / validation)
Performance monitoring and iteration over existing data products

Examples of projects you could work on from month one at Sibill:

Refining our autoreconciliation search algorithm (matching invoices with related financial money flows) to try and improve f-score.
Building a classification model to label general ledger records with the right chart of accounts codes.




What you will need

M.Sc./Ph.D. in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics or a related STEM field. You won’t be asked to send rockets to Mars - but a solid background in probability, stats, linear algebra and computational mathematics will give you an edge.
Modern Python and modern software development tools (Docker, CI/CD, unit testing, evals). We do not run data pipelines built on Jupyter Notebooks in production. Bonus point if you know you way around vector stores.
Proven expertise in leading model development using a wide range of techniques. Previous expertise in domains with high usage of neural networks (NLP, computer vision) is highly beneficial.
Especially at the beginning, an end-to-end data ownership mindset. It will not happen every day but - if necessary - you might be asked to build your own data pipeline end-to-end, to write a batch ETL, to write Elixir or TypeScript code, or to support teammates with an important one-off empirical analysis.
Fluency in English and Italian.
Bonus point: at least 7-8 years of experience. You have already coached and mentored junior colleagues.




Comp & Benefits

RAL: 70-90k
Employee stock options
Health insurance (AON)
Lunch voucher (8€/business day)
Full remote (based in Italy). We will just ask you to come to Milan for a few weeks during the onboarding (trip is on us)
You will work within a team of smart, hard-worker, passionate and nice human beings. People in Sibill tend to be very happy. Happiness is an underrated benefit ;-)




Recruiting process

30 minutes “know-each-other” session with Dario (Chief Data Officer)
45 minutes technical interview
you will meet some of the key people you will work with (engineering, data, product)
45 minutes with Mattia (CEO) and Lorenzo (Chief Product Officer)

If you are excited by technology that has the power to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second; collect tens of billions of events each day; and evaluate thousands of data-points in real-time all while responding in just a few milliseconds, then IAS is the place for you!

As a ML Scientist Intern you will work on advancing the understanding and application of dimensionality reduction techniques for sparse feature matrices generated by semantic engines. You will prototype, implement and evaluate a range of dimensionality reduction approaches. The second phase of the project will involve comparing the reduced-dimensional embedding spaces with existing pre-trained embeddings, to study similarities, overlaps, and differences in representation. This analysis will provide insights into how rule-based semantic features compare with context-aware neural representations This internship is an opportunity for you to gain practical experience with deep learning, interacting with large scale production environments and having the opportunity to research novel methods that can push the state of the art of media understanding and content evaluation.

What you’ll get to do:


Conduct in-depth research and experimentation on a wide array of dimensionality reduction techniques, with a particular focus on their applicability to sparse feature matrices commonly produced by semantic engines. This will involve prototyping, implementing, and rigorously evaluating methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and neural embedding models (e.g., autoencoders).
Leverage these feature representations to construct and train machine learning models that can effectively address a variety of downstream tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, or anomaly detection.
Work with the framework of your choice, e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.
Integrate machine learning models into production systems.
Stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field of machine learning and contribute to knowledge sharing within the team.



You should apply if you have most of this experience:


Currently pursuing a Master’s or PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Engineering, Statistics, or a related field.
Familiarity with machine learning and deep learning methods.
Proficiency in Python and experience with libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
Familiarity with SVD, BERT, ViT, or CLIP is a plus.
Experience with Self-Supervised Learning methods is also a plus.

You’ll work with McKinsey’s agricultural analytics team (ACRE) in Brussels.

Our Agriculture Practice advises agribusiness, consumer food, government, and investor clients on strategic, marketing & sales, and operations issues, helping support industry-shaping decisions that impact the future of global food production.

Within this group, ACRE is a team of expert consultants, data scientists, and engineers focused on bringing cutting-edge analytics to our agribusiness clients. We apply real-time data and advanced analytics – generally predictive or geospatial in nature – to solve the biggest problems currently facing global agricultural markets, driving insights at the micro and macro levels.

ACRE is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients.

Your Impact

You will leverage industry knowledge and analytical expertise to provide insights both to clients as part of client service teams and within the agricultural analytics team (ACRE) by strengthening the core products and algorithms we build for clients. You can expect to split your time delivering impact at clients (including up to ~50% travel to client sites) and building up ACRE’s core analytical offerings.

As a member of client service teams, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to tackle clients’ most pressing issues using an analytical lens, meeting client needs and communicating your work to executive audiences. Issues to solve could include determining the suitability (now and in the future given impacts of climate change) of growing different types of crops across different geographies, using local agronomic data and satellite imagery to determine market potential for input products, or optimizing farm operations using yield forecasting. Your work will often include heavy geospatial components and/or predictive analytics components.

When working internally with the ACRE team, you will build innovative algorithms and products (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will use global data such as geospatial, biological, economic and climatological data to develop proprietary solutions. You will work with our engineers to design new interfaces to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.

Along the way, you will receive best-in-class training in structuring business problems and serving as a client adviser and have opportunities to work closely with and learn from our senior agriculture practitioners and industry players that are shaping the future of food production. You will get access to unparalleled career acceleration, with a huge amount of ownership and responsibility from the get-go in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will get the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world. Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest agribusiness players around the globe.

We encourage you to submit a cover letter to highlight why you believe that you are a unique fit for our team and what we do! We will read it.

Your Qualifications and Skills

Python & Java
Kubernetes & Kubeflow
AWS / GCP
Jupyter notebooks
Git
Tensorflow
Machine Vision toolkits (YOLO, OpenCV, …)
Wandb
MLFlow




Ben jij de geknipte persoon voor deze rol?




Hard skills

Je hebt minstens 3 jaar relevante ervaring met Machine Learning.
Je hebt ervaring als tech lead in een nieuwe start-up omgeving.
Je hebt een goede kennis van het Engels en/of Nederlands.
Je hebt een goede kennis van software development.
Je flexibel kunnen opstellen in een dynamische werkomgeving. Prioriteiten stellen vormen voor jou dan ook geen probleem.
Ervaring in een test-driven development en Agile omgeving.




Soft skills

Je bezit goede communicatieve vaardigheden.
Je bent een teamplayer, maar je gaat ook graag zelfstandig te werk.
Je bent proactief ingesteld en gemotiveerd om nieuwe uitdagingen aan te gaan!




Hoe voelt dat, werken bij ACA?




Innovatieve werkomgeving: je werkt met de nieuwste technologie en tools in een omgeving die innovatie uitademt.
Een aantrekkelijk loon, een bedrijfswagen, maaltijdcheques, onkostenvergoeding, MacBook Pro en nog veel meer.
Leren & groeien: bij ACA heeft iedereen een on-the-job coach. Je beschikt over een persoonlijk evolutieplan met een budget voor technische en professionele trainingen en heel wat kansen om bij te leren.
We’ve got your back: we voorzien een uitgebreid gezondheids- en verzekeringsplan om tegemoet te komen aan jouw noden. Het is onze prioriteit om ervoor te zorgen dat onze collega’s gelukkig zijn, o.a. door een goede work-life balans, de juiste tools te voorzien, enzovoort.
Onze unieke bedrijfscultuur: je bent deel van een passioneel en hardwerkend team dat trots is op hun verwezenlijkingen. ACA is een plek waar teamwork, transparantie, kennisdeling en erkenning centraal staan. Trots om ons ""Great Place To Work"" te noemen!
Jij staat centraal: wij zijn gedreven door onze teamleden waarbij iedereen hun steentje bijdraagt, maar waar plaats is voor heel wat fun. Een fantastisch team werkt niet alleen samen, maar maakt ook samen plezier. Daarom organiseren we heel wat activiteiten binnen en buiten onze kantoren en vertrekken we elk jaar op een spetterend ACA-weekend!

The ideal candidate would be responsible for the full development process, including efficient programming, discussing functionalities with business experts, maintaining code & user documentation, all while ensuring a timely completion of the deliverables.

First-generation Python scripts have been created to compute the modifications that need to be made to the grid model, so that these “additional capacities” are accounted for. A set of hypotheses is used to determine how these capacities must be accounted for. The script can currently only be used in combination with the grid computation tool DigSilent PowerFactory.

To support the industrialization of the existing scripts, as well as the inclusion of new functionalities & a full migration to Python, we are looking for a senior data scientist with experience in advanced analytics

The main tasks expected are:

Development of an industrialized full-Python tool from requirements & first-generation script.
A refactoring of the scripts to distinguish the parts that must run within DigSilent PowerFactory or not.

Modular programming to anticipate future functionalities.
The inclusion of completeness verifications for input data.
The development of additional functionalities in close collaboration with the business experts, to limit manual pre-processing of the input data.
The creation of clear & maintainable documentation for the developed tool.

The following competencies are required for this position:

Python programming language experience
Efficient programming, to cope with vast amounts of data
Modular programming, adaptable to changing needs
Profiling and optimization of scripts
Code documentation

Requirements:

At least 5 years’ experience in Python programming
Fluency in English (spoken & written) as well as Dutch and/or French
Basic knowledge of electricity or electric power systems (grid structure, localization of electrical generation and consumption, etc.) is a plus.
Ability to handle vast amounts of data in an efficient manner
Well-organized and attention to details,
Fluent communication and coordination,
Autonomous and capable to manage & respect deadlines,
Strong analytical & problem-solving skills: ability to analyze, interpret and utilize data effectively for their desired purposes.

Additional information:

Location: 1000 Bxl
Work regime: Depending on the stage of the process can vary between 2 or 5 days a week
Start date: 16/06/2025
End date: 31/12/2025

Smartcat is on a mission to become the wall-to-wall Language AI platform, addressing the diverse needs in multilingual content for various user personas within global enterprises.

Smartcat is uniquely positioned within the $100+ billion multilingual content industry, which is currently served by tens of thousands of agencies. This results in a highly fragmented and inefficient supply chain, high costs, unacceptable turnaround times, and quality issues. Using highly qualified internal resources to translate or create multilingual content (insourcing) solves the quality problem for enterprises, but if done manually, it can't solve for scalability, high cost, and slow turnaround.

Smartcat changes the ROI equation in favor of insourcing with its Language AI platform for enterprise end-users. It delivers high-quality, instantaneous AI translations or generates new content in any language by tapping into a customer-specific multilingual content library. The AI output is further refined through human editing by the client's internal reviewers or experts from the Smartcat's embedded global marketplace of linguists and content editors. This AI output continuously improves through the editing feedback loop, ensuring consistent and customer-tailored results.

More than 1,000 global companies including ~20% of the Fortune 1,000 trust Smartcat to communicate their innovations and ideas all over the world.

As a dynamic Series C company, Smartcat is growing at 130% YoY, thanks to the high and quick ROI it delivers to global enterprises. It's well-funded by notable VCs, and is capital efficient, offering a unique blend of hyper-growth potential with downside protection and the capacity for long-term planning and strategy.

Please attach all the documents asked.




CONTEXT

The Royal Military Academy is fully recognized as a university, fulfilling the same criteria as civilian universities. The RMA is also conducting scientific research at university level for projects funded by the Belgian Defense department or external sources.

In the framework of the study SHABAM, we are looking for a full-time researcher in digital communications with a Bachelors/Master degree in Telecommunication Engineer (MSc), or equivalent, with firm background on Signal and Systems theory, digital communications and electronics.

We value diversity and equal opportunities. Whether you are a man, a woman or X, or come from any background, we firmly believe that diversity enriches our community, and we encourage all qualified candidates to apply.




PROJECT:

You work within the department of CISS of the Faculty of Polytechnic of the RMA and in close collaboration with researcher, scientists and engineers from the other consortium partners. You conduct scientific research at university level on a project entitled ‘SHABAM’.

The EDA ad hoc project type B called SHABAM for “SHAring BAndwidth in Military systems” will investigate the capability of DSM concepts to allow efficient spectrum usage between radio systems in an operation theatre that may consist of several nations operating on several co-operative or non-co-operative waveforms. Another challenge will be to provide robust improvements to the super high fidelity simulator to accommodate the new objectives, such as adding new UHF and VHF basic waveforms. The consortium is composed of 10 prime contractors, representing 5 different countries (BE, FI, FR, GE, NO). The Consortium Coordinator is Thales SIX from France.




MAIN TASKS:

Adding a second VHF waveform using bandwidth scaling. The N1 mode of the NBWF offers only a limited transmission capacity. A higher bit rate, by compromising some range, will render NBWF more interesting for bridging IP communication or control traffic, supporting UHF waveform, etc
Control of WF frequency hopping sequences : the idea is to control the VHF/UHF frequency hopping sequences of the communication networks for the coexistence of heterogeneous waveforms using Local DSM with cross-waveform signaling
VHF rate adaption : Having the possibility to use multiple bit rates within the same VHF network will add flexibility in dynamic environments where link characteristics change over time. To be able to handle multiple bit rates in the same VHF network, a link adaptation mechanism is needed at the link layer.




SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:

Degree(s) required: Master degree in Telecommunication Engineer (MSc), or equivalent, with firm background on Signal and Systems theory, digital communications and electronics.

This position is open for experienced profiles (ideally 3 years of experience minimum).




“MUST HAVE” skills :

Good experience in SDR/digital communications : modulation schemes, error correction coding, characterization of communication links (channel distortion, BER, FER)
Good experience in digital signal processing : digital filtering, digital modulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, interference mitigation etc.
Software Programming : MATLAB, C/C++ , Python.




“NICE TO HAVE” skills :

Knowledge of Dynamic Spectrum Management
Knowledge of Routing Algorithms (e.g. OLSR)
Knowledge of Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence.




Personal skills :

You conduct scientific research in an independent and upright way within a multidisciplinary environment.
You think in an innovative and creative way.
You communicate your results in a clear, concise and precise manner.
You solve problems autonomously and find alternatives or solutions.




Other skills:

The applicant shall have good knowledge of English (oral / written).
Minimum knowledge of French or Dutch is an added value for collaboration with peers.




SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

The researcher may be exposed to classified information and will therefore have to obtain the required security clearance. The candidate must consent with the background check required to obtain this clearance, which will be executed by Belgian Defense.
Only applicants with a nationality of a country that is both part of NATO and the EU will be eligible.
Working for the Patrimony requires living in Belgium for the duration of the study.




APPLICATION

Please send by email:

a CV
a scan of your ID card (both sides)

to Dr. Ir. Le Nir Vincent (vincent.lenir@mil.be ) / Prof. Dr. Ir. Mathias Becquaert (mathias.becquaert@mil.be ) and to erm-deao-rswo@mil.be

Please mention clearly the reference of the project: “SHABAM”.

Application deadline: 25/05/2025.

The interviews will take place at the Royal Military Academy, Hobbemastraat 8, 1000 Brussels. If needed, on-line interviews can be organized. The date and time of the interview will be communicated to the preselected candidates.




CONTRACT

Probable date of recruitment: from 01/06/2025, in consultation with the applicant.
Status: Full-time employment (38 hours / week) based on an open-ended contract with the Patrimony of the Royal Military Academy (you will not be a civil servant).
Please note that your contract will be open-ended, but the financing of the contract will be tied to the funding project, which is guaranteed for 3 years. There is a high chance for the project to be prolonged after this initial period, depending on the availability of new funding.
Wage scale: class A1 (holder of a Master's degree in Science or equivalent), class A2 (holder of an Ir degree or equivalent Master's in Engineering Sciences, doctor’s degree in the same area of expertise). RMA-Patrimony applies a merit-based research career track, allowing researchers to advance in wage scale based upon annual evaluations.
Holiday pay.




EXTRA LEGAL BENEFITS

Possibility to benefit from a bilingualism allowance (Dutch/French) following a SELOR test;
End-of-year bonus;
Free DKV hospitalization insurance. Possibility of additional affiliation for one or more persons living under the same roof: spouse, child(ren) (50% of the price per additional member);

Een woordje over de Nationale Loterij

Dankzij het vertrouwen van al haar spelers boekte de Nationale Loterij in 2023 een omzet van 1,49 miljard euro.

Job Description

We are seeking a Junior AI Engineer with foundational knowledge in AI, GenAI, and Machine Learning. You will join one of our AI teams and assist them in prototyping, maturing, and shipping AI features to a production-ready level.

You are a pragmatic, results-driven engineer who is eager to learn and understands modern AI stacks but thinks in terms of software reliability, performance, and user impact. You focus on creating scalable, observable solutions that solve real-world problems for our customers.

Because the role is cross-functional, the ability to communicate complex concepts in simple ways is essential. You will collaborate with product, design, front-end, and infrastructure teams to bring delightful AI features to life.

Responsibilities

As part of the AI team at Nexthink, you will:


Assist in implementing new AI features with high-quality coding standards and automated test coverage.
Support solving the engineering challenges behind data collection, retrieval, evaluation, and inference at scale.
Help build and maintain CI/CD pipelines for AI components, ensuring safe, repeatable deployments.
Instrument robust online/offline evaluation metrics and dashboards to monitor quality in production.
Proactively propose new product capabilities or improvements based on user data and technology advances.
Stay current with the rapidly evolving AI engineering ecosystem and share knowledge with the Nexthink community.
Communicate effectively with (non-technical) stakeholders such as product managers and UX designers.


Qualifications


BSc/MSc in Computer Science, Software Engineering or a related field
0-3 years of professional software-engineering experience, including internships or projects.
Basic experience in integrating with LLMs (e.g., Prompting, Evaluation, Observability).
Demonstrated interest in delivering AI-powered features that serve real users at scale (e.g., retrieval-augmented search, Generative AI assistants, predictive analytics).
Fluency in Python or at least one strongly-typed language (TypeScript or Java), with clean-code and testing discipline.
Understanding of cloud-native architectures (AWS or comparable), containerisation (Docker), and orchestration (Kubernetes / ECS).
Hands-on experience with MLOps: reproducible pipelines, automated evaluations, feature stores, CI/CD for models or prompt/embedding configs.
Strong data intuition: ability to inspect raw logs, design metrics, and quickly identify quality regressions.
Product mindset and empathy for end-users; able to translate fuzzy product requirements into incremental engineering plans.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills in English (spoken & written).


If you’re excited about joing one of the top companies working on AI and pushing the boundaries of AI we’d love to hear from you! Even if you don’t meet every requirement, we encourage you to apply—we value expertise, passion, and the drive to learn.

Culture and values

We are guided by our shared values. It's not about finding people who think and act in the same way. These values help to guide our work and will continue to strengthen it.

Thoughtful

Thoughtful at Iso is about curiosity, creativity and care. It is about good people doing good, rigorous and future-making science every single day.

Brave

Brave at Iso is about fearlessness, but it’s also about initiative and integrity. The scale of the challenge demands nothing less.

Determined

Determined at Iso is the way we pursue our goal. It’s a confidence in our hypothesis, as well as the urgency and agility needed to deliver on it. Because disease won’t wait, so neither should we.

Together

Together at Iso is about connection, collaboration across fields and catalytic relationships. It’s knowing that transformation is a group project, and remembering that what we’re doing will have a real impact on real people everywhere.

Creating An Extraordinary Company

We believe that to be successful we need a team with a range of skills and talents. We're building an environment where collaboration is fundamental, learning is shared and every employee feels supported and able to thrive. We value unique experiences, knowledge, backgrounds, and perspectives, and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact.

We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Hybrid working

It’s hugely important for us to share knowledge and build strong relationships with each other, and we find it easier to do this if we spend time together in person. This is why we follow a hybrid model, and would require you to be able to come into the office 3 days a week (currently Tuesday, Wednesday, and one other day depending on which team you’re in). If you have additional needs that would prevent you from following this hybrid approach, we’d be happy to talk through these if you’re selected for an initial screening call.

Please note that when you submit an application, your data will be processed in line with our privacy policy.

Implementing advanced testing strategies for ML-pipelines – such as simulation-based testing – to support continuous integration and ensure reliability.
Develop and maintain reliable deployment strategies for ML-pipelines and models (e.g. canary deployment).
Ensure consistent and reliable model operation across a variety of execution modes: scheduled jobs, integration within constrained optimization frameworks (Model Predictive Control), or real-time inference.
Implement and manage monitoring solutions to detect model drift, control performance drops, etc. using Grafana and Prometheus.
Orchestrate and manage containerized ML workloads using Kubernetes and Kubeflow on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Conducting peer reviews of code written by other developers, debugging issues, and optimizing overall platform performance.




What you offer

Familiarity with monitoring and alerting tools. Grafana and Prometheus is beneficial.  
Experience with PostgreSQL or similar relational databases is considered a plus. 
Independent work style, hands-on mentality, and strong teamwork skills.
Fluent in English (at least C1 level) and excellent communication skills in general.




What we offer

An international, smart, and enthusiastic team with a clear vision.
A meaningful job in a DeepTech startup committed to sustainability.
Exciting insights into the rapidly growing and emerging AI industry.
Short decision paths, flat hierarchies, and the opportunity to shape the company.
Competitive salary package, including an employee stock option plan (ESOP).
Hybrid/remote work options and flexible working hours.
A steep learning curve to accelerate your career and individual training opportunities.
Regular team events.

About Lakera

Lakera is on a mission to ensure AI does what we want it to do. We are heading towards a future where AI agents run our businesses and personal lives. Here at Lakera, we're not just dreaming about the future; we're building the security foundation for it. We empower security teams and builders so that their businesses can adopt AI technologies and unleash the next phase of intelligent computing.

We work with Fortune 500 companies, startups, and foundation model providers to protect them and their users from adversarial misalignment. We are also the company behind Gandalf, the world’s most popular AI security game.

Lakera has offices in San Francisco and Zurich.

We move fast and work with intensity. We act as one team but expect everyone to take substantial ownership and accountability. We prioritize transparency at every level and are committed to always raising the bar in everything we do. We promote diversity of thought as we believe that creates the best outcomes.

Example projects


Extend the scope of one of our detectors to support multiple languages without dropping performance on already supported languages.
Increase the scope where our defenses perform by 100x (e.g., multi-lingual data, code, etc).
Extend modeling and data generation to enable passing additional context to our prompt injection detectors, such as the LLM output and behavioral metadata.
Red team our model to understand the most pressing vulnerabilities of our detectors and prioritize the data collection and generation required to fix them.


What You’ll Bring


You have at least 4 years of experience shipping machine learning models to production, ideally in environments where reliability and quality are key (e.g., autonomous driving, industrial applications, healthcare).
Most of your experience productionizing ML models has been in unstructured data spaces such as NLP and vision.
You have had experience working on end-to-end development of ML models.
You have experience working on the “long tail” of data distribution, bringing models from prototypes to real-world systems.
You aspire to play a pivotal role in defining the future of secure AI within a mission-driven company with ambitious goals.

Hands-on experience in developing time series ML models, including feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation in Python.
Experience working with public cloud platforms, particularly Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is an advantage.
Familiarity with monitoring and alerting tools. Grafana and Prometheus is beneficial.  
Experience with PostgreSQL or similar relational databases is considered a plus. 
Independent work style, hands-on mentality, and strong teamwork skills.
Fluent in English (at least C1 level) and excellent communication skills in general.




What we offer

An international, smart, and enthusiastic team with a clear vision.
A meaningful job in a DeepTech startup committed to sustainability.
Exciting insights into the rapidly growing and emerging AI industry.
Short decision paths, flat hierarchies, and the opportunity to shape the company.
Competitive salary package, including an employee stock option plan (ESOP).
Hybrid/remote work options and flexible working hours.
A steep learning curve to accelerate your career and individual training opportunities.
Regular team events.

🤫 Worum geht’s?

Wir sind ein wachsendes Unternehmen und auf der Suche nach talentierten Applied AI Engineers, die mit uns zusammen innovative, datengetriebene Lösungen für unsere Kunden entwickeln.

Dabei geht es um spannende Projekte im Bereich Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) und maschinelles Lernen (ML), die sowohl bestehende Prozesse optimieren als auch neue Geschäftsmöglichkeiten erschließen.

🤗 Bin ich der/die „Richtige“?

Du solltest etwa +/- 2 Jahre Erfahrung im Bereich der AI- und ML-Entwicklung mitbringen. Idealerweise hast du Erfahrung in der Implementierung von Machine Learning Modellen (z.B. TensorFlow, PyTorch) und bist vertraut mit der Arbeit an kompletten ML-Pipelines, von der Datenaufbereitung bis hin zur Bereitstellung von Modellen in produktiven Umgebungen. Kenntnisse in Software-Engineering-Praktiken sind ebenfalls von Vorteil, insbesondere in Java, aber auch in weiteren Programmiersprachen wie z.B. Python, um kleinere Aufgaben schnell und effizient lösen zu können.

‍

Du strebst nach elegantem, optimiertem Code und kontinuierlicher Verbesserung deiner Fähigkeiten. Unsere erfahrenen Kollegen unterstützen dich dabei, und du gibst dieses Wissen gerne weiter. In a nutshell: Du kannst gut schlafen, wenn dein Code performant und gut getestet ist, und bist stolz auf deine Ergebnisse.

Zudem wirst du direkt mit unseren Kunden arbeiten, um ihre individuellen Herausforderungen zu verstehen und maßgeschneiderte AI-Lösungen zu entwickeln. Daher solltest du kommunikativ und aufgeschlossen sein. Unterstützung im Bereich Kundenhandling bekommst du von uns – und mit der Zeit wirst du auch in dieser Hinsicht immer sicherer.

‍

🏭 Wie arbeiten wir?

Wir folgen dem Prinzip: “Work is what you do, not where you do it”. Diese Flexibilität bieten wir dir auch, damit du dich voll auf deine Aufgaben als AI Engineer konzentrieren kannst, ohne Zeit durch unnötiges Pendeln zu verlieren.

‍

Ein paar Buzzwords aus unserem Tech-Stack: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Kubernetes, Docker, REST APIs, AWS, GCP, OpenAI, Git, MLOps.

🤓 Und wer seid ihr?

Unser Mantra: JUST FUCKING DO IT. Dieses Mantra findet sich nicht nur auf unserer kompletten Merch Collection als Aufdruck, sondern prägt unsere Company Kultur seit Anfang an. Unser Kunde hat ein scheinbar unlösbares Problem? Gibt’s nicht! Du stößt auf ein unlösbares technisches Problem? Gibt’s nicht, lösen wir zusammen! Du hast eine gute Idee und möchtest beispielsweise unsere Nerf Guns automatisiert über einen REST Service abgefeuert werden können? Wir sind dabei! Wenn du auch bei uns dabei sein möchtest, bewirb dich jetzt....

The Botnar Institute of Immune Engineering (BIIE) in Basel is seeking a mid-career Machine Learning Scientist to lead the computational efforts for one of its flagship programs. The flagship program specializes in generating large-scale antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) datasets for machine learning applications in immune receptor discovery. In this role, you will oversee a small computational team and drive the development of innovative machine learning models for protein design and immune engineering. You will work at the intersection of sequence-based and structure-based protein modeling, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning and cloud computing to advance antibody and TCR discovery.


Tasks



Technical Leadership: Lead the design and implementation of ML-driven protein modeling projects, including rapid prototyping of novel algorithms for biological sequence and structure analysis. You will plan and execute experiments with state-of-the-art models to push the boundaries of protein function prediction and design.


Protein Design & Analysis: Develop and apply machine learning methods to predict protein function from sequence and structure, and to design novel proteins (especially antibodies and TCRs) with desired properties. This includes projects focused on protein structure prediction, antibody-antigen interaction modeling, affinity maturation, epitope/paratope analysis, and assessing developability and immunogenicity of engineered proteins.


Data Integration & Pipeline Development: Oversee the curation and integration of large-scale sequence and structural datasets (internal and public) to train and validate models. Ensure robust data pipelines and collaborate with software engineers to maintain high-quality, reproducible analysis workflows, from data preprocessing to model deployment.


Collaborative Research: Work closely with automation and wet-lab scientists in iterative design-build-test cycles. Guide the design of antibodies/TCRs for experimental testing, incorporate experimental feedback into model refinement, and integrate AI/ML approaches into existing antibody engineering workflows. Collaborate with cross-functional teams (e.g. protein engineers, bioinformaticians) to translate computational predictions into real-world therapeutics.


Team Management and Mentoring: Supervise and mentor a small team of junior scientists or engineers. Provide technical guidance, code reviews, and support career development. Foster a collaborative team culture where unblocking colleagues and knowledge sharing are prioritized. Coordinate team efforts and ensure timely delivery of project milestones.


Communication and Reporting: Communicate progress, results, and recommendations clearly to stakeholders. This includes writing reports and presenting findings in group meetings, seminars, or external conferences. As a lead scientist, you will also interface with institute leadership to align on project goals and contribute to strategic decisions for the group.


Innovation and Continuous Learning: Stay current with the latest research in machine learning, bioinformatics, and protein engineering. Explore emerging techniques (e.g. protein language models or generative diffusion models) and evaluate their potential to improve project objectives. Proactively propose and implement novel solutions (technical or algorithmic) that keep the group at the cutting-edge of AI-driven protein design.

Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.
