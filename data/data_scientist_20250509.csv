Je verbetert de klantervaring door chatbots nog beter te laten reageren op vragen en sneller met de juiste oplossingen te komen. Met jouw analytisch denkvermogen en pragmatische aanpak maak je onze chatbots elke dag een beetje beter.

Wat doe je als AI Specialist bij Coolblue?

Als Generatieve AI Specialist werk je aan chatbots voor klanten om een conversationele klantreis te creëren. Je schrijft de prompt, test het prototype en evalueert op grote schaal de uitkomsten. Bij Coolblue bouwen we onze applicaties direct op de modellen van OpenAI, Google en Anthropic. Met diepe kennis van deze nieuwe technologie kunnen we innovatieve geïntegreerde oplossingen bouwen in onze huidige processen.

Als toekomstig prompt engineer schrijf jij je motivatiebrief natuurlijk met AI. Upload daarom geen motivatiebrief, maar juist het prompt waarmee je deze brief zou genereren.

Dit vind je leuk om te doen


Nieuwe kennis opdoen over Generatieve AI door trainingen en ontwikkelingen te volgen.
Best practices opzetten voor het gebruik van Generatieve AI binnen Coolblue.
Intensief samenwerken met diverse domeinen om AI-toepassingen in hun vakgebied te ontdekken.
Waarde aantonen door prototypes te maken in Langchain.
Systematisch uitkomsten evalueren door prompts niet 1 keer, maar 1000 keer automatisch te testen.
Je kennis delen via demo’s, trainingen en als sparringpartner binnen Coolblue.


Hier herken jij jezelf in


Een afgeronde hbo- of wo- opleiding.
Minimaal 3 jaar ervaring met het schrijven van Python code.
Onstilbare honger naar nieuws over Generative AI, ervaring in Langchain is een pré.
Weet ChatGPT om de tuin te leiden met je prompts. Nieuwe (technische) kennis maak jij je snel eigen.
Analytisch en Pragmatisch en niet vies van een hacky oplossing.
Communicatief ijzersterk in het Nederlands én in het Engels


Dit zoek jij verder in een baan


Geld.
Meer dan 30 trainingen in onze eigen Studiefabriek.
Korting op alle spullen die we verkopen.
25 vakantiedagen. Als je belooft dat je terugkomt.
Reiskostenvergoeding en pensioenregeling.
Een kantoor waar je foto's van wilt maken op een toplocatie. Vanaf Rotterdam Centraal is het 3 keer vallen voor je er bent. Oké, het is 2 minuten lopen.
Ongekend goede werksfeer. Met versbereide happen, maandelijkse borrels, legendarische Coolblue-feesten, de leukste teamactiviteiten en een informele, speelse afdeling.
Ruimte voor nieuwe initiatieven en ideeën. Daar staan we altijd voor open. Of je nu een week, maand of een jaar bij ons werkt.
Uitdagend werk om helemaal in op te gaan, zodat je af en toe vergeet dat je aan het werk bent.
Een platte organisatie in de breedste zin van het woord. Zo kun je gewoon een biertje drinken met de baas.

Are you looking for a place to graduate where you can gain hands-on experience in deploying, scaling, and maintaining AI-driven solutions? Do you want to bridge the gap between machine learning and production systems? Then join our team as an ML Engineering intern!

Why? 🤔

At Enjins we want to make Machine Learning solutions that are here to stay. Our mission is to become the go-to ML engineering company in the world of tech scale-ups, for both talent and customers.

How? 🚀

We are driven by impact, and so is our vision on Machine Learning. We don't want a data scientists' laptop to be a graveyard for brilliant models. That's why we created an approach that allows us to actually implement Machine Learning that realises business value. This approach demands our ML engineers to stand out in engineering, data science and consulting skills.

What? [You'll be doing] 👀

We are looking for an intern to strengthen our team in one of two exciting graduation projects. You'll work on innovative AI solutions, focusing on automation, deployment, and optimization of machine learning systems. Your research and implementation will contribute directly to real-world applications, working closely with our AI engineers in a dynamic environment of start- and scaleups.

Your responsibilities:


Design, develop, and optimize AI pipelines for scalable deployment.
Research best practices for monitoring, versioning, and automating AI workflows.
Implement solutions that enhance the efficiency and reliability of AI models in production.
Collaborate with a small team to bring innovative AI solutions to life.



Your graduation project options:


Oddit: We are currently developing an LLM-based application called Oddit that is able to create AI roadmaps and strategies based on inputs such as interviews, data quality scans and code reviews. Basically, we automate our own workflow. Within this project there are plenty GenAI research angles, that will have direct impact on our product (Oddit).
Your AI Engineering Pitch: Bring your own AI engineering topic related to our focus industries ClimateTech, Marketplaces, or Mobility. Whether it's optimizing an AI model performance in Energy, improving real-time data pipelines in a geospatial setting, or enhancing the AI system scalability for a large platform, we encourage you to pitch an AI idea that aligns with our focus industry.


Starting date: 1st of June or July: 4-6 months

Requirements

Who are you?:🚶‍♀️


You're graduating in a Master's Degree in AI, Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a similar (technical) field.
You have some experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
You're familiar with Python and have experience with CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and model deployment.
You are pragmatic, proactive, and thrive in small, agile teams.
You are fluent in at least English.
You like to build stuff; preferably you have an ambition to grow your skills in both software as well as AI/ML.



Benefits

What to expect from us: ⚡️

We look for people that want to enjoy the ride of a start-up and benefit from the freedom in the role:


A team of talented and ambitious ML engineers.
Insights into real-world AI challenges and deployment strategies.
The possibility of a full-time position as AI engineer at Enjins after your internship.

Wat ga je doen?

Als data scientist houd je je bezig met onderzoek naar en de ontwikkeling en toepassing van data science-methoden zoals machine learning die bijdragen aan operationele vraagstukken binnen de politieorganisatie. Je werkt aan uiteenlopende projecten, zoals exploratieve data-analyses of het ontwikkelen en evalueren van modellen voor het classificeren van informatie in brondata. Je draagt bij aan maatschappelijk relevante ontwikkelingen en de beweging van datagedreven werken binnen de politie. Je maakt deel uit van een nationaal samenwerkingsverband waarin verschillende Business Intelligence en Kwaliteit (BI&K)-expertisegebieden actief zijn. In samenwerking met specialisten uit deze expertisegebieden werk je aan oplossingen voor vraagstukken uit de politiepraktijk en draag je bij aan de implementatie en het beheer daarvan. Je werkt op een landelijk data- en analytics-platform waar brondata geïntegreerd beschikbaar is voor dataexploratie en de ontwikkeling en exploitatie van modellen.

Waar ga je werken?

Je komt te werken bij het Team Business Intelligence. Dit team houdt zich bezig met de ontwikkeling van oplossingen om onze collega’s en verschillende ketenpartners van de juiste informatie te voorzien. Het team ontwikkelt en beheert standaardproducten en analyseoplossingen en draagt actief bij aan landelijke ontwikkelingen binnen het intelligencedomein en daarbuiten zoals thematisch en datagedreven werken.

Je onderscheidt gemakkelijk hoofd- en bijzaken en brengt informatie uit diverse bronnen met elkaar in verband. Je kunt analyses omzetten in concrete oplossingen en feiten kun je helder en gestructureerd vastleggen en presenteren. Je signaleert kansen en bent alert op trends, ontwikkelingen en jurisprudentie en hebt oog voor ethische en maatschappelijke aspecten die je werk raken. Je kunt zelfstandig werken waarbij je proactief op zoek gaat naar nieuwe mogelijkheden en kansen.

About Us

We are Xomnia, the AI consulting company. We’re curious problem solvers who believe data will change the way we live, work and communicate. Being at the forefront of this revolutionary change in a sustainable, positive way is what drives us.

We solve challenging data science and engineering projects, from start to finish. From developing an application for real-time fraud detection on Google Cloud Platform, to setting up a customized recommender engine in an existing Microsoft Azure environment - we develop and deploy tailor-made data science solutions.

Xomnia started in 2013 in one room in the heart of Amsterdam. These days we take up nearly two houses. But more than just a workspace, we're a community that values authenticity. Here, everyone is encouraged to be themselves, to learn, and to have fun in the process.

Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.




We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.

If you're experienced, passionate, and align with our values, we want to hear from you.

Are you passionate about data and location? Does the complexity of what lies beneath our feet excite you just as much as the challenges of working with large databases? Do you have hands-on experience in operationalizing AI solutions? Join TNO – Geological Survey of the Netherlands (TNO-GDN) in Utrecht as a Data Scientist and make your mark on the future.

What will be your role?

At TNO-GDN, we turn geological data into 3D models of the subsurface to help the Netherlands better understand what’s happening underground.

Subsurface information plays a vital role in spatial planning (think large infrastructure or construction projects), the energy transition (such as geothermal energy and storage), safety (like earthquakes and dike monitoring), and climate adaptation (including drought and drinking water). With the help of data and models, we explore the potential of the subsurface, assess how to use it sustainably, and advise on opportunities and risks.

The Netherlands holds an enormous wealth of subsurface data, managed by TNO-GDN in the BRO (Key Register of the Subsurface) and the DINO database. Turning this data into a model, analysis, or AI solution that’s ready for internal or external use involves many steps. That’s where you come in. With your enthusiasm for data and passion for the Dutch subsurface, you’ll help make complex data clear and accessible using innovative techniques. Your work will directly support one of the largest programmes within TNO and contribute to solving major challenges in energy, water, and critical materials.

What We Expect From You

As a Geo Data Scientist, you’ll work in a multidisciplinary team within the GeoData & Information Management department. Expect a dynamic group of developers, database specialists, and geoscientists. Together, you’ll develop new ways to gain insights from subsurface data. About 60% of your time will be dedicated to research and development of AI solutions. The remaining 40% will be spent on putting those solutions into production—together with MLOps experts, cloud engineers, and infrastructure specialists.

You’re curious and eager to grow your skills in programming, (geo)statistics, machine learning, and AI deployment. Thanks to your creativity and proactive attitude, you quickly absorb new knowledge and apply it to real-world challenges. Your strong communication skills help you share your insights with colleagues from different backgrounds and a wider audience. You keep up with the latest AI developments and take ownership of your projects.

What you bring


A degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Geo Statistics, Earth Sciences, or a related field.
At least 5 years of experience in applied AI projects, with solutions deployed to broad internal or external user groups (or even at enterprise level).
Affinity with geosciences or geospatial data science is a plus.
A creative problem-solver with a solution-driven mindset.
Enthusiastic about learning new technologies and software.
Able to explain complex theories or problems in a clear and simple way.
A collaborative team player who can also work independently.

De essentie


Wie: een enthousiast beginnend werkende met technische aanleg en intrinsiek enthousiasme voor AI en Large Language Models.
Wat: meewerken aan onze development roadmap voor de conversie van WordPress (PHP) naar Sanity (JavaScript), slimmer gebruik van AI voor code review, het testen van applicaties en om creatieve AI-oplossingen bedenken.
Waar: een dynamische werkomgeving op het snijvlak van LLM, DevOps en Prompting.
Waarom: omdat je graag experimenteert met AI-technologie, je development-skills wilt verbeteren én tegelijkertijd ons helpt innoveren. Jij leert van ons, wij leren van jou - een perfecte uitwisseling dus!


Dit Ga Je Doen

Samen met het development team ga je verder op ontdekkingsreis in de wereld van AI. Je werkt onder andere mee aan onze transitie van WordPress naar Sanity, waarbij we optimaal gebruik willen maken van Large Language Models. Je denkt mee over creatieve toepassingen, experimenteert met nieuwe technieken en helpt ons om slimmer te werken met AI. Het belangrijkste is dat we samen de grenzen van AI, Agents, RAG, etc. ontdekken.

Dit Is Het Development Team

Dit vragen wij van jou


Je hebt al veel met AI geëxperimenteerd. Agents, RAG, Gemini, Model chaining en Ollama zijn voor jou bekende woorden.
Je krijgt energie van het ontdekken van nieuwe mogelijkheden met AI
Je bent primair development gedreven en altijd op zoek naar creatieve oplossingen
Kennis van WordPress (PHP) en/of Sanity (JavaScript) is een pre, maar geen must
Lokaal draaien van modellen Modellen en ze aansturen met code heb je vaker gedaan.
We vinden het belangrijk dat je zoveel mogelijk op locatie werkt bij ons en dat je woonachtig bent in Nederland!


Hoe is het om

bij Kaliber te werken?

Loop je weleens over de Zeedijk in Utrecht? Dan heb je ons misschien al gespot. Net naast koffiehuis Dagger, recht aan rivier de Vecht werken wij met 60-ish collega’s in de voormalige broodjesfabriek ‘de Lubro’. Daar maken we, bedenken we, knutselen we, experimenteren we, stickeren we, dansen we, eten we - en springt er soms iemand in een ballenbak. Of verandert het toilet in een discotheek. Wat we vooral in de Lubro doen, is zoveel mogelijk werk maken waar onze opdrachtgevers héél, héél blij van worden. En wij zelf ook.

Dit Krijg Je Bij Ons


Een uitdagend traineeship van 12 maanden met uitzicht op een vaste aanstelling
Persoonlijke begeleiding vanuit het development team, met persoonlijke ondersteuning
Een uitgebreid leer- en ontwikkeltraject om je AI-skills naar een professioneel niveau te tillen
Praktijkervaring in het werken met de nieuwste AI-technologieën
Ruimte voor eigen initiatief en ideeën
Mooi salaris


Cases die we graag delen

We Werken Het Liefste Aan Projecten Waar We Onze Tanden In Kunnen Zetten. Iets Vernieuwends, Uitdagends. Werk Dat Waarde Toevoegt. Af En Toe Winnen We Een Award Met De Oplossingen Die We Bedenken, Maar Dat Vinden We Niet Het Belangrijkste. Het Is Het Werk Zelf Dat Telt. Zoals


Een gepersonaliseerd platform voor Jumbo
Een verfrissende comeback van de 90's hit 'No Limit' voor VodafoneZiggo
Een carrière bij bol begint op dit platform dat wij maakten
Een AI-gedreven Career Coach op de site voor Team EIFFEL


We maken ook graag werk dat buiten de kaders van je computer- of telefoonscherm reikt:


Een AI photobooth die Redditors fascineert
Een WC waarmee we hard gingen op TikTok
Gamification voor gedetineerden
Een interactieve AI installatie die bier bedenkt


Klaar om te solliciteren?

Kriebelt het al? Zin om bij Kaliber aan de slag te gaan? Reageer dan met een korte motivatie en je cv.

We lezen je bericht en als we enthousiast zijn, dan nodigen we je graag uit voor een kennismakingsgesprek. Hierin vertellen wij alles over Kaliber en horen we graag meer over jou. Heb je vragen? Neem dan gerust contact op met Lobke Broers, Talent & Office Manager, via lobke@kaliber.net of 030 287 64 00. Wie weet tot binnenkort!

Please note: due to the nature of our work, you'll need professional Dutch proficiency to rock this job.

En recruiters: we waarderen jullie enthousiasme, maar we regelen onze vacatures liever zelf. Geen acquisitie dus, bedankt!

Als data scientist houd je je bezig met onderzoek naar en de ontwikkeling en toepassing van data science-methoden zoals machine learning die bijdragen aan operationele vraagstukken binnen de politieorganisatie. Je werkt aan uiteenlopende projecten, zoals exploratieve data-analyses of het ontwikkelen en evalueren van modellen voor het classificeren van informatie in brondata. Je draagt bij aan maatschappelijk relevante ontwikkelingen en de beweging van datagedreven werken binnen de politie. Je maakt deel uit van een nationaal samenwerkingsverband waarin verschillende Business Intelligence en Kwaliteit (BI&K)-expertisegebieden actief zijn. In samenwerking met specialisten uit deze expertisegebieden werk je aan oplossingen voor vraagstukken uit de politiepraktijk en draag je bij aan de implementatie en het beheer daarvan. Je werkt op een landelijk data- en analytics-platform waar brondata geïntegreerd beschikbaar is voor dataexploratie en de ontwikkeling en exploitatie van modellen.

Waar ga je werken?

Je onderscheidt gemakkelijk hoofd- en bijzaken en brengt informatie uit diverse bronnen met elkaar in verband. Je kunt analyses omzetten in concrete oplossingen en feiten kun je helder en gestructureerd vastleggen en presenteren. Je signaleert kansen en bent alert op trends, ontwikkelingen en jurisprudentie en hebt oog voor ethische en maatschappelijke aspecten die je werk raken. Je kunt zelfstandig werken waarbij je proactief op zoek gaat naar nieuwe mogelijkheden en kansen.

Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.




We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.

If you're experienced, passionate, and align with our values, we want to hear from you.

Hoe is het om

bij Kaliber te werken?

Loop je weleens over de Zeedijk in Utrecht? Dan heb je ons misschien al gespot. Net naast koffiehuis Dagger, recht aan rivier de Vecht werken wij met 60-ish collega’s in de voormalige broodjesfabriek ‘de Lubro’. Daar maken we, bedenken we, knutselen we, experimenteren we, stickeren we, dansen we, eten we - en springt er soms iemand in een ballenbak. Of verandert het toilet in een discotheek. Wat we vooral in de Lubro doen, is zoveel mogelijk werk maken waar onze opdrachtgevers héél, héél blij van worden. En wij zelf ook.

Dit Krijg Je Bij Ons


Een uitdagend traineeship van 12 maanden met uitzicht op een vaste aanstelling
Persoonlijke begeleiding vanuit het development team, met persoonlijke ondersteuning
Een uitgebreid leer- en ontwikkeltraject om je AI-skills naar een professioneel niveau te tillen
Praktijkervaring in het werken met de nieuwste AI-technologieën
Ruimte voor eigen initiatief en ideeën
Mooi salaris

We Werken Het Liefste Aan Projecten Waar We Onze Tanden In Kunnen Zetten. Iets Vernieuwends, Uitdagends. Werk Dat Waarde Toevoegt. Af En Toe Winnen We Een Award Met De Oplossingen Die We Bedenken, Maar Dat Vinden We Niet Het Belangrijkste. Het Is Het Werk Zelf Dat Telt. Zoals


Een gepersonaliseerd platform voor Jumbo
Een verfrissende comeback van de 90's hit 'No Limit' voor VodafoneZiggo
Een carrière bij bol begint op dit platform dat wij maakten
Een AI-gedreven Career Coach op de site voor Team EIFFEL


We maken ook graag werk dat buiten de kaders van je computer- of telefoonscherm reikt:


Een AI photobooth die Redditors fascineert
Een WC waarmee we hard gingen op TikTok
Gamification voor gedetineerden
Een interactieve AI installatie die bier bedenkt


Klaar om te solliciteren?

Kriebelt het al? Zin om bij Kaliber aan de slag te gaan? Reageer dan met een korte motivatie en je cv.

We lezen je bericht en als we enthousiast zijn, dan nodigen we je graag uit voor een kennismakingsgesprek. Hierin vertellen wij alles over Kaliber en horen we graag meer over jou. Heb je vragen?

Data Scientist

The Opportunity:

As a data scientist, you’re excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set, and you’re fascinated by the possibilities presented by IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open new opportunities. As a data scientist at Booz Allen, you can help turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors—from fraud detection to cancer research to national intelligence—we need you to help find the answers in the data.

On our team, you’ll use your analytical skills and data science knowledge to create real-world impact. You’ll work closely with your clients to understand their questions and needs, and then dig into their data-rich environments to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll develop algorithms and systems and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn sets of disparate data points into objective answers to help clients make informed decisions. Ultimately, you’ll provide a deep understanding of the data, what it all means, and how it can be used.

Work with us as we use data science for good.

Join us. The world can’t wait.

You Have:  


2+ years of experience with data exploration, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, or data mining
2+ years of experience with statistical and general-purpose programming languages for data analysis

Experience in working independently, including with the entire analytics development process
Knowledge of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Natural Language Processing
Knowledge of Advana
TS/SCI clearance
Bachelor’s degree



Nice If You Have:  


2+ years of experience in the development of algorithms leveraging R, Python, or SQL and NoSQL
2+ years of experience with Distributed data or computing tools, including MapReduce, Hadoop, Hive, EMR, Kafka, Spark, Gurobi, or MySQL
Experience with Palantir Products

As a data scientist, you’re excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set, and you’re fascinated by the possibilities presented by IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open new opportunities. As a data scientist at Booz Allen, you can help turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors—from fraud detection to cancer research to national intelligence—we need you to help find the answers in the data.

On our team, you’ll use your analytical skills and data science knowledge to create real-world impact. You’ll work closely with your clients to understand their questions and needs, and then dig into their data-rich environments to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll develop algorithms and systems and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn sets of disparate data points into objective answers to help clients make informed decisions. Ultimately, you’ll provide a deep understanding of the data, what it all means, and how it can be used.

Unternehmensprofil

„Am Anfang schaute ich mich um, konnte aber den Wagen, von dem ich träumte, nicht finden. Also beschloss ich, ihn mir selbst zu bauen.“

Dieser Satz von Ferry Porsche bringt alles auf den Punkt, was Porsche ausmacht. Als Marke, als Unternehmen, als Automobilhersteller, als Arbeitgeber. Die „Idee Porsche“ hat so einzigartige Sportwagen wie den Porsche 356 oder den 911 hervorgebracht. Durch die Kombination von Tradition und Innovation mit den Porsche typischen, manchmal etwas unkonventionellen Denkweisen unserer Mitarbeiter, lassen wir automobile Träume wahr werden und haben so immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick. Porsche ist allerdings viel mehr als ""nur"" ein exklusiver Sportwagenhersteller. Denn auch als Arbeitgeber hat Porsche viel zu bieten: vielfältige Einstiegs- und Karrieremöglichkeiten, Maßnahmen zur Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie sowie flexible Arbeitszeitmodelle.

Exklusive Einblicke hinter die Kulissen

Unabhängig von dem, was andere tun, sind wir stets bestrebt, unsere Grenzen ständig neu zu definieren und Maßstäbe zu setzen. Das können wir heute und in Zukunft aber nur mit Mitarbeitern und Führungskräften erreichen, die immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick haben.

Exklusive Einblicke in die Porsche Arbeitswelt erhalten Sie auch auf unseren Karriereprofilen in den sozialen Netzwerken:

Das Programm

Das Robert Bosch Centrum für Innovation im Gesundheitswesen fördert im Rahmen einer Partnerschaft zwischen dem Bosch Health Campus Stuttgart (koordiniert durch den Bosch Digital Innovation Hub (BDIH)) und der ETH Zürich (koordiniert durch das ETH AI Center) gemeinsame KI-Forschungsstipendien für Nachwuchswissenschaftler (m/w/d). Mit dem Stipendienprogramm wollen die beiden Einrichtungen innovative Ansätze in der KI-Forschung entwickeln und so die Gesundheitsversorgung der Zukunft verbessern.

Das Centrum für Medizinische Datenintegration

Das Centrum für Medizinische Datenintegration (meDIC) hat zum Ziel, die vielfältigen klinischen Daten der Regelversorgung am Robert Bosch Krankenhaus für die medizinische Forschung zugänglich zu machen. Hierzu werden technische Lösungen erarbeitet sowie organisatorische und regulatorische Rahmenbedingungen geschaffen. Das meDIC übernimmt damit sowohl eine verbindende Rolle zwischen Medizin und Informatik, als auch zwischen klinischer Behandlung und medizinischer Forschung. Als zentrale Einrichtung am BHC für die Entwicklung innovativer digitaler Lösungen für eine patientenzentriete und personalisierte Versorgung und Forschung werden am meDIC bereits heute vielfältige Projekte in enger Kooperation mit den Forschern und Klinikern am Campus umgesetzt. Ein besonderer Fokus liegt hierbei auf der Entwicklung und Implementierung von KI basierten Systemen zur Optimierung der Patientenversorgung sowie der klinischen Prozesse. Im Rahmen des BHC-ETH Stipendienprogramms ist eine Fellowship-Position am meDIC zu besetzen.

Stellenbeschreibung

Ein langjähriges aktives Forschungsfeld des meDICs ist die automatisierte Erkennung und Vorhersage von Komplikationen, insbesondere auf der Intensivstation nach schweren chirurgischen Eingriffen. Hierbei ist das Ziel, die aus unterschiedlichen Quellen erzeugten Datenmengen so auszuwerten, dass die auf den relevanten Stationen tätigen Ärzt:innen und Pflegekräfte frühzeitig auf sich anbahnende schwerwiegende Komplikationen hingewiesen werden, um schnell und zielgerichtet einschreiten zu können. In enger Kooperation mit der Herzchirurgie und der Nephrologie wurden bereits sehr umfangreiche Vorarbeiten und vielversprechende Ergebnisse entwickelt und publiziert. Diese beinhalten auch innovative KI Modelle insbesondere für die Vorhersage von akutem Nierenversagen.

Im Rahmen des Stipendiums sollen diese Entwicklungen fortgeführt werden und für den Einsatz in der Regelversorgung weiterentwickelt werden. Ziel ist insbesondere:


Eine Verbesserung und Generalisierung bestehender KI Modelle unter Verwendung multimodaler Daten (Texte, Zeitreihen, …)
Die Einbindung und Zusammenführung weiterer klinischer Datenentitäten aus verschiedenen Quellsystemen
Die Planung und Durchführung einer praxisnahen Erprobung der entwickelten Funktionalitäten unter Begleitung des Fachbereichs
Die Entwicklung und Implementierung von Software Schnittstellen (bspw. REST-APIs) in einer hoch regulierten IT Infrastruktur
Die Umsetzung interner Softwarekomponenten zur Weiterentwicklung existierender Automatisierungsprozesse (ETL-Strecken)
Die Überführung des Projekts in eine nachhaltige Betriebsstruktur


Qualifikationen


Abgeschlossene Promotion der Informatik, Mathematik, Kybernetik, Medizintechnik oder vergleichbarem Schwerpunkt
Berufserfahrung im Bereich Medizininformatik und/oder KI Entwicklung
Erfahrung im IT-Umfeld und ausgezeichnete Kenntnisse in mindestens einer Programmiersprache (vorzugsweise R oder Python)
Vorkenntnisse in folgenden Technologien: Linux, R/Python, REST-API, GIT, SQL, HL7/FHIR, Pytorch/Tensorflow, Zeitreihenanalyse, GPUs, OOP
Eigeninitiative, Team-Fähigkeit und eine selbständige sowie lösungsorientierte Arbeitsweise
Sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift


Zusätzliche Informationen

Wir bieten Ihnen:


Teilnahme am BHC-ETH Fellowship Programm
Ein interessantes Aufgabengebiet mit vielseitigen Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten
Mitarbeit in einem engagierten Team, geprägt von gegenseitiger Wertschätzung und Unterstützung
Eine leistungsgerechte Vergütung mit zusätzlicher Altersversorgung sowie ein bezuschusstes Jobticket

Our goal is a solar power system on every roof, a storage unit in every house, and an e-car in every garage. How are we achieving this? Enpal makes solar easy: we rent out solar power systems, electricity storage and wallboxes at an all-inclusive rate, supplemented by a low-cost green electricity tariff, and intelligently networked into an integrated overall solution.

We are just at the beginning of our journey to becoming Europe's largest energy company. That's why we're looking for talented people to accompany us on this journey, leave their footprint and celebrate successes together with us. At Enpal, you will find a dynamic working environment as well as the space to develop yourself personally and professionally and to use your strengths effectively.

As the first green unicorn in Germany and the fastest-growing energy company in Europe (FT1000 Ranking 2022 by Financial Times & Statista), we continue to advance our mission of green energy for everyone. Be part of this success story and change the world with us!

Job Description

As a (Senior) Software Engineer (f/m/d) you will work on complex problems in delivering renewable energy solutions: from digitalizing the planning of installation of solar panels with compelling frontend applications, to building APIs supporting real time energy data, all the way to scaling and operating cloud infrastructure in Azure.

We offer speed, agility, and steep career growth. Our vision to make sustainable solar energy available to everyone can only come to live through our customer and product oriented view, and the cooperation between software development, product management and lean, experiment-driven business development.

Join us to develop your professional skills, take part in the energy revolution, and let us take ownership of the sustainable change we want to see in the world together! We are looking forward to your application.

At Enpal, you would be


building software. We are serious about delivering incremental value in each iteration, and we celebrate when we improve people's experience with our solution, make an impact towards our climate goals.
improving developer happiness. Nobody wants to stay up until midnight to deploy new solutions, or run the same regression tests manually day in, day out. We're about improving stability, automating as much as we can including load tests and vulnerability scans.
growing & learning. Do you know all there is to know about Kafka or are you experienced on graceful degradation? We’d love to learn from your knowledge. Feel like you're behind on test-driven development in React, is Azure Bicep new to you? We’ll make sure you grow through our knowledge.
working on architecture & vision. We are fusing old and new technologies; cloud-native microservices, IoT applications, a Salesforce backbone, an event-driven architecture. This means we analyze new requirements critically to see which moving parts would have to change, explore opportunities to solve organization-spanning challenges with elegant architectural solutions.
steering for empathy and understanding. Only when we comprehend what the market needs we can create solutions that truly address underlying challenges. Ask critical questions and listen to operations, craftspeople, sales - there are so many stakeholders and users to get input from, and balancing their needs leads to the best solutions.



Qualifications


Proven Experience in Building Quality Products: You have a track record of delivering high-quality software products that are scalable, flexible, maintainable, and testable.
End-to-end Ownership: You can independently set up and manage pipelines, infrastructure and deployment of your code, without relying on dedicated DevOps/Infrastructure team.
Cloud Infrastructure Experience: You have enough experience working with cloud infrastructure to be able to manage the full implementation of these services into your projects.
Tech Stack Flexibility: While our core technologies include C# and Node.js, we welcome candidates with diverse tech backgrounds. What matters most is your eagerness to learn and work with our stack upon joining.
Microservices & Architecture Design: You have experience with microservice architecture and strong knowledge of software architecture design patterns, including Event Driven Architecture.
Additional Tech Experience: Experience with React, MongoDB, Flutter, and Salesforce is a bonus, though not required.
Collaborative and Open to Feedback: You thrive in collaborative environments, actively contribute to team discussions, and are open to both giving and receiving feedback. You're a positive force for change within your team and beyond.
Strong Communication Skills: You communicate ideas clearly and concisely in both written and spoken English. Knowledge of German is an advantage.
Passion for Energy Transition: You are inspired by the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. As one of the largest players in the solar industry, we are committed to making a positive impact—and we want you to join us in this mission.
Agile and Lean Mindset: You embody agile and lean values, prioritizing people over processes, and code over documentation. You focus on reducing waste by building minimum viable products (MVPs), testing them with real users, and evolving solutions as requirements grow.

Unternehmensprofil

„Am Anfang schaute ich mich um, konnte aber den Wagen, von dem ich träumte, nicht finden. Also beschloss ich, ihn mir selbst zu bauen.“

Dieser Satz von Ferry Porsche bringt alles auf den Punkt, was Porsche ausmacht. Als Marke, als Unternehmen, als Automobilhersteller, als Arbeitgeber. Die „Idee Porsche“ hat so einzigartige Sportwagen wie den Porsche 356 oder den 911 hervorgebracht. Durch die Kombination von Tradition und Innovation mit den Porsche typischen, manchmal etwas unkonventionellen Denkweisen unserer Mitarbeiter, lassen wir automobile Träume wahr werden und haben so immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick. Porsche ist allerdings viel mehr als ""nur"" ein exklusiver Sportwagenhersteller. Denn auch als Arbeitgeber hat Porsche viel zu bieten: vielfältige Einstiegs- und Karrieremöglichkeiten, Maßnahmen zur Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie sowie flexible Arbeitszeitmodelle.

Exklusive Einblicke hinter die Kulissen

Unabhängig von dem, was andere tun, sind wir stets bestrebt, unsere Grenzen ständig neu zu definieren und Maßstäbe zu setzen. Das können wir heute und in Zukunft aber nur mit Mitarbeitern und Führungskräften erreichen, die immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick haben.

Exklusive Einblicke in die Porsche Arbeitswelt erhalten Sie auch auf unseren Karriereprofilen in den sozialen Netzwerken:

Anforderungen

Wohnsitz: Nur für Bewerber aus Deutschland

Sprache: Deutsch - Muttersprachliches Niveau


Du hast ein abgeschlossenes Studium im Bereich Technische Kybernetik, Mechatronik, Maschinenbau oder eine vergleichbare Qualifikation und möchtest deine Kenntnisse in einem praxisnahen Umfeld einbringen? Dann bist du bei uns richtig.
Du bringst eine gesunde Neugier mit, gepaart mit dem Wunsch, experimentell zu arbeiten und die gewonnenen Daten systematisch auszuwerten. Dabei gehst du eigenverantwortlich und mit hoher Eigenmotivation an neue Herausforderungen heran – sei es beim Erlernen neuer Methoden oder beim Lösen technischer Fragestellungen.
Deine analytische Stärke ergänzt du durch Teamgeist und ausgeprägte Kommunikationsfähigkeiten, mit denen du dich aktiv in unser dynamisches Entwicklungsteam einbringst. Idealerweise hast du bereits Erfahrung in Versuchsplanung, Datenanalyse und Systemdynamik gesammelt. Kenntnisse in Matlab, Python oder GIT sind von Vorteil – aber kein Muss, wenn du bereit bist, dich schnell einzuarbeiten.


Tätigkeiten


In deiner Rolle entwickelst du Validierungsszenarien mit Fokus auf Druckqualität, Dynamik und Genauigkeit, um Weiterentwicklungen und neue Funktionalitäten an unserem 3D-Betondrucker systematisch zu evaluieren. Du führst präzise Messungen zur Druckgenauigkeit und zum dynamischen Verhalten des Drucksystems durch und leitest daraus konkrete Optimierungspotenziale ab.
Darüber hinaus definierst du eine skalierbare Dateninfrastruktur für die Analyse umfangreicher Zeitreihen – stets mit dem Ziel, deine Lösungen nahtlos in unsere durchgängige, interoperable Toollandschaft zu integrieren. Als zentrale Ansprechperson für die Datenauswertung übernimmst du Verantwortung für die Analyseprozesse und treibst datenbasierte Entscheidungsgrundlagen aktiv voran.
Du identifizierst Fehlerursachen, entwickelst fundierte Lösungsvorschläge und teilst deine Erkenntnisse mit Kolleg:innen aus Entwicklung und Baustellenteam. In enger Abstimmung mit internen wie externen Stakeholdern leistest du so einen maßgeblichen Beitrag zur kontinuierlichen Verbesserung unseres 3D-Druckprozesses.


Team

Bei INSTATIQ wirst du Teil eines hochmotivierten, interdisziplinären Teams, das mit Leidenschaft an der Digitalisierung und Automatisierung des Bauens arbeitet. Unsere Kultur ist geprägt von flachen Hierarchien, kurzen Entscheidungswegen und echtem Gestaltungswillen – jede Meinung zählt, jede Idee kann den Unterschied machen. In deiner Rolle arbeitest du direkt unter dem CTO und bist damit nah an der technischen Strategie des Unternehmens beteiligt. Du bringst dein Know-how unmittelbar in richtungsweisende Entscheidungen ein und gestaltest gemeinsam mit dem CTO und dem Team zukunftsfähige Softwarelösungen, die reale Probleme lösen und echte Wirkung entfalten. Bei uns findest du ein dynamisches Umfeld, in dem Innovation nicht nur gefordert, sondern aktiv gefördert wird – mit Raum für Eigenverantwortung, technologische Exzellenz und persönliches Wachstum.

Über das Unternehmen

Wir bei INSTATIQ revolutionieren die Baubranche mit unserer innovativen 3D-Betondruck-Technologie. Als Startup und Spinoff der Putzmeister Unternehmensgruppe verbinden wir technologische Exzellenz mit nachhaltigen Lösungen. Unser Ziel ist es, den Bauprozess effizienter, umweltfreundlicher und zukunftssicher zu machen.

Our goal is a solar power system on every roof, a storage unit in every house, and an e-car in every garage. How are we achieving this? Enpal makes solar easy: we rent out solar power systems, electricity storage and wallboxes at an all-inclusive rate, supplemented by a low-cost green electricity tariff, and intelligently networked into an integrated overall solution.

We are just at the beginning of our journey to becoming Europe's largest energy company. That's why we're looking for talented people to accompany us on this journey, leave their footprint and celebrate successes together with us. At Enpal, you will find a dynamic working environment as well as the space to develop yourself personally and professionally and to use your strengths effectively.

As the first green unicorn in Germany and the fastest-growing energy company in Europe (FT1000 Ranking 2022 by Financial Times & Statista), we continue to advance our mission of green energy for everyone. Be part of this success story and change the world with us!

Job Description

As a (Senior) Software Engineer (f/m/d) you will work on complex problems in delivering renewable energy solutions: from digitalizing the planning of installation of solar panels with compelling frontend applications, to building APIs supporting real time energy data, all the way to scaling and operating cloud infrastructure in Azure.

We offer speed, agility, and steep career growth. Our vision to make sustainable solar energy available to everyone can only come to live through our customer and product oriented view, and the cooperation between software development, product management and lean, experiment-driven business development.

Join us to develop your professional skills, take part in the energy revolution, and let us take ownership of the sustainable change we want to see in the world together! We are looking forward to your application.

At Enpal, you would be


building software. We are serious about delivering incremental value in each iteration, and we celebrate when we improve people's experience with our solution, make an impact towards our climate goals.
improving developer happiness. Nobody wants to stay up until midnight to deploy new solutions, or run the same regression tests manually day in, day out. We're about improving stability, automating as much as we can including load tests and vulnerability scans.
growing & learning. Do you know all there is to know about Kafka or are you experienced on graceful degradation? We’d love to learn from your knowledge. Feel like you're behind on test-driven development in React, is Azure Bicep new to you? We’ll make sure you grow through our knowledge.
working on architecture & vision. We are fusing old and new technologies; cloud-native microservices, IoT applications, a Salesforce backbone, an event-driven architecture. This means we analyze new requirements critically to see which moving parts would have to change, explore opportunities to solve organization-spanning challenges with elegant architectural solutions.
steering for empathy and understanding. Only when we comprehend what the market needs we can create solutions that truly address underlying challenges. Ask critical questions and listen to operations, craftspeople, sales - there are so many stakeholders and users to get input from, and balancing their needs leads to the best solutions.



Qualifications


Proven Experience in Building Quality Products: You have a track record of delivering high-quality software products that are scalable, flexible, maintainable, and testable.
End-to-end Ownership: You can independently set up and manage pipelines, infrastructure and deployment of your code, without relying on dedicated DevOps/Infrastructure team.
Cloud Infrastructure Experience: You have enough experience working with cloud infrastructure to be able to manage the full implementation of these services into your projects.
Tech Stack Flexibility: While our core technologies include C# and Node.js, we welcome candidates with diverse tech backgrounds. What matters most is your eagerness to learn and work with our stack upon joining.
Microservices & Architecture Design: You have experience with microservice architecture and strong knowledge of software architecture design patterns, including Event Driven Architecture.
Additional Tech Experience: Experience with React, MongoDB, Flutter, and Salesforce is a bonus, though not required.
Collaborative and Open to Feedback: You thrive in collaborative environments, actively contribute to team discussions, and are open to both giving and receiving feedback. You're a positive force for change within your team and beyond.
Strong Communication Skills: You communicate ideas clearly and concisely in both written and spoken English. Knowledge of German is an advantage.
Passion for Energy Transition: You are inspired by the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. As one of the largest players in the solar industry, we are committed to making a positive impact—and we want you to join us in this mission.
Agile and Lean Mindset: You embody agile and lean values, prioritizing people over processes, and code over documentation. You focus on reducing waste by building minimum viable products (MVPs), testing them with real users, and evolving solutions as requirements grow.

About SPARETECH

Sparetech's vision is to empower the zero-waste industrial sharing economy by enabling factory operators like BOSCH, PORSCHE, and AIRBUS to no longer store spare parts in their inventories, but rather receive parts when needed. To achieve this vision, we at Sparetech are building a data-driven platform that connects factory operators and suppliers across industries worldwide. Our platform aggregates product data from different partners and thousands of sources, allowing clients to search for the right part and enrich their data with it. Sparetech has successfully closed a €10 million Series A round led by Insight Partners to accelerate our growth. We take pride in its inclusive and collaborative culture, as well as its energetic and committed team, as reflected in the 4.9 stars Kununu ratings.

At SPARETECH, we believe in equal opportunities for every human. No matter where you are from, what you think, what you believe in, what gender you are, or who you love.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Out humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Ads Analytics At Wolt

As the name Ads Analytics implies, this team aims to provide reliable data insights that drive informed decision-making, empower Wolt's product organisation, and foster a data-driven culture through collaboration and education.

About The Ads Domain

The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer visibility and increased performance. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect Marketing or AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Stockholm and Tallinn, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
5+ years of experience in a Data Analyst or Data Scientist position.
Experience with the Ads domain - as a huge plus.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing (A/B testing), experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.


Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Merchant Group At Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.
Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partners - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com) and Jaksa Marojevic (jaksa.marojevic@external.wolt.com)

Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Det är meriterande om du har erfarenhet av naturvetenskapligt samlingsarbete samt kunskap i taxonomi.

Du tar självständigt ansvar för dina arbetsuppgifter, tar initiativ och kommer med förslag på lösningar. Du är noggrann, följer upp det egna arbetet och avslutar det. Du har även god samarbetsförmåga.

Övrig information

Vårt mål är att genom forskning och publik verksamhet visa vägen till ökad kunskap och handlingskraft, för att vi tillsammans ska kunna bidra till en hållbar och ljus framtid. Vår långsiktiga strävan är att Naturhistoriska riksmuseets anställda ska spegla den mångfald som finns i Sverige. Vi välkomnar alla sökanden oavsett kön, bakgrund, ursprung och funktionsvariation.

Inför rekryteringsarbetet har vi tagit ställning till rekryteringskanaler och marknadsföring. Vi undanbeder oss därför kontakt med mediesäljare, rekryteringssajter och liknande.

Vill du vara en del av ett team som arbetar med banbrytande forskning och utveckling inom paleobiologi med fokus på växters anpassning till miljöförändringar över de senaste 200 miljoner åren? Vi söker dig som är engagerad och har en stark teknisk och vetenskaplig nyfikenhet.

I rollen kommer du att:

Arbeta med automatisering av bildanalys med AI för att stödja forskningsprojekt och utveckla nya insikter.

Genomföra analys och modellering av växtfysiologisk data, med fokus på att förstå och lösa komplexa biologiska samband.

Ansvara för mikroskopering av fossila och moderna växter, samt bildanalys och modellering för att främja kunskap om växternas utveckling.

Delta i utvecklingen av enhetens samlings- och bilddatabas, en viktig resurs för samordning och tillgänglighet inom forskningen.

Kvalifikationer

För att lyckas i tjänsten ser vi att du behöver ha:

Erfarenhet av bildanalys med hjälp av deep learning algoritmer som till exempel CNN
Goda kunskaper i databashantering, gärna FileMaker
Mycket goda kunskaper i tal och skrift i svenska och engelska
God kommunikationsförmåga


Det är meriterande om du har erfarenhet av naturvetenskapligt samlingsarbete samt kunskap i taxonomi.

Du tar självständigt ansvar för dina arbetsuppgifter, tar initiativ och kommer med förslag på lösningar. Du är noggrann, följer upp det egna arbetet och avslutar det. Du har även god samarbetsförmåga.

Övrig information

Vårt mål är att genom forskning och publik verksamhet visa vägen till ökad kunskap och handlingskraft, för att vi tillsammans ska kunna bidra till en hållbar och ljus framtid. Vår långsiktiga strävan är att Naturhistoriska riksmuseets anställda ska spegla den mångfald som finns i Sverige. Vi välkomnar alla sökanden oavsett kön, bakgrund, ursprung och funktionsvariation.

Inför rekryteringsarbetet har vi tagit ställning till rekryteringskanaler och marknadsföring. Vi undanbeder oss därför kontakt med mediesäljare, rekryteringssajter och liknande.

We are looking for a motivated Master’s student to explore the potential of modern machine learning approaches in gene function prediction. This project will focus on leveraging protein sequences, language models and sequence embeddings to:

• Predict gene function using convolutional and transformer-based architectures

• Investigate the use of attention mechanisms to improve existing predictors

• Develop novel approaches for predicting protein–protein interactions using embedding space

• Optionally, prototype a variational autoencoder (VAE) to structure protein embedding space




You will work with state-of-the-art embedding models, gain hands-on experience with deep learning (CNNs, transformers, VAEs), and have room to tailor the project toward your interests in functional genomics or protein interaction networks.




Basic experience with Python and ML frameworks (e.g. PyTorch or TensorFlow) is a strong plus. Prior knowledge in bioinformatics is a plus, but not essential.




This opportunity is only given to students currently doing M.Sc. studies at the University of Copenhagen

From system integration to on-site technical support and training sessions you will make a genuine impact in this role!

Join our growing Defence Services organisation in Copenhagen
You will be based at our brand-new office in the heart of Copenhagen, and play a key role in our dynamic and growing team as it works to provide our customers with the best possible support and services.

In this role, you will report directly to the Senior Project Manager for the Nordic constellation, collaborating closely with the Nordic project teams but also with colleagues across our global constellations.

Deliver solutions to support critical decision-making on the battlefield
As a Solution Engineer, you will be a key player in delivering our SitaWare and Iris software products within our customers’ environments. Working closely with colleagues and customers, your tasks will cover a broad range of responsibilities within areas such as solution design, configuration, installation, technical support, technical training, interoperability and testing.

Your key tasks may include:


installing and configuring our software products in customer environments to meet complex user needs
solving technical problems, including fault-finding and troubleshooting
supporting the delivery of technical training for our customers
providing remote and on-site support to customers, especially during military exercises
coordinating with internal and external stakeholders, including customers, subcontractors, consultants and colleagues within Systematic
helping to ensure that projects are delivered within the agreed scope, on budget and on time.



In this role, you will have the opportunity to travel to customer sites and Systematic locations across the Nordics and Europe several times a year.

Bring your strong technical expertise into play
Our new colleague brings with them a strong and broad technical background and experience from a similar role. As a minimum, you hold a bachelor’s degree in software engineering or related field. Ideally, you have experience with and enjoy customer-facing activities as well as providing technical support.

We are also seeking a colleague with skills within one or more of the following:


Windows Enterprise & Server
Linux (Red Hat/Ubuntu)
SQL and MS SQL Server
Network (IP, TCP, UDP, multicast, routing, firewall)
Active Directory, scripting (PowerShell, Bash)
Java enterprise applications and microservices



Finally, you will be one step ahead if you also have experience at working with Docker and Kubernetes.

You must be a strong communicator in both English and Danish. A military background from an IT-related role is a plus but not a requirement.

Please note that you must be able to present a clean criminal record and have lived in a NATO/EU country for the past seven years as we work with security-classified projects. Read more here.

Never stop developing
Systematic is truly international, proudly Danish and uniquely people-centric. Together, we write intelligent and innovative code to drive progress and improve lives. We develop IT solutions that make a real difference where it matters most. This is why we never stop developing. Here, there is room to be professional and personal. Systematic is not just a place to work but a place to belong.

You can look forward to joining our Employees Club, which organises almost 100 social/professional events a year – plenty to choose from. Our colleagues also highlight our canteen, which serves a variety of delicious and healthy dishes each day. In addition, we offer several employee benefits such as paid Home Internet, health insurance and a company pension scheme.

Start your development here

We are currently working with an innovative startup company who are building an autonomous AI platform to help businesses with their hiring needs. Backed by top investors and scaling rapidly, they’re revolutionizing recruitment for essential industries across Europe.




Having just gone through a new funding round, they're looking to add another two engineers to the team.




About the Role:




They’re looking for a passionate full stack developer to join their core team and work closely with the CTO. This is a unique chance to improve and shape the future of their platform and take ownership of impactful, cutting-edge solutions.

Most of your time will be spent working on backend / architecture but their engineers work on features end to end, so some frontend work will be involved too.

What They’re Looking For:




Strong passion for building impactful products
Minimum 4 years’ experience
A growth mindset and interest in AI
Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.




What You’ll Get:




Significant responsibility and ownership
The opportunity to work with AI at the forefront of recruitment
Equity in a fast-growing startup




On offer is up to 65,000 DKK plus benefits!

We're building tools that boost ROI on solar and wind assets across Europe, while making both the investments and the energy produced accessible for any type of consumer, big or small. We’ve already launched for several paying customers just a few short months in, and are part of the first real citizen driven energy community in Denmark. Right now we're 4 people with big dreams and a passion for building stellar products that improve society, and we’d love to expand our team with someone who wants to help us realize those dreams.




The Role We’re looking for a talented Backend Engineer who's both curious and adaptable, and who wants to be part of the early culture of a growing startup. Early employee = real impact + actual ownership. No corporate ladder climbing here, just direct influence on what we build.




Level Junior to Senior




What We Offer

45.000 - 75.000 DKK monthly (adjusted for qualifications and geographic location).
Equity that might actually be worth something someday.
Remote from anywhere in Europe; or hybrid with our office in Copenhagen.
Budget for a home office setup.
1 week extra vacation, on top of location-dependent norm.
Free lunch (because nobody likes sad desk sandwiches).




Our Culture

Honesty (even when it's awkward)
Kindness (even on Mondays)
Enjoying what we do.
Business-focused problem solving.
Working alone when it makes sense, together when it doesn't.




Responsibilities

Write code in our C# backend (and possibly C# frontend).
Help decide what features to build next.
Keep our cloud from raining on us.
Turn business ideas into great products and software.
Wear multiple hats (actual hat-wearing optional).
Be an opinionated part of fostering our work culture.




Qualifications

Someone who knows code but isn't a jerk about it.
C# experience is nice, but not strictly necessary.
Industry experience is nice, but not necessary.
Comfort with ""I don't know yet"" situations.
Solid problem-solving and communication skills.




Join Us! Help us make renewable energy more profitable while getting in early enough for your equity to matter. We're really excited to add to our little team. If you're ready to help revolutionize renewable energy investments while growing with an early-stage startup, we'd love to hear from you!

We are building the leading B2B electricity supplier in Europe. We are building an exceptional team and are on a trajectory to drive impact at scale.
Reel is rethinking electricity procurement to accelerate the renewable energy transition and reduce emissions.
As a workplace, we highly value trust, autonomy, and time for focused deep work.
You have a high passion for renewable energy and want to put your skills to use in a highly purpose-driven, supportive and collaborative organization.
For more info on Reel, see our careers page.




How You Can Contribute

The Impact You Will Make

As our new Software Engineer, you will be directly helping companies achieve lower electricity costs and drive real climate impact. You will work closely with Christian, our CTO, and the rest of the tech team to build the digital infrastructure of the renewable energy transition.




What You Will Work On

These are some (not all) of the things you will be working on

Build software for controlling grid-scale batteries to help stabilize the grid in real-time.
Develop features for our user-facing analytics tools to provide insights into consumption, production, emission and financial data.
Build secure integrations with physical (solar, wind and battery) assets.
Build out best-in-class data pipelines handling vast amounts of data.
Expand our electricity billing engine, ensuring accurate and on-time billing for our customers.
Take part in making key technical decisions.
Perform code reviews, sharing constructive feedback with your colleagues.




How You Can Thrive In This Role

You are enthusiastic about having a real impact on climate change. With a keen interest in renewable energy and sustainability, you are motivated to use your skills to contribute to a cleaner, greener future. You do not need to have prior knowledge about renewables, PPAs, or electricity.




In addition, you will have some (not necessarily all) of the following traits:

Enjoy working on projects all the way from 0 to 1, shipping multiple times a week.
Like to work across the entire tech stack, but with a focus on back-end and data.
Have 2+ years of professional experience working with software engineering.
Value learning and growing your skillset with support from your team.
You thrive working in an environment with a high degree of autonomy and responsibility, but are also not afraid to reach out and ask for help.
We work in Elixir, using the Phoenix framework and LiveView for the front-end + Python for ML and trading. We’re hosted on Fly.io and GCP, data in Postgres and BigQuery. Experience in this stack is by no means a requirement - several engineers on the team today had no prior experience in Elixir.




What We Offer You

We aim to provide you with a workplace environment where you can grow both professionally and personally. We offer an attractive base salary as well as a generous warrant program for all full-time employees.




Benefits

Vacation: Enjoy 30 days (5 weeks + 1) of paid holidays to recharge.
Pension: Benefit from an attractive employer-supported pension scheme, including health insurance.
Parental leave: Take advantage of our generous parental leave policy.
Equipment: Choose your preferred IT setup (Mac, Windows, etc.) with a budget of 25,000 DKK.
Learning: Grow your skills with an annual 4,000 DKK learning and development budget.
Office: Experience our vibrant office-first culture in our beautiful waterside location in Christianshavn, with a flexible work-from-home or remote work policy.
Lunch: Enjoy employer-supported catered lunch at the office every day.
Socials: Join us for monthly social events and bi-annual offsites, fostering a strong team spirit.
Visa: We support non-EU residents by sponsoring VISAs.

Har du evnen og interessen for at prøve kræfter med udvikling af komplekse Azure cloud-løsninger? cVation søger erfarne software udviklere til at indgå i vores voksende team, hvor høj faglighed, innovation og udviklerglæde er i højsæde.




cVation er et dansk udviklings- og konsulenthus, som bygger avancerede cloud-løsninger på Azure med afsæt i markedets hurtigste og mest agile metoder. cVation blev stiftet i 2014, har modtaget tre Børsen Gazeller og vundet Microsofts Partner Award for App Innovation tre år i træk. Vi arbejder dedikeret med agile arbejdsmetoder, DevOps og Test Driven Development, og er på forkant med mange af de nye teknologier, herunder IoT. Vi sætter desuden en ære i at levere software af den højeste kvalitet.

Hvilken rolle får du?




Du vil blive en del af et team, der designer og udvikler avancerede cloud-løsninger på MS Azure. Din rolle bliver bl.a. at rådgive om valg af Azure services, implementere og vedligeholde værktøjer, der sikrer continuous integration og continuous delivery og understøtter applikationsudviklingen. Vi har en meget høj release-frekvens i vores projekter, da brugen af vores egenudviklede tool CADD resulterer i ekstremt agile IT-projekter.




Udviklerne i cVation er samlet i teams på 5-8 udviklere. Du vil have fuldt fokus på et projekt/team af gangen. Ud over de hyppige releases til produktion har vi en ekstrem høj grad af automatisering af alt fra unit tests til integrationstests og UI-tests. Det betyder, at de repetitive processer er fjernet, så der er luft til at tænke innovativt, hvilket kommer vores kunder til gode. Kort sagt får de hurtigere udviklede løsninger af højere kvalitet og med en større forretningsmæssig værdi – og du får mulighed for faglig fordybelse og udvikle dig indenfor de nyeste teknologier.




Vi har også etableret et CCoE (Cloud Center of Excellence), som løbende vurderer nye cloud services og opdaterer værktøjskassen med relevante opdateringer. CCoE arbejder tæt sammen med de enkelte udviklingsteams, som har fingeren på pulsen ude på kundeprojekterne.

Hvad forventer vi af dig?




Erfaring med cloud udvikling og særligt PaaS services fra MS Azure, vil være en klar fordel.

Kandidat i softwareudvikling
Du er erfaren i C#, og at du går op i kodekvalitet og at skrive testbar kode
Du vil gerne arbejde med de nyeste teknologier i Azure med hovedfokus på PaaS
Du har erfaring med at arbejde med automatisering af byg og test af applikationer
Du har erfaring med softwareudvikling og gerne webudvikling
Du vil gerne indgå i et agilt setup, hvor krav og retning hurtigt kan ændres, men hvor medbestemmelse og frihed er i højsædet
Du har arbejdet med automatisering af test, build og release pipelines samt Infrastructure as code
Du er vant til at arbejde med versionskontrol, gerne Git
Du taler/skriver flydende dansk, og taler/skriver engelsk på et medium/højt niveau.

Som person er du ansvarsbevidst, initiativrig, eksekverende og resultatorienteret. Du gør dig umage med dine opgaver og trives med at løfte i flok som del af et team. Hvis du også er engageret, nysgerrig, drevet af at lære nyt og sætter en ære i at dygtiggøre dig passer du perfekt ind hos os. Du må også gerne gå op i at forbedre både kode, værktøjer samt processer.

Hvad tilbyder vi?




Du kommer til at indgå i vores voksende team, hvor høj faglighed, innovation og arbejdsglæde er i højsæde. Det høje faglige niveau blandt dine kollegaer giver en unik mulighed for at arbejde med de bedste, og vi tager din faglige udvikling alvorligt. Vi har en flad organisation med et minimum af administration, hvor ledelsens døre altid er åbne, og der er god plads til både bordfodbold, fredagsbar, frokost på kajen og et aktivt liv udenfor arbejdstid. Flere gange om året afholder vi hackathons, hvor vi i teams dykker ned i præcis de emner, som udviklerne finder interessante. En del af vores kultur er også, at vi gerne ser alle komme med input til hvordan vi kan optimere, forbedre og udvikle cVation.

Hvorfor vælge os som din nye arbejdsplads?




Vores fundament er løsninger bygget på Microsoft Azure Cloud. Alle vores medarbejdere mestrer cloud-native udvikling og DevOps. Vi arbejder i projekter og engagerer os hands-on i fælles teams med vores kunder for at sikre kvalitet og effektiv videndeling.




Vi er passionerede omkring at hjælpe vores kunder med at få det maksimale ud af cloudteknologien. For os er cloud ikke blot infrastruktur eller et nyt datacenter i skyen. Teknologien giver virksomheder mulighed for at skabe væsentligt mere værdi og arbejde med agilitet og innovation på en helt ny måde.




Vi har været med fra starten, da cloud blev udviklet og tilgængeligt. Vi tilbyder således vores årelange erfaring og dybe cloud ekspertise samt en værktøjskasse med alle vores best practices i form af accelerationsplatformen CADD. Den dækker over gennemprøvede værktøjer, rammeværk, effektive udviklingsmetoder og færdige automatiseringskomponenter. Alt dette for at sikre, at projekter kommer hurtigt og sikkert fra start.




Du vil få kollegaer, der er interesseret i at lære og har ønske om at blive de bedste til det, de gør. Vi tilbyder derfor gode muligheder for at udvikle dig. Du vil blive en del af en virksomhed, som tror på, at alle har betydning, og at det skal være sjovt at gå på arbejde hver dag.

Interesseret?




Klik på Easy Apply knappen, hvis du vil arbejde med de nyeste teknologier. Vi behandler din ansøgning fortroligt og arrangerer løbende interviews.




Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, eller vil du høre mere om cVation, er du meget velkommen til at kontakte:

Vi ser frem til at høre fra dig!

Som softwareudvikler i Native Tech-teamet kommer du helt tæt på udviklingen af Bankdatas mobil- og netbank – med ansvar for centrale komponenter som login og signering. Her arbejder du med en kompleks hybrid-løsning, hvor kvalitet, samarbejde og de nyeste teknologier går hånd i hånd.

Din mission: Byg sikker og moderne mobilbank

Bankdatas mobil- og netbank er blandt de mest brugte finansielle apps i Danmark – og det stiller høje krav til både sikkerhed, stabilitet og brugervenlighed. I rollen som softwareudvikler bliver du medansvarlig for at videreudvikle de komponenter, der binder hele løsningen sammen: login, signering og andre kritiske sikkerhedsfunktioner.

Du kommer til at arbejde i grænselandet mellem native mobiludvikling og web, hvor du bygger videre på vores hybride platform. Her har du mulighed for både at dykke teknisk dybt og tænke på tværs – så vi sikrer, at mobilbanken ikke bare fungerer, men opleves gnidningsfri, moderne og tryg at bruge for slutbrugeren.

Teamet består af 5 udvikler og én PO. Vi er et tæt og erfarent team med højt til loftet, masser af sparring og frihed til at eksperimentere med ny teknologi – for vi har ambitioner om at sætte standarden for digital bankoplevelse.

Din rolle: Udvikl kernefunktioner i en af Danmarks mest brugte apps

Som softwareudvikler i Native Tech kommer du til at:


Udvikle og vedligeholde centrale komponenter i mobil- og netbanken – fx login og signering
Arbejde i krydsfeltet mellem native og web – med Angular, Capacitor, Android og iOS
Bidrage aktivt til teamets DevOps-setup og vores teknologiske retning
Tage ansvar for løsninger med høj kvalitet og sikkerhed
Være med til at sætte retning og udvikle teamets arbejdsformer



Din profil – Faglighed, nysgerrighed og lyst til at lære

Vi forestiller os, at du har en baggrund som datalog eller ingeniør – og vigtigst: at du er nysgerrig, lærevillig og teamorienteret.

Du har:


Erfaring med Android og/eller iOS udvikling – eller lyst til at dykke ned i det
Erfaring med Angular eller andet SPA-framework
Interesse for DevOps og at arbejde med drift og udvikling i samme team
Et øje for kvalitet og evnen til at tænke i helheder
Lyst til at tage ansvar og bidrage aktivt til teamet



Hvad tilbyder vi?

Shape the Future of Vision Technology

Your specific responsibilities will depend on your background and experience, and may include:

Development of industrial computer vision solutions, such as automated quality control, inspection, or vision-guided robot control.
End-to-end process development: solution design, selection of lighting and camera technology, building test setups, designing and developing both rule-based and AI-based vision algorithms, software development, and implementation at the client’s site.
Training and optimizing AI models for image processing, with a focus on high performance and robustness.
Participating in national and international research and development projects, and staying up to date with new technologies and methods.




We Are Looking for Someone Who:

Can translate their knowledge of computer vision and image processing into practical solutions—from image acquisition and processing to implementation in industrial systems.
Has experience with algorithm development, both rule-based machine vision methods and AI/deep learning for image analysis.
Possesses a strong technical background—perhaps with a master’s or PhD in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or similar—and is eager to use their knowledge to create real-world results together with the team.

As many of our customers are Danish, we expect you to be open to learning Danish. We will provide the language lessons as part of the job.




Join Danish Technological Institute

You will be part of the Robotics and Automation Centre, where dedicated colleagues with broad and deep expertise develop and implement new technologies in both existing and new products, particularly for the manufacturing and production industry. We are one of Europe’s leading robotics innovators and a respected, in-demand research partner in national and international R&D projects. See examples of our work here.




Are You Our New Colleague?

We offer plenty of room for growth, both personally and professionally, and a chance to get hands-on experience working with some of the latest technologies to generate real-life value for many end-users throughout the organization. You get the chance to take ownership of your tasks and help drive our projects forward.

Your responsibilities will include:


Developing features and fix bugs in our backend. Our tech stack comprises Java 8 or higher, Spring Boot, REST and SQL
Working with Github, Kubernetes, Docker and CI/CD tools
Maintaining and improving the quality of our codebase through the implementation of software development best practices.
Bringing new perspectives and ideas on how to streamline and improve our codebase and workflow.


If you are curious and interested in learning about the rest of our stack, it’s definitely a plus - but not a requirement.

You will be based in Aarhus with the option to work from home. The estimated workload is 10-16 hours weekly and you’ll have the flexibility to plan your own time.

Your Benefits

We believe in growing stronger together. By joining us, you'll have the opportunity to enhance your skills, gain valuable experience in tech, create software that makes a difference for the users, and explore your own abilities and interests while doing so. We foster a supportive culture where everyone helps each other, so if you need assistance, it's always available. You'll have a lot of responsibility and opportunities to learn and grow.

YOUR PROFILE

Your primary role will be to turn features into code and fix bugs as they arise. We are looking for someone who takes great pride in software development as a craft, aspires to write code that is easy to work with, and is informed by best practices while recognizing that nothing is ever black and white. You'll have the opportunity to put your theoretical knowledge about professional software development into practice and apply it to exciting and demanding challenges that allow you to grow and make a real difference for our end users throughout the organization.

We are looking for a proactive and curious student worker to become part of our back-end team: If you're someone who isn't afraid to challenge existing processes and question the status quo, you'll fit right in!

We are especially looking for someone who:


Are enrolled in a relevant field of study, such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, IT-product Development or similar.
Have experience with or a desire to learn Java 8 or higher, Spring Boot, REST and SQL.
Are proactive, curious, and eager to learn and grow, and take pride in developing resilient, stable, and well-written software that is highly maintainable and a joy to work with.
Are a team player and not afraid to ask questions.
Fluency in English, both spoken and written.

We’re delighted to be working with one of Europe’s most exciting tech startups, as they continue their mission to become the leader in their market.




They’re now on the lookout for a Senior Platform Engineer to join their Infrastructure team and help take developer experience to the next level.




The Role




In this role, you'll be at the core of platform engineering—designing and maintaining the backbone that enables rapid innovation across all product teams.




You’ll be the kind of person who thrives on crafting elegant, scalable solutions to improve the developer journey—building pipelines devs love, refining observability systems, and baking reliability and security into everything from day one.




You’ll be managing infrastructure at scale, driving platform maturity, and ensuring engineering teams are empowered to build exceptional products—fast and safely.




What You’ll Bring




A ""platform-as-a-product"" mindset—prioritizing what truly moves the needle for developers.
5+ years of experience in software engineering in high-growth environments.
Deep knowledge of cloud infrastructure, especially AWS.
Strong experience with IaC tools—Terraform or OpenTofu ideally.
A background within software engineering, to ensure empathy with the devs you’ll work closely with
A passion for security and embedding compliance early in the lifecycle.




The Company




With a current team of over 400 and huge growth planned in the next few years, this is an opportunity to get in while the rocket ship’s still near the launchpad.




Their tech is used by tens of thousands of teams across the globe every week—helping analysts record, analyse, and improve performance with ease.




The company’s mission is a positive and inclusive one: to ensure access to performance tools, regardless of background, budget, or location.




Their Copenhagen HQ is the coolest office I’ve ever visited, so I’m sure you’ll agree. Most of their team are onsite between 3-5 days a week. They offer flexibility on remote working, but their staff like being in the office more often than not.

Portchain was founded to make maritime shipping more predictable, efficient, and green, which currently transports 90% of global traded goods. By enabling more efficient operations and streamlining communication between terminals and shipping lines, Portchain is helping to optimise vessel speed, reduce idle time and ultimately lower fuel consumption. Today Portchain coordinates 5% of global shipping traffic, with projections to reach 10% by year-end and an ambitious 25% the following year. The environmental impact is significant, with fuel savings achieved through Portchain's platform equating to removing 100,000 cars from the roads from just the last 12 months.




The role

We are currently using Node.js (TypeScript) and PostgreSQL running on Google Cloud and using Github and Terraform for CI/CD.




We believe in release early, release often, which is why we run several daily releases using our continuous integration and deployment setup.




Developers work on projects in small teams of 2-3 people each. We focus on minimal overhead and bureaucracy as we want to ensure independence and that decision power stays within the teams. This means that teams have a lot of influence on how they work, what they focus on, and how they deliver new features and functionality.




A typical day as a Portchain software engineer will start with a team check-in to ensure nobody is blocked or needs help. Then maybe catch up with the PM about any questions before determining how to solve this. Maybe a quick chat with the Designer to see if your solution will match the need or if it is a data task, then catching-up with one of the analytics people to double check the data flow makes sense.




You’ll be responsible for moving your own code into production and monitoring it afterwards with our metrics and logging setup (built around Datadog).

You will work in our Copenhagen office with the option of working remotely 1-2 days a week.




What we're looking for

We don’t expect you to tick every box in our current tech stack. What matters is that you have experience as a developer, you like to learn, and know how to leverage your experience across technology stacks and languages.




But here's what would be a good fit:

Experience in more than one technology stack
RESTful/GraphQL APIs in Node.js, Go or similar
PostgreSQL, MySQL or similar
JavaScript, TypeScript or similar
Dependency management tools like Yarn or npm
Continuous integration, TDD or similar
Google Cloud, AWS, Azure or similar
Focus on quality and doing things right

You get extra points, if you:

Code in your spare time
Have GitHub or a similar account with sample code
Have Open Source development experience




What's in it for you?

Competitive salary and pension scheme
Flexible working hours
Awesome lunch from Meyers
Snacks and drinks
Amazing Colleagues: Collaborate with a team of passionate and talented individuals.
Development Budget: We support your career and skill development with a dedicated budget and time for learning and improvement.

I stillingen, der har CPH-titlen Senior Data Scientist, er en af dine hovedopgaver at arbejde med passagerprognoser, der et af de mest afgørende datapunkter for at sikre optimal planlægning og drift af lufthavnen. Så det håber vi, du synes lyder bare halvt så spændende, som vi ved, det kan være.

Om at være Senior Data Scientist

Hos os arbejder du med data, der har en direkte indflydelse på kundeoplevelsen i CPH. Dit arbejde sætter tydelige spor i alle afkroge af organisationen – særligt de operationelle –, hvor passager forecast er en af nøglerne til en 1. klasses driftsoplevelse hos både rejsende og dine nye CPH-kollegaer. Du har et tæt samarbejde med Security, hvor du skal fremlægge analyser for performance, og hvad vi forventer af fremtiden.

Vi ser frem til, at du bidrager med at:


Udvikle og implementere passagerprognoser til både taktisk og operationel planlægning.
Udvikle og automatisere fremmødeprognoser ved Security for optimal driftsstyring.
Analysere driftsperformance og udarbejde sporbehov i Security op til 7 måneder frem.
Levere analyser, der sikrer, at lufthavnens infrastruktur og drift skalerer effektivt med trafikudviklingen.


Udover dit nye team kan du se frem til samarbejde på tværs af afdelingerne, som nyder godt af dit arbejde. Du har bl.a. fornøjelsen af Security, Digital, Airside Operations, Bagage og andre dygtige CPH-kollegaer.

Om hvordan du lykkes i jobbet

I din nye rolle trives du med, at dine analyser hurtigt omsættes til konkrete beslutninger og handlinger i forretningen. Du er en central drivkraft i arbejdet med passagerprognoser og ressourcebehov, hvor dine indsigter har direkte indflydelse på både den daglige drift og de strategiske beslutninger, der former lufthavnens fremtid.

Du er det rette match, hvis du er resultatorienteret, fokuseret på at få opgaverne gennemført og skabe resultater, der understøtter forretningens behov. Med din analytiske sans trives du med at dykke ned i komplekse datasæt og omsætte dem til klare, datadrevne indsigter. Derudover er du nysgerrig og læringsorienteret, og du bringer nye metoder og teknologier i spil for at hæve kvaliteten af analyser og løsninger.

Vi håber, at din faglige bagage indeholder:


Relevant uddannelsesbaggrund inden for f.eks. matematik, økonomi eller datalogi – gerne på kandidatniveau.
Solid erfaring med Machine Learning og statistisk modellering i praksis.
Skarphed i både Python og SQL og bruger dem som naturlige værktøjer i dit arbejde.
Mindst 4 års erfaring fra en lignende stilling med ansvar for avancerede analyser og modeller.


Om afdelingen

Vi er et team med forskellige faglige baggrunde, men med en fælles passion for data. Vores forskellige kompetencer supplerer hinanden og gør samarbejdet både stærkt og inspirerende – vi bruger netop vores forskelligheder til at skabe indsigt og værdi.

I teamet finder du blandt andet en tidligere professionel basketballspiller, en nybagt far, én der har kastet sig over hækling, og én der måske elsker Python mere end livet selv.

Vi er tre kollegaer og en leder, der glæder os til at byde dig velkommen og lære dig at kende – både fagligt og socialt.

Om Ali, din nye leder

Som leder prioriterer jeg frihed i opgaveløsningen, da jeg mener, at høj faglighed og frihed i opgaveløsningen komplementerer hinanden og skaber de bedste resultater. Med det sagt står jeg selvfølgelig altid til rådighed med sparring eller råd om en opgave – og det gør teamet også.

Jeg går meget op i personlig og faglig vækst, hvor der er plads til at prøve nye tilgange og lære undervejs. Det er derfor også vigtigt for mig, at vi har fokustid hver dag til fordybelse, samt at vi hver 3. uge bruger 1 time til læring og/eller optimering af eksisterende leverancer.

Om os | Hvad tilbyder vi

Du bliver en del af en helt særlig atmosfære og en organisation, der hver dag arbejder engageret for, at vores passagerer får den bedste rejseoplevelse.

Udover frokostbuffet, pension og IT-udstyr tilbyder vi:


Frihed til planlægning af dine opgaver – det betyder for eksempel, at du har mulighed for at arbejde hjemmefra efter aftale med din leder
Fri parkering, cykelservice (i arbejdstiden), bilrengøring og gode rabataftaler
Fysioterapi og træningslokale, yoga, rådgivning fra træner mv.
Sundhedssikring – børn er dækket automatisk
Individuelle udviklingssamtaler.


Om ansøgningen | Stig ombord på dit nye job

Vi ser frem til at læse din ansøgning, så send den gerne snarest muligt og senest den 20. maj.

Vi modtager kun ansøgninger via vores rekrutteringssystem og ikke pr. mail.

Har du spørgsmål til jobbet inden da, kan du kontakte Ali Agha Javed, Senior Manager Analytics på ali.agha.javed@cph.dk eller 53 65 03 26.

Det er en forudsætning for ansættelse, at du kan blive politigodkendt, ligesom du skal kunne opretholde politigodkendelsen gennem hele din ansættelse.

Derudover er det en forudsætning for at arbejde i Københavns Lufthavne, at du begår dig komfortabelt på dansk- både skriftligt og mundtligt.

Har du lyst til at udforske nye idéer? Og vil du være med til at teste nye og spændende

AI-løsninger?

Sammen skaber vi fremtidens løsninger

Du bliver en del af vores nyetablerede AI Accelerator-team, som er forankret i Tech og Innovation og har base i Fredericia. Vi arbejder agilt og tværgående for at levere tekniske løsninger, der understøtter forretningen under temaet ”AI for Alle”, og vores mål er at fremskynde værdiskabende brug af AI på tværs af Energinet.

Vi eksperimenterer og udvikler løsninger med standard- og low-code-værktøjer som Agent, Copilot Studio og Open AI. Samtidig har vi fokus på compliance og udvikling af AI-kompetencer i hele Energinet i tæt samarbejde med resten af Energinets AI-netværk.

Vær med til at udvikle og teste nye AI-løsninger

Som AI konsulent i et agilt team er din kerneopgave at udvikle AI-løsninger – i starten primært i Copilot Studio.

”Vi får use cases ind fra forretningen. Nogle gange er det løsninger, som vi skal hjælpe med at videreudvikle. Andre gange tager vi det helt fra scratch. Så selvom vi sidder med det tekniske, har vi også meget direkte kontakt med forretningen,” forklarer din nye kollega, Frederik Bruun, AI konsulent.

Som Frederik beskriver det, så er opgaverne mangeartede. Konkret vil dine opgaver bl.a. være:


Indgå i løbende dialog med kunderne for at forstå deres krav og optimere løsningerne
Udvikle prototyper baseret på kundernes specifikke behov og feedback
Teste AI-løsninger for at sikre funktionalitet og brugervenlighed



Du har en god teknisk forståelse – og er nysgerrig på AI

Vi forventer ikke, at du er hardcore udvikler. Til gengæld har du en teknisk forståelse for AI-løsninger, og ved hvordan man omsætter idéer til prototyper og konkrete løsninger.

Det et stort plus, hvis du har erfaring med Copilot Studio (Power platform), som bliver dit primære arbejdsværktøj. Derudover arbejder vi også i andre Microsoft AI værktøjer (Copilot, Agenter, AI Foundry) - og vi forventer, at du har kendskab til dem eller tilsvarende/sammen-

lignelige systemer samt forståelse for prompt engineering, API-kald o.l.

Derudover er det vigtigste, at du har teknisk erfaring og kan arbejde struktureret med innovation og udvikling. Du må gerne være lidt visionær og samtidig kunne argumentere for, hvorfor vi skal gå videre med bestemte idéer frem for andre. Endelig er du nysgerrig og initiativrig, og du har lyst til at samarbejde med mange forskellige typer af kolleger på tværs af Energinet.

Særlige forhold: Jobbet kræver, at du kan opnå og opretholde sikkerhedsgodkendelse.

På PET's hjemmeside kan du læse mere om sikkerhedsgodkendelse . I enkeltstående situationer kan det være nødvendigt at foretage et baggrundstjek forud for sikkerheds-

godkendelsen.

Vil du være med til at gøre en forskel sammen med os?

Så ser vi frem til at modtage din motiverede ansøgning og CV senest den 18. maj. Sæt allerede nu et par forsigtige kryds i kalenderen 20. maj, hvor vi holder 1. samtale online, og 26. maj, hvor vi holder 2. samtale i Fredericia.

Er du nysgerrig på din kommende leder, eller har du spørgsmål til jobbet? Se nærmere på LinkedIn eller ring til Agile People Leader, Marie Søndergaard på tlf. 2180 2686.

Vi ser mangfoldighed som en styrke og opfordrer alle kvalificerede, uanset baggrund, til at søge jobbet. Vi arbejder aktivt og målrettet med mangfoldighed i Energinet og opfordrer dig derfor til at udelade billede, oplysninger om alder, civilstand og lignende, for at minimere ubevidste biases i processen. Du kan læse mere om vores mangfoldighedspolitik her.

Du bliver en del af Tech & Innovation, der understøtter hele Energinet inden for innovation, digitalisering, IT-udvikling og -drift. Som strategisk partner arbejder vi på tværs af hele Energinet for at levere innovation og teknologiske løsninger, der støtter Energinets kerneopgave med at forsyne samfundet med el og gas. Tech og Innovation er organiseret efter agile principper, hvor teams samarbejder effektivt for at skabe de mest effektive løsninger for Energinet.

Glæd dig til at blive en del af en organisation med et meningsfuldt formål, hvor vi forsyner Danmark med el og gas, og omstiller energisystemet til grøn energi.

I en god balance mellem dine ønsker og værdien for Energinet får du stor indflydelse på hvor og hvornår du løser dine arbejdsopgaver. Læs mere om vores fleksible medarbejderfordele , der også inkluderer en aktiv personaleforening, en attraktiv forældrepakke, hjemmearbejdsplads og -udstyr, seniorordning mv.

I stillingen, der har CPH-titlen Senior Data Scientist, er en af dine hovedopgaver at arbejde med passagerprognoser, der et af de mest afgørende datapunkter for at sikre optimal planlægning og drift af lufthavnen. Så det håber vi, du synes lyder bare halvt så spændende, som vi ved, det kan være.

Om at være Senior Data Scientist

Hos os arbejder du med data, der har en direkte indflydelse på kundeoplevelsen i CPH. Dit arbejde sætter tydelige spor i alle afkroge af organisationen – særligt de operationelle –, hvor passager forecast er en af nøglerne til en 1. klasses driftsoplevelse hos både rejsende og dine nye CPH-kollegaer. Du har et tæt samarbejde med Security, hvor du skal fremlægge analyser for performance, og hvad vi forventer af fremtiden.

Vi ser frem til, at du bidrager med at:


Udvikle og implementere passagerprognoser til både taktisk og operationel planlægning.
Udvikle og automatisere fremmødeprognoser ved Security for optimal driftsstyring.
Analysere driftsperformance og udarbejde sporbehov i Security op til 7 måneder frem.
Levere analyser, der sikrer, at lufthavnens infrastruktur og drift skalerer effektivt med trafikudviklingen.


Udover dit nye team kan du se frem til samarbejde på tværs af afdelingerne, som nyder godt af dit arbejde. Du har bl.a. fornøjelsen af Security, Digital, Airside Operations, Bagage og andre dygtige CPH-kollegaer.

Om hvordan du lykkes i jobbet

I din nye rolle trives du med, at dine analyser hurtigt omsættes til konkrete beslutninger og handlinger i forretningen. Du er en central drivkraft i arbejdet med passagerprognoser og ressourcebehov, hvor dine indsigter har direkte indflydelse på både den daglige drift og de strategiske beslutninger, der former lufthavnens fremtid.

Du er det rette match, hvis du er resultatorienteret, fokuseret på at få opgaverne gennemført og skabe resultater, der understøtter forretningens behov. Med din analytiske sans trives du med at dykke ned i komplekse datasæt og omsætte dem til klare, datadrevne indsigter. Derudover er du nysgerrig og læringsorienteret, og du bringer nye metoder og teknologier i spil for at hæve kvaliteten af analyser og løsninger.

Vi håber, at din faglige bagage indeholder:


Relevant uddannelsesbaggrund inden for f.eks. matematik, økonomi eller datalogi – gerne på kandidatniveau.
Solid erfaring med Machine Learning og statistisk modellering i praksis.
Skarphed i både Python og SQL og bruger dem som naturlige værktøjer i dit arbejde.
Mindst 4 års erfaring fra en lignende stilling med ansvar for avancerede analyser og modeller.


Om afdelingen

Vi er et team med forskellige faglige baggrunde, men med en fælles passion for data. Vores forskellige kompetencer supplerer hinanden og gør samarbejdet både stærkt og inspirerende – vi bruger netop vores forskelligheder til at skabe indsigt og værdi.

I teamet finder du blandt andet en tidligere professionel basketballspiller, en nybagt far, én der har kastet sig over hækling, og én der måske elsker Python mere end livet selv.

Vi er tre kollegaer og en leder, der glæder os til at byde dig velkommen og lære dig at kende – både fagligt og socialt.

Om Ali, din nye leder

Som leder prioriterer jeg frihed i opgaveløsningen, da jeg mener, at høj faglighed og frihed i opgaveløsningen komplementerer hinanden og skaber de bedste resultater. Med det sagt står jeg selvfølgelig altid til rådighed med sparring eller råd om en opgave – og det gør teamet også.

Jeg går meget op i personlig og faglig vækst, hvor der er plads til at prøve nye tilgange og lære undervejs. Det er derfor også vigtigt for mig, at vi har fokustid hver dag til fordybelse, samt at vi hver 3. uge bruger 1 time til læring og/eller optimering af eksisterende leverancer.

Om os | Hvad tilbyder vi

Du bliver en del af en helt særlig atmosfære og en organisation, der hver dag arbejder engageret for, at vores passagerer får den bedste rejseoplevelse.

Udover frokostbuffet, pension og IT-udstyr tilbyder vi:


Frihed til planlægning af dine opgaver – det betyder for eksempel, at du har mulighed for at arbejde hjemmefra efter aftale med din leder
Fri parkering, cykelservice (i arbejdstiden), bilrengøring og gode rabataftaler
Fysioterapi og træningslokale, yoga, rådgivning fra træner mv.
Sundhedssikring – børn er dækket automatisk
Individuelle udviklingssamtaler.

Vi ser frem til at læse din ansøgning, så send den gerne snarest muligt og senest den 20. maj.

Vi modtager kun ansøgninger via vores rekrutteringssystem og ikke pr. mail.

Create building-level and fleet-level heating and cooling optimisation models
Design new & novel approaches to heat and cool homes at lower energy costs
Work with developers to create & deliver optimisation instructions to Octopus & third-party heat pumps, air conditioners, and associated technologies
Support the rollout of heating/cooling assets into energy flexibility markets



What you'll need:


Experience in a relevant field like energy management, controls design, or machine learning applied to energy or complex optimisation systems
A strong grasp of data science tools and platforms (SQL, Python, etc.)
Solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and experience creating stochastic models
Knowledge of UK and/or European energy markets, particularly energy flexibility
Experience building predictive models using a range of data sources (internal and external)
Familiarity with how heating systems behave and are controlled - especially air-to-water heat pumps and hot water systems
A Master’s degree or PhD in a quantitative field (like Data Science, Computer Science, or Statistics) is great - but equivalent experience is equally valued



Our process usually takes up to 4 weeks, but we’ll always do our best to flex around what works for you. Along the way, you’ll chat with our recruitment team and your Recruiter will help you throughout different stages. Got any burning questions before then?

Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success.

We Need You To

Get close to, and stay close to the clinicians who are seeing patients, and the managers who are helping make improvements in our hospitals.

Help us plan, prioritise, forecast, and simulate our way to better outcomes and experiences for patients.

Identify and diagnose problems, decide how your data skills can be best applied, and then show us what your techniques can do.

Actively help steer our improvement using the insight that you build from working in detail with our data.

Help us share more of our code in public (we work mainly in R and python).

NUH is a large acute trust (you can see our ED at work in recent series of ""24 Hours in A&E""), and we are a data team well-connected to our senior decision-makers. There will never be less data available than there is today, and the rate that large hospitals generate data points is increasing. Our team is busy finding ways to uncover signal in the noise AND make it directly operationally useful to the people who can make and change decisions.

We're a small and friendly team, and we're working on interesting and impactful work. Can you help us?

This is a permanent hybrid role, split between days at home and days in the office in Nottingham.

Our work covers a wide range of subjects, including inpatients, outpatients, theatres, diagnostics, elective work, emergency work, paediatrics, planning, and support for capital projects.

You will be working alongside other data scientists and data analysts to:

Build analysis and information products to help decision-makers understand their day to day reality, and help them plan and prioritise the most impactful next steps.

Build models of our hospital's interactions in code, so that we can simulate and iterate our way through options together quickly and cheaply.

Contribute to the modelling we do to support our annual planning process, which aims to achieve a 3-way balance between patient activity, budget, and available workforce.

Build tools and infrastructure to help us make our data work faster, more efficient, and more repeatable.

As a Band 7 Data Scientist You Will Probably

Prefer to work in either R or python (we use both, as needed), and be familiar with collaborating with other team members using git.

Have practical experience of applying things like machine learning, statistics, data wrangling, and dashboarding to real-world problems.

Be familiar with communicating technical results to non-technical audiences, including making recommendations where supported with data.

With over 19,000 staff, we are one of the biggest employers in the city with a central role in supporting the health and wellbeing of our local population. We play a leading role in research, education and innovation.

Come and join our wonderful team at NUH. We are big believers in diversity and welcome new ideas to help develop our team in order to deliver world class healthcare to the vast patient populations we serve. With endless personal development opportunities available, at NUH we will endeavour to turn your job into a career!

We particularly welcome applications from people who identify as Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic, or Disabled, as we are striving to be better represented at NUH.

The Roku Culture


Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 




We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.




Who we're looking for

We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to play a key role in our Core Pricing team. You will drive innovation by optimising and automating Pricing processes to enable faster, more accurate decision-making. Your work will focus on developing and maintaining tooling and frameworks that enhance the efficiency of our predictive models, reducing deployment times, increasing scalability, and improving model performance through regular updates and monitoring. You will work closely with our Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product team to deliver scalable, production-grade ML systems.




Key Responsibilities

Build model lifecycle tooling (deployment, monitoring and alerting) for our predictive models (for example claims cost, conversion, retention, market models)
Maintain and improve the development environment (Kubeflow) used by our Data Scientists and Actuaries
Develop and maintain pricing analytics tools that enable faster impact assessments, reducing manual work
Collaborate with the technical pricing, street pricing and product teams to gather requirements and feedback on tooling and to build impactful technology
Communicate complex concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders through clear storytelling




Required Skills

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science or related field
Experience: Proven experience in ML model lifecycle management
Core Competencies:
Model lifecycle: You’ve got hands-on experience with managing the ML model lifecycle, including both online and batch processes
Statistical Methodology: You have worked with GLMs and other machine learning algorithms and have in-depth knowledge of how they work
Python: You have built and deployed production-grade Python applications and you are familiar with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
Tooling & Environment:
DevOps: You have experience working with DevOps tooling, such as gitops, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools (we use buildkite) and Docker
Cloud: You have worked with cloud-based environments before (we use AWS)
SQL: You have a good grasp of SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Version control: You are proficient with git
Soft Skills:
You are an excellent communicator, with an ability to translate non-technical requirements into clear, actionable pieces of work
You have proven your project management skills, with the ability to manage multiple priorities
You have worked closely together in cross-functional teams, including with Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product Managers




Nice To Have

Experience in UK motor insurance
Telematics Data: Familiarity with behavioural driving data and its application in insurance pricing
Understanding of pricing modelling tools such as Akur8 or Emblem
Experience with IaC (we use Terraform)
Experience with gRPC/protobuf

Location: London

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Data Scientist with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

Data infuses everything Ripjar does. We work with a wide variety of datasets of all scales, including an always-growing archive of 10 billion news articles in (nearly!) every language in the world going back over 30 years, sanctions and watchlist data provided by governments, plus 250 million organisations and ownership data from global corporate registries.

We have 2 core product offerings, Labyrinth Screening & Labyrinth Intelligence. Labyrinth Screening allows companies to monitor their customers or suppliers for entities that they aren't allowed to or do not want to do business with (for ethical or environmental reasons). Labyrinth Intelligence empowers organisation to perform deep investigations into varied datasets to find interesting patterns and relationships.

This is a great time to join a growing group of highly talented technologists and data scientists who are building products that solve real world issues and are changing the way criminal activities are detected and prevented.

What You'll Be Doing

We're looking for an experienced, highly motivated Data Scientist to support the research, development, and ongoing maintenance of Ripjar's analytics and data products. You will carry out data analysis tasks to develop Ripjar's understanding of relevant data and will develop, evaluate and deploy machine learning models that integrate with Ripjar's software products and data processing pipelines.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)

We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.<br><br>We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.<br><br>Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.<br><br>We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.<br><br>You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.<br><br><strong>What You'll Do<br><br></strong><ul><li>Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers</li><li>Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches</li><li>Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning</li><li>Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems</li><li>Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business</li><li>Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business<br><br></li></ul><strong>What You'll Need<br><br></strong><ul><li>Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support</li><li>1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots</li><li>3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve </li><li>A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives<br><br></li></ul><strong>It would be great if you had <br><br></strong><ul><li>Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies</li><li>Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.<br><br><em>Are you ready for a career with us?

Do you want to use data to bring about the next generation of transport decision making?

Are you an experienced data scientist?

Then we’d love for you to apply for this job!

You will play an essential role in putting data and data science at the heart of decision making, increasing the impact of data science in DfT. You will play a key role in growing the use of Data Science in the Department and applying it to high stakes decisions. You will work with and lead a range of colleagues, data engineers, digital leads, analytics colleagues, policy leads and external contractors.

Key to this role will be leading the data science team’s contribution to the delivery of the digital Connectivity Tool application. This innovative Tool aims to ensure new development is located in the right places, connected by the right infrastructure, to maximise sustainable growth. The web-based application fills an essential analytical gap in how transport connectivity is measured and scored. Improvements to the planning system are a ministerial priority and the Connectivity Tool will be an important contribution to the decision-making landscape.

Job Description

Key responsibilities include:


Lead and deliver high value data science projects, working autonomously to act as the main customer link, delivering to cost and time
Lead the data science team’s technical contribution to the delivery of the Connectivity Tool providing creative solutions to complex issues evaluating the approach against delivery risk and user requirements
Take an innovative approach to the maintenance of the Connectivity Tool’s existing data and identify opportunities for use of new data sources
Responsible for providing high quality advise on the best way to applying mathematical methodologies to the Tool, leading optioneering and solutioning discussions
Champion data science capability both within the team and across DfT
Lead engagement with key internal and external stakeholders to provide meaningful updates on key activities
Lead data science contributions to SCS reporting activities, including information gathering and quality checking


About The Team

The Planning Team are a multi-disciplinary centre of excellence specialising in providing credible expert spatial and transport planning advice. The team works across the full gamut of DfT policy interests, across all modes and work closely with each of the Department’s Arms Length Bodies. They have been pivotal in influencing the Government’s wider programme of planning reform and recently have been working with the Data Science Team in developing the policy landscape for the Connectivity Tool, extolling the transformational value the tool can have in delivering the homes, jobs and transport infrastructure needed to support the Government’s growth and health missions. Along with the PMO, you’ll join a high performing project team leading the data science inputs to the Connectivity Tool’s development and will be pivotal to driving success.

You will also have links into the wider analytical and data science communities who are ambitious about developing skills, expanding their reach and increasing their impact. You will contribute to the creation of new opportunities for DfT using the latest technology and tools: looking for projects which will deliver massive amounts of value: hundreds of millions of pounds in savings or improving transport for millions of people.

Person specification

You Will Need To Have Experience


Leading and delivering data science projects yourself and through others.
Engaging with Stakeholders to understand their needs and identify where data science can improve decision making.
Building technical capability in the team and organisation.
