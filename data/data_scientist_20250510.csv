About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

About The Team

Stripe Capital provides access to fast, flexible financing to small-and-medium businesses on Stripe to accelerate their growth, and we lent over $1B in 2024. Businesses use the funds for marketing, team growth, geographic expansion, working capital, new equipment purchases, and much more.

Machine learning is core to Stripe Capital’s business—we use information about businesses from their activity within and outside of Stripe and our models to automatically underwrite uniquely tailored financing offers to their needs, which banks are often unable to do. We are doing so through models with an established performance history, data infrastructure that is Stripe scale, and a strong feedback loop that includes explainability, anomaly detection and a risk portfolio management layer. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production.

What you’ll do

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing sales outreach strategies or building a sales forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for GTM analytics



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Revenue Operations, Finance, Growth, Marketing
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy



Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Sales, Customer Success, Revenue Operations, and/or Finance teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 - $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Job Summary

Clinical, imaging, and genetic data at scale are powerful tools for biological discovery and risk prediction. Carefully structured analyses and reproducible analytic pipelines accelerate ongoing efforts to gain clinically relevant insights.

Our research efforts are at the intersection of cardiovascular disease and human genetics—including both somatic and germline variation. Our clinical research efforts employ new techniques for deep phenotyping, such as deep learning. But these techniques rely on a solid foundation of classical bioinformatics. The Bioinformatics Programmer/Data Scientist will assist in managing, cleaning, and analyzing large scale medical data using a wide variety of analytic techniques, both in the cloud and with on-premises compute depending on data permissions. Experience with a cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud is a plus, and ability to learn how to manage cloud-based pipelines, and to perform cloud data management will be essential to learn. Maintaining bioinformatic databases by obtaining and restructuring data, including both UCSF proprietary data and public data, and writing tools to streamline discovery and replication analyses using these databases will be core responsibilities. An important task will be writing and maintaining analytic pipelines in languages such as R, python, Go, Rust, shell, SQL, WDL, and/or other appropriate languages, and using tools such as Docker. Experience with databases or the ability to learn will be requisite. Under the supervision of the PI, the Data Scientist will also be involved in data analysis, and will be comfortable with bioinformatic analyses including variant calling and annotation. There will be opportunities to employ cutting-edge methods and to develop new methods. The ability to learn and implement new techniques depending on the problem at hand will be an essential skill, thus requiring a strong foundation in computer programming. This position will also include administrative duties and will have the opportunity to participate in—and to lead—authorship teams.

The final salary and offer components are subject to additional approvals based on UC policy.

Please note: An offer will take into consideration the experience of the final candidate AND the current salary level of individuals working at UCSF in a similar role.

For roles covered by a bargaining unit agreement, there will be specific rules about where a new hire would be placed on the range.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments

Solid understanding of experimental design and statistical analysis.
Comfortable working in a remote environment and collaborating across time zones.

Bonus Points If You Have:

Experience in healthcare analytics, medical claims data, or patient engagement data.
Knowledge of HIPAA compliance, data privacy, or healthcare regulations.
Familiarity with cloud-based data environments like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Why Join Byram?

Experience with data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Looker.
Solid understanding of experimental design and statistical analysis.
Comfortable working in a remote environment and collaborating across time zones.

Bonus Points If You Have:

Experience in healthcare analytics, medical claims data, or patient engagement data.
Knowledge of HIPAA compliance, data privacy, or healthcare regulations.
Familiarity with cloud-based data environments like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Benefits

Work/Life Balance

Northstrat values true work life balance. We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning.

Pay Range

There are a host of factors that can influence final salary including, but not limited to, geographic location, Federal Government contract labor categories and contract wage rates, relevant prior work experience, specific skills and competencies, education, and certifications. We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and professional development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.

Flex Time

Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John's IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.

Individual Benefits Account (IBA)

To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset - the employee.

The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as:

IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee's monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee's salary.

Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)

The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee's behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee's compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.

Stock Options

Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.

Lifelong Learning

Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.

Join Our Talented Team

We hire the BEST employees and value each one. Since 2021, The Washington Post has recognized Northstrat among its ""Top Workplaces"". We think that your friends and family will like it here too, so we offer employee referral incentives.

Northstrat is an Equal Opportunity Employer

We are committed to fostering an inclusive, diverse workplace. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, veteran status or other legally protected status.

Every decision we make is rooted in improving health outcomes, optimizing operations, and delivering compassionate service—and we’re looking for a Data Scientist who shares our mission.

We’re hiring a Data Scientist to join our growing Analytics and Insights team. You’ll be working at the intersection of healthcare, technology, and business—turning raw data into actionable insights that impact real lives. This is a fully remote position, but you'll collaborate closely with cross-functional teams including operations, customer service, finance, and clinical services.

What You'll Do:

Build and deploy predictive models to support key initiatives such as patient retention, inventory forecasting, and operational efficiency.
Analyze large datasets from various sources (EHR systems, CRM, call centers, logistics platforms) to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement.
Partner with stakeholders across departments to define business problems, translate them into data questions, and deliver actionable results.
Design and implement experiments (A/B testing) to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, communications, or workflow changes.
Develop dashboards and automated reports that make data easily digestible for decision-makers.
Contribute to data governance and quality by identifying inconsistencies, supporting data pipeline improvements, and documenting processes.
Stay current with industry trends and best practices in data science, machine learning, and healthcare analytics.

Who You Are:

You’re a problem-solver by nature, curious and driven to uncover hidden insights.
You have strong communication skills—able to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders clearly and persuasively.
You understand that clean, reliable data is foundational, and you don’t shy away from data wrangling.
You care about healthcare and want to work on meaningful challenges that make a difference in people’s lives.

Requirements:

Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a Data Scientist or similar analytics role.
Proficiency in Python or R for data analysis and modeling.
Strong SQL skills and experience working with large relational databases.
Familiarity with machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, etc.).
Experience with data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Looker.
Solid understanding of experimental design and statistical analysis.
Comfortable working in a remote environment and collaborating across time zones.

Bonus Points If You Have:

Experience in healthcare analytics, medical claims data, or patient engagement data.
Knowledge of HIPAA compliance, data privacy, or healthcare regulations.
Familiarity with cloud-based data environments like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Location: Remote (USA)

Employment Type: Full-time

At Byram Healthcare, we believe that data has the power to transform patient care. As a leading provider of medical supplies and support services, we serve patients managing chronic conditions like diabetes, ostomy, incontinence, and wound care. Every decision we make is rooted in improving health outcomes, optimizing operations, and delivering compassionate service—and we’re looking for a Data Scientist who shares our mission.

We’re hiring a Data Scientist to join our growing Analytics and Insights team. You’ll be working at the intersection of healthcare, technology, and business—turning raw data into actionable insights that impact real lives. This is a fully remote position, but you'll collaborate closely with cross-functional teams including operations, customer service, finance, and clinical services.

What You'll Do:

Build and deploy predictive models to support key initiatives such as patient retention, inventory forecasting, and operational efficiency.
Analyze large datasets from various sources (EHR systems, CRM, call centers, logistics platforms) to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement.
Partner with stakeholders across departments to define business problems, translate them into data questions, and deliver actionable results.
Design and implement experiments (A/B testing) to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, communications, or workflow changes.
Develop dashboards and automated reports that make data easily digestible for decision-makers.
Contribute to data governance and quality by identifying inconsistencies, supporting data pipeline improvements, and documenting processes.
Stay current with industry trends and best practices in data science, machine learning, and healthcare analytics.

Who You Are:

You’re a problem-solver by nature, curious and driven to uncover hidden insights.
You have strong communication skills—able to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders clearly and persuasively.
You understand that clean, reliable data is foundational, and you don’t shy away from data wrangling.
You care about healthcare and want to work on meaningful challenges that make a difference in people’s lives.

Requirements:

Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a Data Scientist or similar analytics role.
Proficiency in Python or R for data analysis and modeling.
Strong SQL skills and experience working with large relational databases.
Familiarity with machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, etc.).
Experience with data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Looker.
Solid understanding of experimental design and statistical analysis.
Comfortable working in a remote environment and collaborating across time zones.

Bonus Points If You Have:

Experience in healthcare analytics, medical claims data, or patient engagement data.
Knowledge of HIPAA compliance, data privacy, or healthcare regulations.
Familiarity with cloud-based data environments like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Why Join Byram?

At Byram, we put patients first—and that starts with our team. As a remote-first employer, we provide the flexibility you need to do your best work while supporting a healthy work-life balance. You’ll be part of a mission-driven company that values empathy, innovation, and transparency.

Competitive salary and performance-based bonuses
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision coverage
401(k) with company match
Generous paid time off and holidays
Career development and learning opportunities
