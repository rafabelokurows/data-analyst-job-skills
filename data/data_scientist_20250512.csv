About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

About The Team

Stripe Capital provides access to fast, flexible financing to small-and-medium businesses on Stripe to accelerate their growth, and we lent over $1B in 2024. Businesses use the funds for marketing, team growth, geographic expansion, working capital, new equipment purchases, and much more.

Machine learning is core to Stripe Capital’s business—we use information about businesses from their activity within and outside of Stripe and our models to automatically underwrite uniquely tailored financing offers to their needs, which banks are often unable to do. We are doing so through models with an established performance history, data infrastructure that is Stripe scale, and a strong feedback loop that includes explainability, anomaly detection and a risk portfolio management layer. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer for Stripe Capital, you will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production with the goals of providing financing opportunities to as many users as possible while satisfying financial performance goals. You will work closely with software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and risk managers to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about building ML systems that touch the lives of millions. You have experience developing efficient feature pipelines, building advanced ML models, and deploying them to production. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, have a bias towards action, and thrive in a collaborative environment.

We’re looking for someone who can bring new ideas to the table on building models able to push the state of the art at Stripe, especially within the regulatory and operational constraints of a financing business.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of industry experience building and shipping ML systems in production
Proficient with ML libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, as well as Spark
Knowledge of various ML algorithms and model architectures
Hands-on experience in designing, training, and evaluating machine learning models
Hands-on experience in productionizing and deploying models at scale
Hands-on experience in orchestrating complicated data pipelines and efficiently leveraging large-scale datasets
Hands-on experience in collaborating across multiple teams, especially Data Science and Risk Management teams



Preferred Qualifications


MS/PhD degree in ML/AI or related field (e.g. math, physics, statistics)
Proven track record of building and deploying ML systems that have effectively solved ambiguous business problems
Experience in adversarial domains such as Lending, Trading, Fraud
Experience with Deep Learning including the latest architectures such as transformers, test-time compute, reinforcement learning



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $212,000 - $318,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

About The Team

Stripe Capital provides access to fast, flexible financing to small-and-medium businesses on Stripe to accelerate their growth, and we lent over $1B in 2024. Businesses use the funds for marketing, team growth, geographic expansion, working capital, new equipment purchases, and much more.

Machine learning is core to Stripe Capital’s business—we use information about businesses from their activity within and outside of Stripe and our models to automatically underwrite uniquely tailored financing offers to their needs, which banks are often unable to do. We are doing so through models with an established performance history, data infrastructure that is Stripe scale, and a strong feedback loop that includes explainability, anomaly detection and a risk portfolio management layer. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer for Stripe Capital, you will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production with the goals of providing financing opportunities to as many users as possible while satisfying financial performance goals. You will work closely with software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and risk managers to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about building ML systems that touch the lives of millions. You have experience developing efficient feature pipelines, building advanced ML models, and deploying them to production. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, have a bias towards action, and thrive in a collaborative environment.

We’re looking for someone who can bring new ideas to the table on building models able to push the state of the art at Stripe, especially within the regulatory and operational constraints of a financing business.

Minimum Requirements

Proven track record of building and deploying ML systems that have effectively solved ambiguous business problems
Experience in adversarial domains such as Lending, Trading, Fraud
Experience with Deep Learning including the latest architectures such as transformers, test-time compute, reinforcement learning



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $212,000 - $318,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

All voices are heard because we know that experience comes in many forms, skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

🌟 Your Impact at Lila

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

🛠️ What You'll Be Building


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


🧰 What You’ll Need To Succeed


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


🌈 We’re All In

Lila Sciences is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product in a high quality way. You’ll be exploring the boundaries of what’s possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion’s offering.

What You'll Achieve


Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver product features on time
Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends



Skills You'll Need To Bring


Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 3+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You’re excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.



Nice To Haves


You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation made due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco and New York, the estimated base salary range for this role is $170,000 - $250,000 per year.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

We are seeking a data scientist with a background in economics to support our work to understand the economic impacts of increasingly powerful AI systems. As a member of our Public Policy and Data Science and Analytics teams, you will play an instrumental role in our company’s mission of building beneficial artificial intelligence by scaling our understanding of how models are being used across industries and economies. You’ll be building and scaling a data driven culture from the ground up, while building a body of work that will help shape public policy. This is a unique role, in a unique company, technology, and moment in history; your work will be critical to informing company and external stakeholders as we deploy frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with public policy leadership and societal impact researchers, as well as engineering and go-to-market leaders to define and measure key company economic metrics, analyze product behavior and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You will bring an economist's mind to your data science work, preparing internal and external reports that will inform how the world should think about AI’s impact on economies. With potential timelines for powerful AI systems as early as 2026, this role demands both technical acumen and strategic foresight. You’ve worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into user behavior data to provide insights to policy leaders and influence the company’s product, strategy, and policy priorities.
Define core economic metrics that measure how AI is being used in the economy. Set goals, build forecasts, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting
Identify and size opportunities to improve our societal impacts research and public policy agenda through your insights and recommendations.
Develop hypotheses on economic impacts of our products, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics.
Working with the policy team, write and publish internal and external reports on the economic impacts of AI that provide unique insights and perspectives on the usage of the technology.
Create data systems that can be responsive to inquiries from external experts and policymakers.
Build a data driven culture from the ground up by establishing foundational data best practices and making data more accessible across the company.


You May Be a Good Fit If You Have


6+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in a data infrastructure or operations context.
3+ years of experience of data analysis at the intersection of economics and industry
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI.
Background in public policy and economics
Expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective.
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress.
Demonstrate analytical capabilities in assessing policy implications of emerging technologies.
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions.
Experience in turning open questions and data into concise and insightful analysis.
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills.
Experience translating technical and data work to non-technical audiences


Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 - $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Full-time / Onsite (5 days/week)

About The Role

We’re a telehealth company helping people lose weight at scale. Our internal team is core to delivering care—but scaling care delivery is messy, complex, and full of hidden inefficiencies. We’re looking for a Data Scientist who thrives on turning operational chaos into clarity. As a data scientist at Mochi Health, you’ll have the opportunity to work with and support various departments from marketing to operations. You’ll combine analytical thinking with engineering pragmatism—owning dashboards, automating workflows, uncovering bottlenecks, and building internal tools that let our team move faster with less friction. This role is ideal for someone who wants impact, autonomy, and real-world complexity.

What You’ll Do


Own the full lifecycle of operational metrics—from KPI design to dashboard deployment and stakeholder adoption.
Design metrics that drive accountability, surface inefficiencies, and guide automation.
Automate high-friction workflows using Python, APIs, and lightweight tools.
Integrate Generative AI and LLMs to optimize and augment workflows.
Apply causal inference, forecasting, or A/B testing where necessary.
Choose the right surface for delivery—Tableau, Streamlit, Google Sheets—based on context and audience.


Who You Are


Bachelor’s or Master’s in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering).
2+ years of experience using data to solve product, marketing, or business problems.
Strong Python and SQL skills; write clean, maintainable code.
Experienced in building dashboards (e.g. Tableau) and internal tools (e.g. Streamlit).
Curious, self-directed, and impact-driven—you chase high-leverage problems.
Clear communicator who can simplify the complex for any audience.
Comfortable with ambiguity and switching contexts in a fast-moving environment.

Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


🧰 What You’ll Need To Succeed


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Benefits

Work/Life Balance

Northstrat values true work life balance. We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning.

Pay Range

There are a host of factors that can influence final salary including, but not limited to, geographic location, Federal Government contract labor categories and contract wage rates, relevant prior work experience, specific skills and competencies, education, and certifications. We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and professional development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.

Flex Time

Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John's IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.

Individual Benefits Account (IBA)

To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset - the employee.

The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as:

IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee's monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee's salary.

Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)

The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee's behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee's compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.

Stock Options

Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.

Lifelong Learning

Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.

Join Our Talented Team

We hire the BEST employees and value each one. Since 2021, The Washington Post has recognized Northstrat among its ""Top Workplaces"". We think that your friends and family will like it here too, so we offer employee referral incentives.

Northstrat is an Equal Opportunity Employer

We are committed to fostering an inclusive, diverse workplace. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, veteran status or other legally protected status.

At Netflix, our mission is to connect global stories with audiences worldwide. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story or a game that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.

By crafting compelling and targeted marketing strategies, we strive to capture the attention of potential members and convert their interest into subscriptions. Additionally, we focus on increasing conversation and excitement about Netflix and our content, creating buzz and anticipation that encourages both current and prospective members to explore and engage with our diverse offerings.

Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order; however, the Promo Media Algo team, with assistance from creative supervision and member feedback data, have built tools & processes that use technologies like Computer Vision, and Machine Learning to enable our creators to tell the best version of the story they want while allowing our studio to scale further.

Our team is dedicated to pioneering the development of innovative tools and processes that leverage technologies like Computer Vision and Machine Learning. By integrating creative supervision and valuable member feedback, we create solutions that empower our stakeholders in Promo Media and Marketing. These advancements enhance storytelling capabilities and streamline workflows, enabling efficient scaling and making a significant impact on how we deliver compelling content to our global audience.

Job Description

We’re hiring a Data Scientist to help us drive innovation and excellence in marketing performance measurement. This is a hands-on, high-impact role ideal for someone who’s both a builder and a thinker – someone who codes with intent, models with depth, and communicates with clarity.




You will:
Lead development of advanced marketing analytics solutions from concept to deployment
Design and implement machine learning models with sound statistical underpinnings
Guide junior analysts and coordinate cross-functional project teams
Translate marketing business challenges into robust analytical frameworks
Partner with global stakeholders to deliver insights that influence strategy
Build, test, and deploy scalable pipelines and automation systems
Ensure analytical outputs meet high technical and business standards





Required Qualifications
Master’s in Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science, or a quantitative discipline
2 – 3 years of experience in data science or analytics, ideally with project leadership
Strong Python programming skills
Solid grounding in statistical inference, regression, time series, and machine learning theory
Experience with cloud tools (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure), SQL, and version control (Git)
Business-level fluency in English (written and spoken)
Prior exposure to marketing science or media measurement a BIG plus





Preferred Technical Experience
Critical thinkers who know why a model works, not just how to run it
Problem solvers who love turning ambiguity into clear analytical plans
Communicators who can translate model outputs into business actions
Builders who take pride in creating elegant, scalable, and well-documented solutions
Leaders who can inspire, coach, and challenge others to do their best work

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

At Netflix, our mission is to connect global stories with audiences worldwide. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story or a game that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.

Beyond connecting global stories with existing audiences, we also aim to reach new subscribers and increase engagement through innovative marketing campaigns. By crafting compelling and targeted marketing strategies, we strive to capture the attention of potential members and convert their interest into subscriptions. Additionally, we focus on increasing conversation and excitement about Netflix and our content, creating buzz and anticipation that encourages both current and prospective members to explore and engage with our diverse offerings.

Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order; however, the Promo Media Algo team, with assistance from creative supervision and member feedback data, have built tools & processes that use technologies like Computer Vision, and Machine Learning to enable our creators to tell the best version of the story they want while allowing our studio to scale further.

Our team is dedicated to pioneering the development of innovative tools and processes that leverage technologies like Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

Build & Deploy Safely on OpenShift AI: Design, develop, containerize, and deploy AI-powered features and models using Red Hat OpenShift AI components (e.g., Workbenches, Model Registry, Pipelines), ensuring alignment with responsible AI principles and safety requirements from the outset.
Integrate & Vet AI Services: Leverage and critically evaluate open-source models (e.g., Granite), integrating them safely, securely, and responsibly within applications running on OpenShift. Assess models for potential biases and safety risks before integration.
Master AI Safety & OpenShift Toolkits: Utilize AI engineering frameworks, vector databases, and specific tools within OpenShift AI for AI safety, explainability, bias detection, development, serving, monitoring, and automation of the AI system lifecycle.
Design & Implement Guardrails: Design, implement, and test robust safety guardrails for AI interactions, including input validation, prompt safety techniques, output content filtering, and oversight mechanisms for RAG patterns. Automate these checks using OpenShift Pipelines and GitOps practices where applicable.
Manage Models with MLOps & Safety: Utilize (and sometimes contribute to building) models and leverage OpenShift AI Serving technologies to deploy, manage versions, and continuously monitor for performance, safety metrics, bias, and drift, ensuring the reliability and ethical operation of AI models in production.
Evaluate Holistically: Focus on product-specific evaluation of AI models and approaches, rigorously assessing their performance, safety, fairness, bias, robustness, cost, and adherence to ethical guidelines within the OpenShift environment.
Stay Current on Safety & AI: Keep pace with advancements in the general AI landscape (models, techniques), especially emerging threats, mitigation techniques, AI safety research, and relevant regulatory landscapes, alongside OpenShift AI platform features.
Collaborate for Trust: Work closely with product managers, application developers, platform engineers, data scientists, and relevant governance/ethics/security teams to integrate AI capabilities smoothly, ensuring systems are trustworthy, compliant, and adhere to enterprise standards.


Who You Are


A Safety-Conscious Builder with Platform Sense: You have a strong software engineering background (Python proficiency is key, Java is a plus), understand containerization (Docker, Podman), Kubernetes/OpenShift fundamentals, and prioritize building secure and safe systems.
AI Practitioner Aware of Risks: You actively experiment with Foundation Models (LLMs, etc.), understand how to apply them practically, and are keenly aware of their potential risks, limitations, and ethical considerations.
OpenShift AI Familiar: You have hands-on experience with Red Hat OpenShift AI / OpenShift Data Science and its core components (Model Serving, Pipelines, Workbenches). Understanding of MLOps concepts is essential.
Tool-Savvy with a Safety Lens: You’re familiar with the AI engineering stack (LLama Stack, LangChain, Vector DBs, etc.) and are eager to apply or learn tools/techniques specifically for AI safety, explainability, and bias mitigation within an OpenShift context.
Pragmatic & Responsible: You focus on building useful, reliable AI features, with a strong commitment to responsible AI development, deployment, and minimizing potential harm.
Fast Learner: You thrive in the fast-paced AI field and are comfortable continuously learning new platform features, AI techniques, and safety best practices.
Not Necessarily an ML PhD: Your strength lies in applying, deploying, and safeguarding AI models effectively using platform tools, rather than deep theoretical research. Practical experience is paramount.


Nice-to-Haves


Experience implementing AI safety techniques (e.g., input/output filtering, adversarial testing, bias detection/mitigation, explainability methods like LIME/SHAP).
Direct experience deploying various types of ML models (including LLMs) using OpenShift AI Model Serving (KServe/Caikit/TGIS) with integrated safety checks.
Experience building and running OpenShift Pipelines (e.g., Tekton) that include safety validation steps.
Familiarity with AI ethics frameworks and relevant regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF).
Familiarity with the broader Red Hat portfolio (e.g., Ansible, RHEL, AMQ Streams/Kafka, Ceph).
