We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Out humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

• Work with tracking and filtering methods such as Kalman filters and Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) for dynamic object tracking.
• Integrate and calibrate perception sensors with high-precision requirements (camera, radar, LiDAR).
• Simulate and test perception systems in virtual environments (e.g., Carla, AirSim) and validate them in diverse real-world conditions (night, rain, fog).
• Collaborate closely with SLAM, mapping, and planning teams to ensure consistent scene representation and performance.

Requirements:
• Solid background in computer vision and deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, 3D CNNs), with a focus on real-time image and point cloud processing.
• Experience with sensor fusion, tracking, and object detection frameworks (YOLO, SSD, Mask R-CNN, etc.).
• Skilled in Python/C++ and tools like OpenCV, PCL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and CUDA.
• Familiarity with ROS/ROS2, Carla, SUMO, or other AV simulation frameworks.
• Proven ability in calibration and integration of perception sensors; understanding of HD Maps and environmental feature extraction.
• Knowledge of SLAM and localization techniques is a strong plus.
• Experience with testing and validation of perception systems in safety-critical environments.

Nice to Have:
• Experience with reinforcement learning or decision-making algorithms in unstructured environments.
• Hands-on work with parallel processing (CUDA/OpenCL) and real-time optimization.
• Familiarity with HD maps, OpenStreetMap integration, and high-resolution semantic mapping.

Why You Should Join Us:
• Play a central role in shaping how our vehicles see and interpret the world.
• Join an ambitious, science-driven team that values deep collaboration and continuous learning.

How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?

What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?


The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world.

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare.

Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 118 million registered users and 243,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 443+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.198.000 tonnes of CO2e!

We are seeking a talented and driven Marketing Data Scientist to join us in shaping the future of our newly established Demand and Marketing Analytics team. The successful candidate will play a pivotal role in enhancing our team's capabilities around Marketing analytics while benefiting from a robust support structure designed to foster growth and innovation.

The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasising the importance of experience with causal impact modelling and econometric modelling.

That said, your role may extend beyond marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

You have hands-on experience working closely with senior stakeholders, ideally within Marketing, to deliver data-driven insights.
You are a great communicator and storyteller - someone who enjoys helping non-technical audiences see what you see in the numbers!
You are skilled in designing, executing, and interpreting A/B tests, applying causal inference models, and impact modeling techniques in marketing.
You have econometric modeling experience; familiarity with marketing mix models (MMM) is a big plus.
You are proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation and have Python expertise for data preprocessing, statistical analysis. R is a plus.
You are passionate about data literacy, continuously striving to improve your own skills and those of your team.
You are fluent in English.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.

The School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine & Sciences (Head, Professor Mauro Giacca) provides an outstanding multi-disciplinary environment for the pursuit of cutting-edge cardiovascular and metabolic research . Our current research spans the fundamental molecular, cellular, and physiological processes that underly normal and abnormal cardiovascular and metabolic function and drive the translation of this strong basic science into advances in clinical practice. The School occupies facilities across the Guy’s, St Thomas’ and Denmark Hill campuses of King’s College London and comprises over 70 clinical and non-clinical academic groups, hosting 400 personnel and 110 PhD students. Clinical and pre-clinical researchers at King’s have access to a state-of-the art core facilities and expertise, including multimodality in vivo imaging, clinical research facilities, experimental medicine hub, high-throughput robotic screening, comprehensive 3 genomics/proteomics/metabolomics/single cell analyses, integrative invasive and non-invasive human physiology, comprehensive murine physiology and genetic modification, etc. There is an innovative clinical informatics platform integrated with large language models for the analyses of electronic health records across the King’s Health Partner NHS Trusts. Assisted by the close collaboration between clinical and academic colleagues and the outstanding infrastructure, all the building blocks are in place for the generation of novel advances with major clinical impact. The School hosts a range of training programmes including three PhD programmes in cardiovascular sciences and advanced therapies, an MSc in Cardiovascular Sciences and an iBSc in Cardiovascular Medicine. Multiple other doctoral training programmes are available across the Faculty.

About The Role

The postholder will contribute to development of our portfolio of clinical and health informatics platforms and research which sits within the King’s BHF Centre of Research Excellence (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/scms/bhf-centre) and specifically work within the Coronary Research Group at KCL.

The Coronary Research Group carries out translational research into the mechanisms and consequences of cardiac ischaemia with a view to developing and evaluating novel and personalised treatments for ischaemic heart disease. The group employs diverse research methodologies to achieve these aims, from exploration of the pathophysiological basis of disease states by detailed characterisation of patients during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through designing and conducting multicentre randomised clinical trials to applying machine learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to data extracted from routine health records. The work will also include areas relevant to the BHF Centre Themes including heart failure, obesity and metabolic diseases with the scope of extending the timeframe of the contract based on the receipt of renewed funding. The Group’s research is funded by peer-reviewed grants from charities (including the Academy of Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation and Medical Research Council) and public funding (UK National Institute for Health Research and US National Institute for Health) as well as investigator-initiated commercial funding.

The primary purpose of this role is to develop a cohort identification tool for cardiovascular research using multimodal electronic health records data. This will require the development of both the tool itself and a number of clinical phenotyping algorithms. This new tool will be part of the CogStack ecosystem, currently being deployed to multiple hospitals for near real-time analytics for direct patient care, streamlining services and research ([](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299; https://cogstack.github.io/). A key component of this system is our clinical NLP tool MedCAT ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10166; https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT).

The role will build clinical NLP and phenotyping using electronic health records, putting these tools in the hands of clinical users. As such this tool is a foundational piece of work to enable a multitude of subsequent projects and grant applications which use this software to identify a cohort of patients from the EHR.

This is a 50% FTE post (17.5 hours per week), and you will be offered a fixed term contract for 8 months.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)


If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive. 

That's why, since 2016, we've been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they're at the heart of everything we do.

We've sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.


About the role

We are seeking a skilled Mid-Level Software Engineer with 2-4 years hands-on experience in software development. You'll ideally have a solid grounding in Python and object-oriented programming, a strong problem-solving mindset, and a passion for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. This role focuses on general programming competence over framework expertise, ideal for a developer who thrives in finding solutions to technical challenges.


What you will be doing

Develop, test, and maintain Python code for a variety of applications
Analyse, troubleshoot, and solve complex programming problems
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and deliver well-structured solutions
Write clear, concise, and well-documented code that adheres to industry best practices
Contribute to code reviews, offering feedback to ensure code quality across the team
Continuously learn and adapt to new technologies and development practices



About you

2-4 years of experience in Python development (if your primary language isn't Python but you have strong backend experience and are open to working in Python, we'd still love to hear from you!)
Strong understanding of Python fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming
Excellent problem-solving skills and ability to work independently on assigned tasks
Familiarity with version control systems (e.g., Git)
Basic knowledge of testing frameworks and a solid approach to debugging and refactoring
Ability to work in a fast-paced environment with evolving requirements
Strong analytical skills and attention to detail
Interest in software optimisation and performance tuning
An understanding of SQL and document databases
Collaborative mindset with excellent communication skills



What's it like to work at Zego?

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things. 

We're spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We're proud of our company and our culture - a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

Together, we're setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There's loads of room to learn and grow, and you'll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you want.

You'll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren't afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we're making insurance matter. 


How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. We think it's a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.


Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you'll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. And that's just for starters. We also cover the costs for all company-wide events (3 per year), and also provide a separate hybrid contribution to help pay towards other travel costs. 


We're an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)


If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

We are building a platform for inventors to accelerate their work throughout the entire IP lifecycle by providing them with best in class software, leveraging LLMs, for IP search, patent filing, freedom-to-operate analysis and infringement detection.




With the growing complexity and volume of IP today, traditional software is no longer meeting the needs of inventors. Many companies are turning to us to help them stay at the forefront of innovation by cutting through the noise of the millions of patents filed each year.




We believe we are the right team to tackle this problem.

World class team of engineers and product leaders from Palantir, Amazon, Twitter, BCG, and top startups. Together, we have a proven track record of tackling tough problems and delivering mission-driven software.
We are growing rapidly with increasing customer traction. We are already working with the world's most innovative organisations (Fortune 500 companies and top patent filers) to solve critical needs with our product.
We are backed by Tier 1 VCs and Angel Investors, including Index Ventures, co-founders of Hugging Face, CEO of Datadog, and product experts from DeepMind and OpenAI.




We are now growing the team to reach our ambitions. We hire the best and reward accordingly.

Compensation & Equity: We offer competitive compensation and a generous equity package, making you an owner of the company.
Career Growth: You have the opportunity to shape your role, own the impact, grow with the company, and build your skills to accelerate your career at Ankar and beyond.
Meaningful Work: You will have full ownership in tackling challenging problems and help progress innovation in a world that is more and more faced with stagnation. We were founded in early 2024 and you have a real opportunity to shape what we do here.




What you will be doing




Build a first-class AI-enabled platform in a high-ownership environment, where you’ll be leading development across the backend, ML service, ML infrastructure, and data pipelines.
Fine-tune and deploy large language models for patent search, analysis, drafting, and other intellectual property workflows.
Evaluate and improve large language model outputs for quality, relevance, and accuracy.
Develop and optimise search retrievals and ranking models for large-scale patent and technical literature datasets.
Productionise ML models within AWS, including deployment, monitoring, and integration with backend services.




What we are looking for




Has a track record of building world class software. Ideally you have 3+ years of experience building ML applications.
Thrives in a fast-paced & ambiguous environment. You work quickly and iteratively. We work in one-week sprints to ensure we are delivering value and and leading the market.
Seeks ownership. You own your work, approach problems critically, and take pride in what you build. We believe this is the best way to for you to grow and for the product to succeed. We create the environment to help you thrive as an owner.
Wants to work in-person. At this stage of our company, we believe being in the same space enables better communication, quicker decision-making, and fosters a collaborative culture that empowers us to outpace the competition.
[Bonus points] Has experience deploying production ML applications, working with reranking & fine tuning strategies, and/or building large scale content indexing systems.




We believe in people who are driven by curiosity, willing to learn and able to go the extra mile. Please also reach out if you don't exactly ""check all these boxes"".




What else you might want to know




Location: London (no remote)
Contract: Full-time
Compensation: We pay competitive salaries and will reward you with a substantial equity package under the tax-efficient EMI scheme.
Hiring process: (1) 30min introductory chat, (2) 1hr technical interview, (3) 2hr on-site, and (4) 20min final co-founder meeting. The process can be as fast you want it to be.

The School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine & Sciences (Head, Professor Mauro Giacca) provides an outstanding multi-disciplinary environment for the pursuit of cutting-edge cardiovascular and metabolic research . Our current research spans the fundamental molecular, cellular, and physiological processes that underly normal and abnormal cardiovascular and metabolic function and drive the translation of this strong basic science into advances in clinical practice. The School occupies facilities across the Guy’s, St Thomas’ and Denmark Hill campuses of King’s College London and comprises over 70 clinical and non-clinical academic groups, hosting 400 personnel and 110 PhD students. Clinical and pre-clinical researchers at King’s have access to a state-of-the art core facilities and expertise, including multimodality in vivo imaging, clinical research facilities, experimental medicine hub, high-throughput robotic screening, comprehensive 3 genomics/proteomics/metabolomics/single cell analyses, integrative invasive and non-invasive human physiology, comprehensive murine physiology and genetic modification, etc. There is an innovative clinical informatics platform integrated with large language models for the analyses of electronic health records across the King’s Health Partner NHS Trusts. Assisted by the close collaboration between clinical and academic colleagues and the outstanding infrastructure, all the building blocks are in place for the generation of novel advances with major clinical impact. The School hosts a range of training programmes including three PhD programmes in cardiovascular sciences and advanced therapies, an MSc in Cardiovascular Sciences and an iBSc in Cardiovascular Medicine. Multiple other doctoral training programmes are available across the Faculty.

About The Role

The postholder will contribute to development of our portfolio of clinical and health informatics platforms and research which sits within the King’s BHF Centre of Research Excellence (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/scms/bhf-centre) and specifically work within the Coronary Research Group at KCL.

The Coronary Research Group carries out translational research into the mechanisms and consequences of cardiac ischaemia with a view to developing and evaluating novel and personalised treatments for ischaemic heart disease. The group employs diverse research methodologies to achieve these aims, from exploration of the pathophysiological basis of disease states by detailed characterisation of patients during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through designing and conducting multicentre randomised clinical trials to applying machine learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to data extracted from routine health records. The work will also include areas relevant to the BHF Centre Themes including heart failure, obesity and metabolic diseases with the scope of extending the timeframe of the contract based on the receipt of renewed funding. The Group’s research is funded by peer-reviewed grants from charities (including the Academy of Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation and Medical Research Council) and public funding (UK National Institute for Health Research and US National Institute for Health) as well as investigator-initiated commercial funding.

The primary purpose of this role is to develop a cohort identification tool for cardiovascular research using multimodal electronic health records data. This will require the development of both the tool itself and a number of clinical phenotyping algorithms. This new tool will be part of the CogStack ecosystem, currently being deployed to multiple hospitals for near real-time analytics for direct patient care, streamlining services and research ([](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9ls9J9AmM; https://doi.org/10.1101/123299; https://cogstack.github.io/). A key component of this system is our clinical NLP tool MedCAT ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10166; https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT).

The role will build clinical NLP and phenotyping using electronic health records, putting these tools in the hands of clinical users. As such this tool is a foundational piece of work to enable a multitude of subsequent projects and grant applications which use this software to identify a cohort of patients from the EHR.

This is a 50% FTE post (17.5 hours per week), and you will be offered a fixed term contract for 8 months.

You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
