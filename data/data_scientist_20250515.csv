Design, build and evolve Prima’s proprietary predictive technology, in topics such as the prediction of future claims, tactical pricing, renewal probability, fraud detection and customer lifetime value, etc;
Define and support the implementation in each country of the key tools to understand how the business is growing, for example, conversion, retention, emerging profitability. The monitoring tools need to be consistent at a global level and at the same time able to adapt to the different stages of evolution of each country;
Support the countries in planning the pricing and UW strategy and consequent follow up;
Develop a strong critical spirit and creativity that can act as an engine for Prima's growth.

Quale sarà la tua sfida? 

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere. 

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 5 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus. 

Il/La Data Scientist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze di AI e Machine Learning, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in algoritmi e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi. 

I/Le nostri/e Data Scientist verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove comprenderanno le esigenze del Cliente, daranno indicazione ai Data Engineer sulla preparazione desiderata dei dati, sceglieranno o costruiranno i migliori mix di modelli più adatti al caso specifico, discuteranno gli output con il cliente e consegneranno il modello per l’ottimizzazione e passaggio in produzione finale ai Data Engineer. 

In contesti più semplificati in cui la componente di Data Engineering è meno elaborata, i nostri Data Scientist procederanno in autonomia anche nella data preparation e nel porting in produzione dei modelli ingegnerizzati. 

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Data Scientist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

We want to innovate the financial services offered by commercial/retail banks in Italy in the areas of wealth management, credit lending, risk management and compliance. Building on our consolidated expertise and product offering in the Capital Markets domain, we want to scale our solutions and frameworks to the commercial/retail banking industry. To do so, we start from the quantitative modelling and analysis of the current processes put in place by our customers, so that we can profile opportunities of automation and prioritize client needs on manual/painful workflows. The resource will be involved in business process analyses of Italian commercial/retail financial institutions and is expected to integrate structured information extracted from interviews with the analysis of literature and documentation to build a quantitative picture of the AS-IS. The analysis will then be complemented with a consequent implementation analysis and product roadmap definition to design the TO-BE and drive product evolutions and developments. The project entails modelling complex business contexts, extracting structured information from unstructured sources, performing quantitative analyses, presenting findings and recommendations to external clients and internal stakeholders, contributing to the definition of product backlogs.

What You Will Learn During Your Intern


Quantitative modelling of business processes
Codification of customer requirements, needs, activities
Business intelligence with PowerBI/Excel - Packaging high-quality deliverables for external clients –
Data manipulation with Pandas or Spark/Hive


What You Need To Know

Quale sarà la tua sfida? 

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere. 

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 5 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus. 

Il/La Data Scientist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze di AI e Machine Learning, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in algoritmi e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi. 

I/Le nostri/e Data Scientist verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove comprenderanno le esigenze del Cliente, daranno indicazione ai Data Engineer sulla preparazione desiderata dei dati, sceglieranno o costruiranno i migliori mix di modelli più adatti al caso specifico, discuteranno gli output con il cliente e consegneranno il modello per l’ottimizzazione e passaggio in produzione finale ai Data Engineer. 

In contesti più semplificati in cui la componente di Data Engineering è meno elaborata, i nostri Data Scientist procederanno in autonomia anche nella data preparation e nel porting in produzione dei modelli ingegnerizzati. 

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Data Scientist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

Junior scientist or postdoctoral researcher in AI/ML for Climate Adaptation and Decision-Making
Deadline: May 31th, 2025



WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

We are seeking 2 motivated and talented Junior Scientists or Postdoctoral Researchers to join our growing team in the field of AI and Machine Learning for climate adaptation and decision-making. This position is ideal for candidates with strong analytical and computational backgrounds who are passionate about developing innovative tools to support the design of resilient systems under deep uncertainty.
The successful candidate will contribute to the development of AI/ML methods applied to:

the characterization and forecasting of extreme climate events (e.g., heatwaves, floods, droughts),
the emulation of complex Earth system and infrastructure models (climate-energy-water systems),
technological scenario generation and exploration via generative AI and reinforcement learning,
and the integration of these methods within robust decision-making (RDM) frameworks.

The role involves both methodological innovation and application to real-world case studies, with a focus on supporting climate-resilient infrastructure design and planning.
We are particularly interested in candidates who can bridge the gap between data-driven AI techniques and physics-based modeling, and who are excited to work on interdisciplinary research that connects climate science, engineering, and decision analysis.

Sibill is the accounting and financial operating system for small and medium businesses (SMBs).

Italy is the single largest EU country by number of SMBs. Italian SMBs employ 75% of workforce and generate two thirds of the country GDP. We want to unlock Italian SMBs productivity. Old tooling, manual processes, sparse data cause an average 8 hours/week wasted by our entrepreneurs. It simply can’t keep being as it is. Sibill gives this time back to entrepreneurs by bringing invoicing, payments, treasury and accounting in a single, modern platform.

International venture capital investors like Keen Venture Partners (Fiscozen), Founders A/S (Pleo), Exor Ventures (Qonto, Alan), Notion Capital - and many others - believe in our mission and pledged their capital to make it happen.

We are a product-driven company with a pragmatic approach to solve real problems. We count several thousands of entrepreneurs as customers. We want to get to millions - this is just the beginning.




What we look for

We are looking for a motivated, pragmatic, and goal-oriented Senior Data Scientist to join our Data team.




You are the perfect fit if...

You are passionate about technology, statistics and business. The three of them.
You don’t feel “done” yet, you want to keep learning and applying science to drive business outcome. You still want to be hands-on.
You are excited about working in a flat, no-politics, fast-paced environment.
You have excellent analytical skills and and a sharp eye for detail.
You are not scared of working hard. As a team, we all have to go the extra-mile to make it happen.
You feel like fitting the values we share at Sibill: ambition, pragmatism, efficiency, integrity




What you will do

You will report directly to the chief data officer/ co-founder. You will work with him and build all the data products that empower our customers to run their business better. This will not be a one-man standing. It will take a lot of cross-functional work with the people in our data, engineering, product, design teams.

We sit on top of the most business-critical company data. Money flows, bank transactions, invoices, cash register records, payables and receivables, general ledger records. We are the accounting & finance operating system of our customers. You will build data products that use this vast information set to solve specific customer problems.

Your responsibilities will include:

Discovery, domain understanding, data collection and experimentation
Model development (training / test / validation)
Performance monitoring and iteration over existing data products

Examples of projects you could work on from month one at Sibill:

Refining our autoreconciliation search algorithm (matching invoices with related financial money flows) to try and improve f-score.
Building a classification model to label general ledger records with the right chart of accounts codes.




What you will need

M.Sc./Ph.D. in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics or a related STEM field. You won’t be asked to send rockets to Mars - but a solid background in probability, stats, linear algebra and computational mathematics will give you an edge.
Modern Python and modern software development tools (Docker, CI/CD, unit testing, evals). We do not run data pipelines built on Jupyter Notebooks in production. Bonus point if you know you way around vector stores.
Proven expertise in leading model development using a wide range of techniques. Previous expertise in domains with high usage of neural networks (NLP, computer vision) is highly beneficial.
Especially at the beginning, an end-to-end data ownership mindset. It will not happen every day but - if necessary - you might be asked to build your own data pipeline end-to-end, to write a batch ETL, to write Elixir or TypeScript code, or to support teammates with an important one-off empirical analysis.
Fluency in English and Italian.
Bonus point: at least 7-8 years of experience. You have already coached and mentored junior colleagues.




Comp & Benefits

RAL: 70-90k
Employee stock options
Health insurance (AON)
Lunch voucher (8€/business day)
Full remote (based in Italy). We will just ask you to come to Milan for a few weeks during the onboarding (trip is on us)
You will work within a team of smart, hard-worker, passionate and nice human beings. People in Sibill tend to be very happy. Happiness is an underrated benefit ;-)




Recruiting process

30 minutes “know-each-other” session with Dario (Chief Data Officer)
45 minutes technical interview
you will meet some of the key people you will work with (engineering, data, product)
45 minutes with Mattia (CEO) and Lorenzo (Chief Product Officer)

Iemand die samen met ons wil groeien!




ACA’s Innovation Lab is het nieuwe businessconcept van ACA Group. In ons Innovation Lab groeien innovatieve ideeën uit tot gevalideerde businessconcepten.




Hoe wij (samen)werken?




Omdat wij een relatief nieuw team zijn, hanteren we geen ‘business-as-usual’ proces. We werken in een dynamische omgeving die eigenlijk vergelijkbaar is met een start-up binnen een groter geheel. ACA investeert een substantieel deel van haar winst in het “ACA Innovation Lab” zodat er ruimte is om nieuwe ideeën en technologieën af te toetsen.

We hebben bij ACA gekozen voor een proactieve aanpak om innovatie (AI en Machine Learning) bij onze klanten te stimuleren. Dit heeft ons de kans gegeven om samen met onze klanten een aantal nieuwe oplossingen te ontwikkelen door het gebruik van AI en ML.




Waar jij mee aan zal werken (tech & omgeving)?




Python & Java
Kubernetes & Kubeflow
AWS / GCP
Jupyter notebooks
Git
Tensorflow
Machine Vision toolkits (YOLO, OpenCV, …)
Wandb
MLFlow




Ben jij de geknipte persoon voor deze rol?




Hard skills

Je hebt minstens 3 jaar relevante ervaring met Machine Learning.
Je hebt ervaring als tech lead in een nieuwe start-up omgeving.
Je hebt een goede kennis van het Engels en/of Nederlands.
Je hebt een goede kennis van software development.
Je flexibel kunnen opstellen in een dynamische werkomgeving. Prioriteiten stellen vormen voor jou dan ook geen probleem.
Ervaring in een test-driven development en Agile omgeving.




Soft skills

Je bezit goede communicatieve vaardigheden.
Je bent een teamplayer, maar je gaat ook graag zelfstandig te werk.
Je bent proactief ingesteld en gemotiveerd om nieuwe uitdagingen aan te gaan!




Hoe voelt dat, werken bij ACA?




Innovatieve werkomgeving: je werkt met de nieuwste technologie en tools in een omgeving die innovatie uitademt.
Een aantrekkelijk loon, een bedrijfswagen, maaltijdcheques, onkostenvergoeding, MacBook Pro en nog veel meer.
Leren & groeien: bij ACA heeft iedereen een on-the-job coach. Je beschikt over een persoonlijk evolutieplan met een budget voor technische en professionele trainingen en heel wat kansen om bij te leren.
We’ve got your back: we voorzien een uitgebreid gezondheids- en verzekeringsplan om tegemoet te komen aan jouw noden. Het is onze prioriteit om ervoor te zorgen dat onze collega’s gelukkig zijn, o.a. door een goede work-life balans, de juiste tools te voorzien, enzovoort.
Onze unieke bedrijfscultuur: je bent deel van een passioneel en hardwerkend team dat trots is op hun verwezenlijkingen. ACA is een plek waar teamwork, transparantie, kennisdeling en erkenning centraal staan. Trots om ons ""Great Place To Work"" te noemen!
Jij staat centraal: wij zijn gedreven door onze teamleden waarbij iedereen hun steentje bijdraagt, maar waar plaats is voor heel wat fun. Een fantastisch team werkt niet alleen samen, maar maakt ook samen plezier. Daarom organiseren we heel wat activiteiten binnen en buiten onze kantoren en vertrekken we elk jaar op een spetterend ACA-weekend!

We encourage our team members to be proactive in identifying areas for improvement, and we value those who take the initiative to implement positive changes. Our goal is to leave a lasting, positive impact on our projects and our team.

We are data-driven

Lastly, our team is data-driven. We believe that making informed decisions based on data is crucial to our success.

Please attach all the documents asked.




CONTEXT

The Royal Military Academy (RMA) is a military institution and is fully recognized as a university, fulfilling the same criteria as civilian universities. The RMA is also conducting scientific research at university level for projects funded by the Belgian Defense department or external sources.

In the framework of the study DREAM (Distributed REconnaissance And Mapping with a multi-robot system), we are looking for a full-time researcher in computer vision and/or robotics with a Master degree in Engineering Science, Applied Sciences, Civil Engineering, Physics, Computer Science or Mathematics.

We value diversity and equal opportunities. We firmly believe that diversity enriches our community, and we encourage all qualified candidates to apply.




PROJECT:

You will work within the 4D Perception Lab (https://4dpl.rma.ac.be/) of the department of Mathematics within the Faculty of Polytechnics of the RMA and in close collaboration with military and humanitarian demining agencies. You will conduct scientific research at university level on a project entitled ‘DREAM’.

The DREAM project aims to develop a robust system of multiple unmanned ground robots to discover and map unknown, potentially dangerous environments, controlled from a VR setting. Imagine navigating and securing environments like the damaged Zaventem airport during the 2016 attacks. Our goal is to integrate robot platforms, robotic arms, and VR technology into a cohesive system that ensures accurate, efficient, and user-friendly shared situational awareness. This multi-agent system will enhance redundancy, mapping speed, and maneuverability in real-world conditions.

MAIN TASKS:

Development of algorithms for 3D localization and mapping of the environment using UGV-based sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) devices, inertial measurement units (IMUs) and cameras. These algorithms will be based on methods for sensor fusion (filtering and optimization), machine learning (ML), neural radiance fields (NeRFs), Gaussian splatting (GS), etc.
Organisation of measurement campaigns
Writing scientific papers




SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:

Degree(s) required: Master Degree in Engineering Science, Applied Sciences, Civil Engineering, Physics, Computer Science or Mathematics.

This position is open for junior profiles (ideally 0-3 years of experience) in computer vision and/or robotics.

The possibility to start a PhD related to the project will be offered.

“MUST HAVE” skills:

Training or experience in 3D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), state estimation, 3D computer vision or related fields.
Solid understanding of the theoretical foundations of SLAM, state estimation, and related fields.
Experience in programming with C++ or Python and ROS2 in a Linux environment.
Ability to quickly understand and navigate complex systems and established code bases.
Experience with electro-optical data processing.




“NICE TO HAVE” skills:

Training or experience in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning.
Experience with 3D visualization frameworks such as Rerun, Three.js, WebGL.
Experience with OpenCV, PyTorch or Tensorflow




Personal skills:

You conduct scientific research in an independent and upright way within a multidisciplinary environment and communicate your results in a clear, concise and precise manner.
You take initiative, solve problems autonomously and find alternatives or solutions.
You are flexible for change and adapt yourself.
You commit yourself in your job by giving the best of your aptitudes in striving toward the highest quality standards and persevere when needed.
You will be working very closely together with the industrial partner and will get insight in their proprietary intellectual property. Confidentiality is therefore an absolute must.

Other skills:

The applicant shall have good knowledge of English (oral / written).
Minimum knowledge of French or Dutch is an added value for collaboration with peers.
A driver’s licence (but not necessarily a car) is highly recommended




Specific Requirements

The researcher may be exposed to classified information and will therefore have to obtain the required security clearance. The candidate must consent with the background check required to obtain this clearance, which will be executed by Belgian Defense.
Only applicants with a nationality of a country that is both part of NATO and the EU will be eligible.
Working for the Patrimony requires living in Belgium for the duration of the study.

Demonstrated interest in delivering AI-powered features that serve real users at scale (e.g., retrieval-augmented search, Generative AI assistants, predictive analytics).
Fluency in Python or at least one strongly-typed language (TypeScript or Java), with clean-code and testing discipline.
Understanding of cloud-native architectures (AWS or comparable), containerisation (Docker), and orchestration (Kubernetes / ECS).
Hands-on experience with MLOps: reproducible pipelines, automated evaluations, feature stores, CI/CD for models or prompt/embedding configs.
Strong data intuition: ability to inspect raw logs, design metrics, and quickly identify quality regressions.
Product mindset and empathy for end-users; able to translate fuzzy product requirements into incremental engineering plans.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills in English (spoken & written).

Join the mission to make communications trustworthy in the age of AI




About Us:




Aurigin.ai is a Zurich-born startup on a mission to restore trust in digital communication by protecting high stakes organizations from AI-generated voice fraud in real-time. Banks, Government agencies, and enterprises use our deepfake-detection to stop account take-overs, CEO impersonations and fake news before they cause damage.

We're a team of passionate innovators, coming from top tier tech and consulting firms as well as startups. We thrive on collaboration, embrace a ""move fast to launch and iterate"" mentality, and are united by a shared vision of a safer, more transparent world in the age of AI.




Why we need you: 




Our real-time deepfake-detection engine is already used by first high-stakes clients, and we’re now accelerating its reach and capabilities. That leap demands a data scientist who can turn terabytes of noisy, real-world audio into fast, reliable deepfake defenses. Your skill in building robust pipelines, experimenting with state-of-the-art models, and translating research into production will keep us ahead of increasingly sophisticated voice fraud. That’s how we can make the world a safer place for banks, governments, and millions of people who rely on trusted communication.




What you will do:




Handle audio data at scale: Design and implement robust data pipelines and feature-extraction modules for large-scale audio datasets
Bring models to life: Prototype, evaluate, and iterate on machine learning models for deepfake detection and language-related tasks
Turn noise into knowledge: Apply data-wrangling and feature-engineering techniques to transform raw audio into ML-ready formats
Measure what matters: Define performance metrics, design experiments, tune hyperparameters, and validate models using rigorous statistical methods
Stay ahead of the curve: Keep up with the latest AI trends and technologies.




About you:




Experience: 2-5 years in data science or machine learning, with a focus on audio signal processing
Technical proficiency: Python, PyTorch, and Hugging Face tools, with familiarity in audio processing libraries (e.g., librosa, torchaudio)
Sound expertise: Strong grasp of audio engineering principles and best practices in feature engineering
Ownership mindset: Self-driven, love solving complex problems, and can run projects end-to-end in a fast-paced startup world.
Be a good human: Contribute to a positive and fun team environment.
Languages: Fluent in English. Any other language is a plus.




Nice-to-have:




Experience with Hugging Face audio models, including fine-tuning for classification or sequence modeling
Knowledge of audio deepfake detection, voice conversion, or speech synthesis
Contributions to open-source ML/audio projects
Real-time audio or streaming data experience




Benefits:




Make a real impact: Join a company that is working with cutting-edge AI technologies and fighting the good fight.
Be part of something big: Help protect the world from AI-generated chaos and shape our product and culture from the beginning.
Work with cool people: Our team is smart, passionate, and driven.
Flexibility: Work from wherever you're most productive and collaborative. (At least two days a week in the office in Zurich)
Competitive salary and sharing the value you help create: We're offering a meaningful ownership stake in the company. CHF ~80k salary + ~CHF 20k in stock options (depending on role and experience)




If you're ready to use your skills for good and want to be part of a team from the start that's making a real difference, we want to hear from you!

You will be working in a team of talented and driven engineers and scientists, who are striving to make a difference in drug development and open to applying novel techniques in order to contribute to our understanding of some of the most relevant areas of protein science.




The role mainly involves:




Design novel ML/AI algorithms for small-molecule tasks e.g., property prediction, binding-affinity estimation, activity cliffs, ADME/Tox, and generative molecule design.
Integrate physics-based methods with data-driven models to build hybrid, end-to-end pipelines.
Build & own our chemistry-focused MLOps stack, taking models from research to robust production services.
Explore blue-sky research directions while balancing near-term program needs.
Collaborate closely with medicinal chemists and biologists, translating model insights into tangible design hypotheses and experimental campaigns.
Communicate results to technical and non-technical stakeholders papers, internal seminars, open-source contributions, and conference talks.




Education & Experience:




PhD (or MS + 2 yrs experience) in Computer Science, Computational Chemistry, Cheminformatics, Chemical Engineering, Applied Physics, or a related field.
Publications, patents, open-source repos, or shipped products demonstrating impact in AI-for-chemistry or computational drug discovery are highly valued.




The role could be either based in Switzerland, the UK or the US.

You will work at the intersection of sequence-based and structure-based protein modeling, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning and cloud computing to advance antibody and TCR discovery.


Tasks



Technical Leadership: Lead the design and implementation of ML-driven protein modeling projects, including rapid prototyping of novel algorithms for biological sequence and structure analysis. You will plan and execute experiments with state-of-the-art models to push the boundaries of protein function prediction and design.


Protein Design & Analysis: Develop and apply machine learning methods to predict protein function from sequence and structure, and to design novel proteins (especially antibodies and TCRs) with desired properties. This includes projects focused on protein structure prediction, antibody-antigen interaction modeling, affinity maturation, epitope/paratope analysis, and assessing developability and immunogenicity of engineered proteins.


Data Integration & Pipeline Development: Oversee the curation and integration of large-scale sequence and structural datasets (internal and public) to train and validate models. Ensure robust data pipelines and collaborate with software engineers to maintain high-quality, reproducible analysis workflows, from data preprocessing to model deployment.


Collaborative Research: Work closely with automation and wet-lab scientists in iterative design-build-test cycles. Guide the design of antibodies/TCRs for experimental testing, incorporate experimental feedback into model refinement, and integrate AI/ML approaches into existing antibody engineering workflows. Collaborate with cross-functional teams (e.g. protein engineers, bioinformaticians) to translate computational predictions into real-world therapeutics.


Team Management and Mentoring: Supervise and mentor a small team of junior scientists or engineers. Provide technical guidance, code reviews, and support career development. Foster a collaborative team culture where unblocking colleagues and knowledge sharing are prioritized. Coordinate team efforts and ensure timely delivery of project milestones.


Communication and Reporting: Communicate progress, results, and recommendations clearly to stakeholders. This includes writing reports and presenting findings in group meetings, seminars, or external conferences. As a lead scientist, you will also interface with institute leadership to align on project goals and contribute to strategic decisions for the group.

DATA SCIENTIST – GENERATIVE AI SPECIALIST

Entra nel nostro mondo.

Trasforma insieme a noi.

Quale sarà la tua sfida?

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere.

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 6 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus.

Il/La Generative AI Specialist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze nei modelli di Generative AI, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in soluzioni e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi.

I/Le nostri/e Generative AI Specialists verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove per la maggior parte i dati sono non strutturati (testi, immagini, video, suoni) e il cui focus diventa la comprensione, il processamento e la generazione partendo da tali basi documentali altrimenti non processabili con le classiche tecniche di Data Science.

I contesti progettuali spaziano dall’utilizzo di modelli pre-addestrati (es. LLM) fino all’addestramento di nuovi modelli di Generative AI passando dal fine-tuning e absorption learning da modelli commerciali.

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Generative AI Specialist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.
