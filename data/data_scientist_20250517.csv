You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments

🌟 Your Impact at Lila

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

🛠️ What You'll Be Building


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


🧰 What You’ll Need To Succeed


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


🌈 We’re All In

Lila Sciences is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

This will save significant time for mining, hand labeling ground truth, and production of 3D models for sim. In addition, a different project development requires close-loop sensor simulation. Right now, we don’t have internal resources to develop these two key technology capabilities and need a contractor to move forward the algorithm development for these two capabilities.

Qualifications


Minimum MS in Computer Science or a related field, PhD preferred
At least 5+ years of industry experience
Proficient in Pytorch coding for ML modeling, training and eval
Expert knowledge and algorithm experiences in 3DGS and/or NeRF, 3D Reconstruction and Novel View Synthesis

Support pricing and limit-setting strategies through quantitative analysis of risk-adjusted returns.
Design and evaluate tests to policy changes to measure the impact of credit risk strategies on financial performance.


Requirements


Master’s degree or Ph.D. in Statistics, Economics, Finance, Computer Science, or a related quantitative field.
3+ years of experience in credit risk analytics, underwriting strategy, or related data science roles in lending or financial services.
Strong experience with SQL and Python (or R) for data analysis and modeling.
Proficiency in credit risk modeling techniques, including logistic regression, scorecard development, and loss forecasting.
Familiarity with credit bureau data, alternative data sources, and regulatory risk considerations.
Ability to synthesize complex analyses into actionable business insights and communicate findings to stakeholders.

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market. In compliance with pay transparency laws and in pursuit of pay equity and fairness, we publish salary ranges for our open roles. On top of base salary, we also offer equity, generous perks and comprehensive benefits.

Lila Sciences is the world’s first scientific superintelligence platform and autonomous lab for life, chemistry, and materials science.  We are pioneering a new age of boundless discovery by building the capabilities to apply AI to every aspect of the scientific method.  We are introducing scientific superintelligence to solve humankind's greatest challenges, enabling scientists to bring forth solutions in human health, climate, and sustainability at a pace and scale never experienced before. Learn more about this mission at  www.lila.ai  

At Lila, we are uniquely cross-functional and collaborative. We are actively reimagining the way teams work together and communicate. Therefore, we seek individuals with an inclusive mindset and a diversity of thought. Our teams thrive in unstructured and creative environments. All voices are heard because we know that experience comes in many forms, skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

🌟 Your Impact at Lila

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

🛠️ What You'll Be Building


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


🧰 What You’ll Need To Succeed


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


🌈 We’re All In

Lila Sciences is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

🤝 A Note to Agencies

Lila Sciences does not accept unsolicited resumes from any source other than candidates. The submission of unsolicited resumes by recruitment or staffing agencies to Lila Sciences or its employees is strictly prohibited unless contacted directly by Lila Science’s internal Talent Acquisition team. Any resume submitted by an agency in the absence of a signed agreement will automatically become the property of Lila Sciences, and Lila Sciences will not owe any referral or other fees with respect thereto.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments

Zillow Group’s mission is to help more people get home. We're currently seeking a Data Scientist to join the Partner Analytics team! We’re passionate about understanding the customer journey on our platforms through meticulous analysis and measurement. We strive to ensure that agents have the tools and information needed to support the home-buying journey.

The team works closely with the senior leaders, the product organization, and other data science teams to discover strategic opportunities in areas spanning Partner performance, including monthly business reviews, data pipelines development, and performance modeling for Zillow’s Flex and Market-Based Pricing lead programs. We have a flat team structure, and you will soon find yourself communicating directly with Senior Leadership.

About The Role

In this role, you’ll work closely with Zillow's Premier Agent product teams to discover deep insights about the agent performance funnels through experiments and advanced analytics, and use this data to influence business strategy and build product roadmaps. More specifically, this role will:


Design and implement A/B Tests, read test results, and provide recommendations to the business roadmap
Apply advanced analytics, including hierarchical Bayesian, clustering, propensity modeling, and other explanatory and causal inference techniques to gain a clearer picture of operator behavior
Collaborate with internal operations and engineering teams to discuss problems, design an analytics framework, pull in the most relevant data for the business, and develop solutions
Proactively identify areas of opportunity in the Premier Agent business and operational processes to drive improvements in business metrics, cross-sell revenue, and operational efficiency


This role has been categorized as a teleworker position. Teleworkers do not have a permanent corporate office workplace and, instead, work from a physical location of their choice which must be identified to the Company. Employees may live in any part of Mexico, but preferably in Mexico City, as we would encourage attendance for occasional in-office events.

In addition to a competitive base salary and benefits, this position is also eligible for equity awards based on factors such as experience, performance and location.

Who you are

You are a curious and passionate problem-solver who will not shy away from complexity or uncertainty! Come join us and use your expertise to help us find opportunities and guide our business into the future with powerful insights and recommendations.

We're searching for a Data Scientist who has:


An undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g., science, engineering, economics, quantitative finance, operations research, statistics, or similar) or relevant experience within data science.
3+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and sophisticated problem solving
A strong understanding of statistical concepts, measurement issues, and inference techniques
Proficiency in SQL, Excel, and either Python or R, along with some experience with Tableau, Mode, or other visualization software
Superb verbal and written communication skills with the ability to distill complex issues and detailed analysis into simple, structured frameworks with concrete action plans
Able to work cross-functionally and influence business partners to set realistic goals and focus on data-driven solutions

Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We build, power, and evolve the tools and technologies that connect millions of entrepreneurs with millions of buyers around the world. As an Etsy Inc. employee, whether a team member of Etsy, Reverb, or Depop, you will tackle unique, meaningful, and large-scale problems alongside passionate coworkers, all the while making a rewarding impact and Keeping Commerce Human.

Salary Range

$136,000.00 - $176,000.00

What’s the role?

We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join our Inventory team! This team’s responsible for tackling one of Etsy’s evergreen problems: how to optimize our customers’ interaction with Etsy’s impressive catalog of 120M+ unique items with workstreams to help buyers make confident purchasing decisions, give sellers flexibility to better describe their items, and shape experiences in key categories to drive discovery. As the Senior Data Scientist on this team, you will be working closely with both the Machine Learning and Customer Experience teams, applying sophisticated analytical techniques to break down high-level strategy questions into actionable insights. You will also play a critical role in conducting and evaluating experiments to drive decision-making about products and features.

This is a full-time position reporting to the Senior Manager, Product Analytics. In addition to salary, you will also be eligible for an equity package, an annual performance bonus, and our competitive benefits that support you and your family as part of your total rewards package at Etsy.

This role requires your presence in Etsy’s Brooklyn Office once or twice per week depending on your proximity to the office. Candidates living within commutable distance of Etsy’s Brooklyn Office Hub may be the first to be considered. Learn more details about our work modes and workplace safety policies here.

What’s this team like at Etsy?


This role is a part of the Product Analytics team, which uses rigorous methods to generate insights that inform product, ML, engineering, and business decisions across the company. We collaborate with partner teams through all stages of development: actively uncovering opportunity areas, crafting experiments to test hypotheses, analyzing the impact of our efforts, and highlighting takeaways.
Learning new skills and techniques is not only a requirement but a perk of the job! We are always looking for opportunities to grow. Our mission is to guide our partner teams with data and insights and tell the story of how we attract and retain our users – to teams, to senior management, and to the community.


What does the day-to-day look like?


Partner and work collaboratively with the cross-functional Inventory Quality team.
Play a meaningful role in finding opportunities to further improve buyer experiences and driving decision-making with your partners.
Design and analyze rigorous experiments, help teams set great hypotheses, and deliver robust analysis of experiment results.
Transform raw data into meaningful and impactful analysis characterized by strong data governance, technique transparency, and clear documentation.
Design and define metrics to ensure robust measurement of product performance.
Build foundational data sets using SQL and database skills.
Craft outstanding dashboards and visualizations using Looker, as well as impactful presentations for senior leaders.
Possess a deep level of curiosity and appetite for learning, which drives you to finding outstanding solutions.
Of course, this is just a sample of the kinds of work this role will require! You should assume that your role will encompass other tasks, too, and that your job duties and responsibilities may change from time to time at Etsy's discretion, or otherwise applicable with local law.


Qualities that will help you thrive in this role are:


4+ years experience as a data scientist or data analyst in which you have independently extracted meaning from big data sets with little engineering support.
Successful track record of guiding product teams to identify high-impact opportunities, set meaningful goals against key outcomes, and make data-driven decisions. Experience working in a two sided Marketplaces environment and/or with machine learning preferred.
Mastery of SQL and proficiency in R/Python. Passionate to try new approaches to advance your technical skills.
Deep understanding of experimentation theory and practical experience designing and analyzing online experiments.
Specialize in sophisticated analyses and regularly use statistical methods in your work.
Proficiency with Looker, Tableau, or other data visualization software.
Distill highly complex problems into narratives that are concise, actionable, and memorable, and express your recommendations with both conviction and finesse.

--

A global energy infrastructure company is seeking a highly skilled Data Scientist to design, build, and deploy machine learning and optimization models in a distributed computing environment. This role involves full lifecycle model development—from data preparation to deployment—and requires a strong foundation in data engineering, Python programming, and Spark (PySpark).

You’ll work in close partnership with technical and business stakeholders to ensure that data solutions provide measurable impact. This is an onsite role based in Arlington, VA, reporting to the Director of Business Intelligence, and embedded within the organization’s enterprise applications team.




Key Responsibilities:

Own and execute end-to-end data science workflows, from requirements gathering to model deployment and evaluation.
Transform, clean, and join large datasets to make them suitable for modeling—no data, no model.
Build, test, and deploy machine learning, simulation, and optimization models that drive real business value.
Deliver production-ready code that is modular, scalable, and minimizes technical debt.
Engage with subject matter experts to understand and solve targeted operational or strategic problems.
Contribute to the design of automated data science pipelines and continuous improvement of infrastructure.




Qualifications:

Required:

Bachelor's degree in a quantitative or technical field and 2+ years of experience, or a Master’s in Data Science or related discipline.
Proficiency in Python and deep familiarity with one or more data manipulation libraries (e.g., Pandas, Polars, Spark).
Experience preparing data for modeling: including ingestion, cleansing, transformation, aggregation, and profiling.
Ability to work autonomously, communicate technical concepts clearly, and manage multiple tasks in a fast-paced setting.




Preferred:

Hands-on expertise in Spark (PySpark) using the Spark SQL API (not Pandas-on-Spark).
Ability to build data visualizations using libraries like Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Altair, etc.
Familiarity with functional programming paradigms, unit testing, and software engineering best practices.
Experience with simulation modeling (e.g., system dynamics, agent-based modeling, or discrete event simulation).
Exposure to distributed ML/DL libraries (e.g., SparkML, PyTorch).
Familiarity with open-source Python optimization frameworks.

About Smule

At Smule, we don’t just build apps—we build connections through music. Join a team where your work will inspire millions to create and collaborate. Be part of a global movement that turns musical dreams into reality

About The Role

We're looking for a Data Scientist to help take our product and analytics capabilities to the next level. You'll join a lean, cross-functional data team where you'll work across the full stack, from deep user analysis, KPI development, and A/B testing to building ranking models that power personalized user experiences.

Our team includes experienced ML and BI Engineers and Analysts, and reports directly to the Director of Data. We're collaborative, fast-moving, and deeply connected to the product: we're responsible for everything from executive reporting to developing machine learning models that improve user engagement and satisfaction. You'll operate across this full stack, supporting product discovery through deep user and business analysis, helping define and test success through experimentation, and building embedding-based retrieval, re-ranking, and recommendation systems.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives at the intersection of data science, product thinking, and engineering: someone who is excited to drive impact from prototype to production.

Product & Experimentation Support


Work closely with Product to define success metrics, analyze user behavior, drive A/B tests and interpret their results.
Contribute to the design of controlled experiments, including power analysis, segmentation, and instrumentation planning.
Partner with PMs in an assigned squad to monitor KPI health post-release and continuously iterate on the product with a bias for impact.
Maintain (or occasionally build) Tableau dashboards and internal metric frameworks that help teams inform their decisions.


Search & Recommendation Systems


Work alongside ML Engineers to move promising prototypes into production, contributing features, evaluation logic, and model tuning strategies.
Help design and iterate on a hybrid retrieval-reranking pipeline, combining lexical scoring (e.g. BM25) with embedding-based similarity (semantic vectors).
Train and evaluate models that embed user queries and catalog items into a shared vector space using tools like SBERT, CLAP, or custom transformer heads.
Contribute to ANN-based retrieval (e.g. FAISS, HNSW in Elasticsearch) and deep re-ranking models that improve content relevance and personalization.
Collaborate with ML Engineers to maintain and improve existing recommendation systems


Modeling & Personalization


Develop models for user segmentation, content affinity, churn prediction, and lifecycle modeling — using statistical or ML approaches as appropriate.
Partner with ML Engineers to validate offline performance, manage feature versioning, and test production models through staged rollout or shadow deployment.
Investigate and prototype embedding-based re-rankers, user profile vectors, and intent prediction models to increase downstream engagement.


Data Infrastructure & Collaboration


Partner with BI Engineers to improve our analytics layer (Airflow, dbt), enhance schema design, and automate recurring data quality checks.
Write modular, maintainable code in Python for analysis, modeling, and batch/real-time inference tasks.
Contribute to shared libraries or internal packages for metrics, feature engineering, or evaluation logic.


About You


3+ years experience in a data science, applied ML, or product analytics role
Bachelor’s degree in statistics, mathematics, computer science, or related field (Master’s or PhD preferred)
Understanding of experiment design, including segmentation, causal inference, or uplift modeling
Strong communication skills and ability to work with stakeholders across engineering, product, and executive functions
Strong SQL and Python skills — you’re comfortable writing complex joins, CTEs, and analytical functions in SQL, and working with Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and PyTorch.
Experience with search, recommendations, or retrieval-based ranking systems, including familiarity with:
Lexical vs semantic retrieval tradeoffs
Query/item embeddings
ANN search and vector indexing (e.g. FAISS, HNSW)
Ranker evaluation (MRR, nDCG, recall@k)
A working understanding of how embedding similarity integrates with lexical ranking (e.g., hybrid scoring, reciprocal rank fusion, weighted sum).
Familiar with the modern data stack (Snowflake, dbt, Airflow, Tableau), and capable of working across it to support both analysis and production ML workflows.

Nice to Have


Experience with embedding models like SBERT, CLAP, MuLan, or fine-tuning transformer architectures for domain-specific tasks
Familiarity with model monitoring, version control for ML artifacts, and deployment pipelines
Prior experience with music/audio tech, content platforms, or recommendation-heavy consumer products


Why This Role?


Real Impact: You’ll work on features directly tied to user experience and platform growth, including smarter discovery, personalization, and lifecycle touchpoints.
Technical Breadth: From dashboards to deployed ranking models, you’ll touch the full stack of data work in a fast-paced, creative environment.
Growth Opportunity: You’ll be supported by the Director of Data and have the freedom to grow your role toward product analytics, engineering, or modeling specialization, based on your strengths and interests.


Why Smule?


Collaborate with a global team passionate about music and innovation.
Work on exciting projects that shape how millions connect and create.
Be part of a company that values creativity, curiosity, and impact.


Ready to turn data into harmony? Apply today and let’s make music together!

Zillow Group’s mission is to help more people get home. We're currently seeking a Data Scientist to join the Partner Analytics team! We’re passionate about understanding the customer journey on our platforms through meticulous analysis and measurement. We strive to ensure that agents have the tools and information needed to support the home-buying journey.

The team works closely with the senior leaders, the product organization, and other data science teams to discover strategic opportunities in areas spanning Partner performance, including monthly business reviews, data pipelines development, and performance modeling for Zillow’s Flex and Market-Based Pricing lead programs. We have a flat team structure, and you will soon find yourself communicating directly with Senior Leadership.

About The Role

In this role, you’ll work closely with Zillow's Premier Agent product teams to discover deep insights about the agent performance funnels through experiments and advanced analytics, and use this data to influence business strategy and build product roadmaps. More specifically, this role will:


Design and implement A/B Tests, read test results, and provide recommendations to the business roadmap
Apply advanced analytics, including hierarchical Bayesian, clustering, propensity modeling, and other explanatory and causal inference techniques to gain a clearer picture of operator behavior
Collaborate with internal operations and engineering teams to discuss problems, design an analytics framework, pull in the most relevant data for the business, and develop solutions
Proactively identify areas of opportunity in the Premier Agent business and operational processes to drive improvements in business metrics, cross-sell revenue, and operational efficiency


This role has been categorized as a teleworker position. Teleworkers do not have a permanent corporate office workplace and, instead, work from a physical location of their choice which must be identified to the Company. Employees may live in any part of Mexico, but preferably in Mexico City, as we would encourage attendance for occasional in-office events.

In addition to a competitive base salary and benefits, this position is also eligible for equity awards based on factors such as experience, performance and location.

Who you are

You are a curious and passionate problem-solver who will not shy away from complexity or uncertainty! Come join us and use your expertise to help us find opportunities and guide our business into the future with powerful insights and recommendations.

We're searching for a Data Scientist who has:


An undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g., science, engineering, economics, quantitative finance, operations research, statistics, or similar) or relevant experience within data science.
3+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and sophisticated problem solving
A strong understanding of statistical concepts, measurement issues, and inference techniques
Proficiency in SQL, Excel, and either Python or R, along with some experience with Tableau, Mode, or other visualization software
Superb verbal and written communication skills with the ability to distill complex issues and detailed analysis into simple, structured frameworks with concrete action plans
Able to work cross-functionally and influence business partners to set realistic goals and focus on data-driven solutions

We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

Over the past few months, and with a founding team consisting of Julien, second time founder with a PhD in materials science, and Katie, former experienced operator within the climate tech space, we have raised our first round of funding from leading investors, secured several letters of intent and demonstrated that we have a way of boosting the world's production of recycled copper.

We have developed a new wire-forming technology that produces high-conductivity copper wire without the need for 99.95% pure copper raw materials. No smelting. No refining. Just a smarter process.




By eliminating these costly and highly polluting steps, we are considerably reducing the overall cost of copper wire production, while making use of millions of tonnes of copper scrap currently unsuitable for electrical use. Our technology paves the way for fully circular and cost-effective copper wire production, making it an essential part of the global energy transition.

We’re now building our core team, and it’s the perfect time to jump on board.




About the role

We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in deep learning for predictive process control, to help us model and optimize our novel mechanical and thermal wire forming process.




You’ll take the lead on developing a model-based controller capable of anticipating system behavior and driving performance improvements in real-time. Your work will sit at the intersection of physical process modeling, data-driven algorithms, and real-world industrial systems.




Contract: CDI (permanent)
Location: Nanterre (hybrid)
Language: English fluency required. French is a plus but not required.




Your responsibilities

Develop and deploy predictive control algorithms to optimize mechanical and thermal processes for wire forming
Build hybrid models using deep learning and physics-based insights, incorporating process data and literature-based proxies
Design and implement efficient data collection pipelines from characterization methods to support model training and validation, to gather an optimized dataset
Simulate process dynamics, stress-test control logic, and run live tests on physical prototypes
Ensure the system is robust to uncertainties and ready for industrial scale-up




Ideal background

Engineering degree, MSc or PhD in Machine Learning, Control Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Material Science or related field
Strong hands on experience in model-based controlling and reinforcement learning for process control/material characterization
Proven track record applying deep learning to real-world physical systems
Proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, C++)
Familiarity with simulation tools (e.g., Abaqus, Ansys, Simulink, Modelica, or custom simulation environments)
Bonus: Experience working with manufacturing systems or industrial process control
Bonus: Demonstrated initiative in building and experimenting, whether through side projects, small-scale physical prototypes, or hands-on tinkering in a garage or lab




What we offer

We’re building a world-class industrial deep tech company, and we’re doing it from the ground up. You’ll be one of the earliest team members, shaping not only the tech, but the culture, direction, and impact of our start-up.




CDI contract
Competitive compensation + BSPCE package
50% health insurance coverage
Hybrid work model (office in Nanterre)




We believe deep tech needs deep diversity. We’re committed to building an inclusive, impact-driven team, and if you’re excited by our mission but don’t tick every box, we’d still love to hear from you. We value versatility and the ability to learn, which is absolutely essential at this stage of our business.




Let’s build the future of circular copper, together.

What’s more meaningful than seeing the real-world impact of your work?




Ok, maybe ending world hunger, but this is a strong second.

At OOONO, you’re not just building models in a notebook. You’re shaping the algorithms that directly power a physical product - used in real time by real people in the real world.

Join a small, collaborative team where you’re trusted to take ownership, test bold ideas, and push things into production. You’ll work hands-on with rich geospatial data to make our location logic smarter and faster.

And you’ll do it side by side with engineers, hardware specialists, and designers who genuinely care - about the product, the users, and each other.

What you’ll be doing

Develop and improve core algorithms to enhance product performance and user experience.
Contribute to map matching logic and road network analysis to improve location accuracy
Design, build, and maintain predictive models to solve complex business challenges.
Analyze large-scale data sets from Athena, MongoDB, and other sources to extract actionable insights.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Software, Hardware, UX/UI) to implement data-driven solutions.
Experiment with cutting-edge geospatial tools and frameworks to continuously improve analytical workflows.
Handle location data and geo spatial field.




We imagine you’re someone who has

A master’s degree in data science, geoinformatics or similar field
Proven experience (3+ years) in a Data Science role or similar, ideally within a tech environment and working with geospatial data
Proficiency in Python, including libraries such as Polars, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, Pyproj, Folium, Osmnx
Knowledge of geospatial analysis techniques (e.g., spatial joins, indexing, projections).
Strong understanding of statistical analysis, machine learning, and algorithm development.
Solid problem-solving skills and ability to work independently when needed
Hands-on person that can drive processes from A to B independently
English is a requirement.
Self-driven




How is it working at OOONO?

We’re glad we asked. It’s a nice working place. As in nice-nice. We have a relaxed, informal atmosphere and a flat hierarchy. Whenever you need a break from your important work stuff, you can get beat in table tennis, foosball, or just smalltalk about the weather by the coffee machine. We have monthly social events where we do anything from go-karting to going to festivals.

And when we’re not social? Then we’re pretty damn ambitious. We don’t like conservative targets or linear growth. We’re all about the extraordinary. This has led OOONO to become one of the fastest-growing tech scaleups and surprise-surprise: We have no plans of slowing down. So yes, OOONO is a lovely place to work, but it’s also a pretty good opportunity to develop as a person and take the next steps in your career.

Over the past few months, and with a founding team consisting of Julien, second time founder with a PhD in materials science, and Katie, former experienced operator within the climate tech space, we have raised our first round of funding from leading investors, secured several letters of intent and demonstrated that we have a way of boosting the world's production of recycled copper.

We have developed a new wire-forming technology that produces high-conductivity copper wire without the need for 99.95% pure copper raw materials. No smelting. No refining. Just a smarter process.




By eliminating these costly and highly polluting steps, we are considerably reducing the overall cost of copper wire production, while making use of millions of tonnes of copper scrap currently unsuitable for electrical use. Our technology paves the way for fully circular and cost-effective copper wire production, making it an essential part of the global energy transition.

We’re now building our core team, and it’s the perfect time to jump on board.




About the role

We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in deep learning for predictive process control, to help us model and optimize our novel mechanical and thermal wire forming process.




You’ll take the lead on developing a model-based controller capable of anticipating system behavior and driving performance improvements in real-time. Your work will sit at the intersection of physical process modeling, data-driven algorithms, and real-world industrial systems.




Contract: CDI (permanent)
Location: Nanterre (hybrid)
Language: English fluency required. French is a plus but not required.




Your responsibilities

Develop and deploy predictive control algorithms to optimize mechanical and thermal processes for wire forming
Build hybrid models using deep learning and physics-based insights, incorporating process data and literature-based proxies
Design and implement efficient data collection pipelines from characterization methods to support model training and validation, to gather an optimized dataset
Simulate process dynamics, stress-test control logic, and run live tests on physical prototypes
Ensure the system is robust to uncertainties and ready for industrial scale-up




Ideal background

Engineering degree, MSc or PhD in Machine Learning, Control Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Material Science or related field
Strong hands on experience in model-based controlling and reinforcement learning for process control/material characterization
Proven track record applying deep learning to real-world physical systems
Proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, C++)
Familiarity with simulation tools (e.g., Abaqus, Ansys, Simulink, Modelica, or custom simulation environments)
Bonus: Experience working with manufacturing systems or industrial process control
Bonus: Demonstrated initiative in building and experimenting, whether through side projects, small-scale physical prototypes, or hands-on tinkering in a garage or lab




What we offer

We’re building a world-class industrial deep tech company, and we’re doing it from the ground up. You’ll be one of the earliest team members, shaping not only the tech, but the culture, direction, and impact of our start-up.




CDI contract
Competitive compensation + BSPCE package
50% health insurance coverage
Hybrid work model (office in Nanterre)




We believe deep tech needs deep diversity. We’re committed to building an inclusive, impact-driven team, and if you’re excited by our mission but don’t tick every box, we’d still love to hear from you. We value versatility and the ability to learn, which is absolutely essential at this stage of our business.




Let’s build the future of circular copper, together.

Diversity Equity Inclusion Statement

We believe every member of our team and student body deserves opportunities for growth, success and inclusion. We recognize that for many of our students, staff and communities, their life journeys run through oppressive structures and systems (e.g. classism, racism, sexism) — and that’s what makes our organizational culture and work so necessary and important. We believe that diversity in perspective, backgrounds, ethnicities and lived experience is a strength, and from that strength, we can accomplish great things with the students we serve.

Together as students, staff, organizations, communities, volunteers, and partners, we are intentional about creating safe spaces where all members can speak authentically and be themselves.

We are committed to Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity. As members of The Possible Zone community, our progression along this ongoing journey raises thoughtful questions, reveals biases, and opens conversations. We celebrate one another and are unified in our commitment to young people, excellence, and innovation. This work is our shared responsibility and our opportunity to welcome all members who share in our mission and strive to provide pathways that further prepare students in achieving their desired success.
