We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.
Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partners - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com) and Jaksa Marojevic (jaksa.marojevic@external.wolt.com)

Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.

Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.

Develop and implement machine learning models to predict and mitigate fraud and credit risk.
Work closely with engineers, product managers, and business leaders to translate insights into concrete actions that improve our business outcomes.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Merchant Group At Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.
Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partners - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com) and Jaksa Marojevic (jaksa.marojevic@external.wolt.com)

Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

We're building the software infrastructure for the decarbonised energy system, backed by some of the best investors in the world (TechCrunch).

We make the technology to move energy usage to times when electricity is cheap and green. Our software controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries. We use machine learning to figure out what energy people will need, and when they'll need it. We control tens of thousands of energy assets, and we're growing quickly.

Requirements

Read more about what we're building here.

You can expect:


insane amounts of ownership
hard technical challenges
that what you build is commercially and environmentally valuable



In return, we ask for:


the courage to build new things fast
a commitment to real world impact over technical perfection
a desire to help build and lead an exceptional and tight knit team
deep-seated motivation to combat climate change



And it'd be nice if you could bring:


knowledge of the electricity system, specifically power trading
comfort speaking to clients (we're a small team and we all wear many hats)
familiarity with time-series data



You shouldn't apply if:


uncertainty scares you
you aren't prepared to try, fail, and try again
you're looking for a low intensity, low impact role



Interview process


Initial interview
Take-home exercise
Final interview (in-person)
Offer, references, and welcome to the team!


Tech stack

🐍 We do everything in Python, because it allows data scientists and engineers to collaborate closely and move quickly. Our data scientists write lots of production code. We ❤️ Streamlit.

🎨 We try a bunch of things in Figma before we build them in code, because it's a fast and cheap way to get feedback.

🐋 Everything we build lives in Docker, for minimal cross-platform faff and maximal reproducibility.

☁️ We deploy on GCP

Benefits

We love the idea of fully remote work but it doesn't... work. For very early stage companies, people learn faster, get on better, and accomplish more when they're spending a decent chunk of time together. We ask that you spend 2-3 days a week in our London office.

We are extremely keen to build a diverse company, and we're particularly eager to hear from candidates who don't fit the traditional engineering stereotypes. If you're motivated by our mission, please do reach out, even if you feel you might not ‘check all the boxes'.

This is a new position for a Machine Learning Engineer, working primarily at The Royal Marsden but in close collaboration with The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR).

The Royal Marsden, together with its academic partner the ICR, is designated as the UK's only NIHR BRC dedicated solely to cancer.

This post is suitable for an engineer or scientist with the desire to apply machine and deep learning methodology to real-world clinical problems. The Machine Learning Engineer will be working on a programme whose aims are to evaluate and help develop state-of-the-art AI algorithms using a dedicated machine learning operations (MLOps) platform. Algorithms that pass the evaluation will be used by clinicians managing the treatment of cancer patients, and by scientists developing and evaluating novel therapies.

The Successful Post Holder Will Be An Active Member And Will Be Supported By Team Members And Infrastructure Within The AI Imaging Hub

Leadership. The Hub is led by 2 co-directors and managed by a transformation lead.

Multidisciplinary manpower. The hub hosts data scientists, informaticians, research radiographers and radiographer AI champions, radiologist AI champions, clinical trial managers and coordinators; imaging scientists and students. We work closely with key partners such as the clinical MRI research group, Integrated Pathology Unit, Biomedical Research Informatics Digital Environment (BRIDgE) teams and Data Stewards Group.

Data access and organisation. Our in-house expertise has created an image repository – XNAT - which has now been adopted by the 7 CRUK NCITA sites as the data repository platform of choice. The hub team will maintain and expand the capabilities of XNAT, which is the backbone data management system for our imaging AI and radiomics pipelines and has provided crucial leverage in securing competitive funding. We have recently set up a machine learning operations (MLOps) platform to evaluate AI algorithms, either developed in house or brought in by a third party, in a real-world clinical environment.

The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust is a world-leading cancer centre. Our role is to offer our patients the best cancer care available anywhere in the world, and to continue to make a global contribution to finding better ways of diagnosing and treating cancer. We employ over 4,500 staff in a diverse range of careers including nursing, medical, science, radiography, pharmacy, occupational therapy, finance and administrative services. We have two hospitals – one in Chelsea, London, and one in Sutton, Surrey – as well as a Medical Daycare Unit in Kingston Hospital.

At The Royal Marsden, we deal with cancer every day, so we understand how valuable life is. When people entrust their lives to us, they have the right to demand the very best. That's why the pursuit of excellence lies at the heart of everything we do.

At the heart of the hospital is our dedicated team. We offer a stimulating and dynamic working environment, a wide range of staff benefits, learning and development opportunities and clear career pathways. There are opportunities to work flexibly across a range of areas and specialities and we welcome flexible working requests from point of hire to support employees work life balance. We are looking for employees who aspire to excellence, share our values and can play a crucial role in our on-going achievements.

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.




Vertex Search is acting as a recruitment agency on this assignment.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)


If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.




Vertex Search is acting as a recruitment agency on this assignment.

Location: London

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Machine Learning Engineer with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

We believe that everyone can have equal and unconstrained access to educational experiences on par with Oxford, Cambridge, CalTech, et cetera. We believe that this can be achieved with a new class of learning tools, which combine advances in cognitive science, language models, and datasets. We are building these tools in England.

Our first product, Grasp Concepts, enables students to disambiguate and learn concepts through great online explanations and is deployed with design partners including Imperial College London. Our second product, Grasp Pathways, decomposes learning goals and suggests flexible learning trajectories to reach them, using reputable learning resources like books and lectures, and is in private alpha. An on-demand, online oxbridge-like experience.

Team and Funding

We've raised significant capital from top tier investors including Balderton Capital, Mozilla (yes, Firefox), and Point9. Our founder Ed built the Payments and Trading products at Revolut alongside his bachelors and masters degrees. He was also one of a handful of investors at DST Global. Our team have backgrounds in elite institutions including Revolut, Huawei, Max-Planck Institute, Oxford, and Cambridge. We're building something so hard we cannot afford to work with anyone but the best.

R&D Engineering at Grasp

This is a system design, prototyping, and development role, with a high degree of individual contribution. The systems you build will involve machine learning, generative AI, and applied maths (e.g. graph algorithm) approaches as you solve problems for online self-directed learners. As an individual contributor, you will be expected to lead projects and take initiative when new problems present themselves. In doing so, you will need to decompose company objectives into clearly defined roadmaps and break these down into near term tasks, splitting these between yourself and others. You will work with all of your colleagues (designers, engineers, founder) on a daily basis and interact with users. The company is flat and collaborative in structure. You should find our mission and the products you build compelling, i.e. you like learning new things in your free time.

Tech

Backend: Python, FastAPI, UV for package management (we have a monorepo), domain driven design, events-based architecture

Frontend: Typescript, React, Bun for package management (monorepo again), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn

Infra: GCP, k8s

Requirements


Extensive work experience involving programming, machine learning, and applied mathematics for R&D projects
8+ years programming and software engineering in industry, including several years working with Python

Innovation is the key to solving society's greatest challenges, and IP (intellectual property) plays a pivotal role in encouraging, driving, and capitalising on innovation.




At Ankar AI, our mission is to empower IP and R&D teams with AI tools to innovate more efficiently, thoroughly, and productively.




We are building a platform for inventors to accelerate their work throughout the entire IP lifecycle by providing them with best in class software, leveraging LLMs, for IP search, patent filing, freedom-to-operate analysis and infringement detection.




With the growing complexity and volume of IP today, traditional software is no longer meeting the needs of inventors. Many companies are turning to us to help them stay at the forefront of innovation by cutting through the noise of the millions of patents filed each year.




We believe we are the right team to tackle this problem.

World class team of engineers and product leaders from Palantir, Amazon, Twitter, BCG, and top startups. Together, we have a proven track record of tackling tough problems and delivering mission-driven software.
We are growing rapidly with increasing customer traction. We are already working with the world's most innovative organisations (Fortune 500 companies and top patent filers) to solve critical needs with our product.
We are backed by Tier 1 VCs and Angel Investors, including Index Ventures, co-founders of Hugging Face, CEO of Datadog, and product experts from DeepMind and OpenAI.




We are now growing the team to reach our ambitions. We hire the best and reward accordingly.

Compensation & Equity: We offer competitive compensation and a generous equity package, making you an owner of the company.
Career Growth: You have the opportunity to shape your role, own the impact, grow with the company, and build your skills to accelerate your career at Ankar and beyond.
Meaningful Work: You will have full ownership in tackling challenging problems and help progress innovation in a world that is more and more faced with stagnation. We were founded in early 2024 and you have a real opportunity to shape what we do here.




What you will be doing




Build a first-class AI-enabled platform in a high-ownership environment, where you’ll be leading development across the backend, ML service, ML infrastructure, and data pipelines.
Fine-tune and deploy large language models for patent search, analysis, drafting, and other intellectual property workflows.
Evaluate and improve large language model outputs for quality, relevance, and accuracy.
Develop and optimise search retrievals and ranking models for large-scale patent and technical literature datasets.
Productionise ML models within AWS, including deployment, monitoring, and integration with backend services.




What we are looking for




Has a track record of building world class software. Ideally you have 3+ years of experience building ML applications.
Thrives in a fast-paced & ambiguous environment. You work quickly and iteratively. We work in one-week sprints to ensure we are delivering value and and leading the market.
Seeks ownership. You own your work, approach problems critically, and take pride in what you build. We believe this is the best way to for you to grow and for the product to succeed. We create the environment to help you thrive as an owner.
Wants to work in-person. At this stage of our company, we believe being in the same space enables better communication, quicker decision-making, and fosters a collaborative culture that empowers us to outpace the competition.
[Bonus points] Has experience deploying production ML applications, working with reranking & fine tuning strategies, and/or building large scale content indexing systems.




We believe in people who are driven by curiosity, willing to learn and able to go the extra mile. Please also reach out if you don't exactly ""check all these boxes"".




What else you might want to know




Location: London (no remote)
Contract: Full-time
Compensation: We pay competitive salaries and will reward you with a substantial equity package under the tax-efficient EMI scheme.
Hiring process: (1) 30min introductory chat, (2) 1hr technical interview, (3) 2hr on-site, and (4) 20min final co-founder meeting. The process can be as fast you want it to be.

Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$193,500 - C$290,300. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements

Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations

Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$142,400 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$193,500 - C$290,300. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We are seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to help build intelligent systems that enhance our permit processing, document understanding, and compliance workflows. You will work on LLM-based models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and AI-driven automation, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to extract, analyze, and structure complex permitting data.


Design, implement, and optimize LLM-powered models for document processing, data extraction, and permit application workflows.
Develop and fine-tune retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines to improve query processing and information retrieval.
Experiment with pre-trained models and fine-tune them for permit-related NLP tasks, such as document classification and entity recognition.
Build scalable machine learning infrastructure, integrating with backend systems to support AI-driven workflows.
Work with large-scale structured and unstructured data to ensure efficient indexing, retrieval, and contextual relevance.
Monitor and improve the performance and scalability of deployed models.
Stay updated with the latest research in LLMs, NLP, retrieval systems, and apply best practices to our AI models.
Collaborate with engineers, product managers, and legal experts to develop AI-native solutions for complex permitting challenges.


🙌 Qualifications & Fit:


3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, ideally in production environments.
Strong understanding of LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face models) and their applications.
Hands-on experience with retrieval systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, FAISS, or vector databases).
Proficiency in Python and common ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
Experience with ML model deployment, monitoring, and scaling in a cloud environment (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work in a fast-paced, high-ownership environment.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Support Experience engineering team builds and improves Stripe’s user support from end to end: how users get help within our products, how they get in touch with us when they have questions, and how our teams use internal tools to answer those questions. We’re accountable for the quality and reliability of this support stack and we use data and firsthand user research to continuously improve it.

Providing great support to users of all sizes is culturally important to everyone at Stripe.

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

At Evident Digital, we’re transforming how dental labs and clinics operate—using smart, scalable AI to power the future of work. Our platform, EviSmart™, streamlines digital workflows across the dental industry. But we’re not here to theorize. We build fast, iterate faster, and launch products that solve real-world problems.




The Role




We’re looking for an AI Specialist who doesn’t just think big—but builds quickly. You’ll be hands-on with designing and fine-tuning AI systems that are multimodal and agentic—combining visual, textual, structured, and 3D data to enhance how people work, not replace them.




This role is perfect for do-ers who want to ship, learn, and evolve systems in production—not just research for research’s sake.




What You’ll Do




Build, fine-tune, and deploy models that understand images, text, 3D models (STL), and tabular data
Support development of agentic AI systems that take action and collaborate with users
Train and experiment with foundational models like CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, Gemini, and open LLMs
Work closely with engineers and product teams to deliver practical, scalable features
Build and maintain robust pipelines for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference
Apply new research in generative AI, LLMs, and multimodal ML—but only if it gets us to production faster




What You Bring




3+ years of hands-on experience in AI/ML, deep learning, or computer vision
Strong Python skills with tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Comfort with transformers, attention mechanisms, and other state-of-the-art architectures
Experience building with multimodal data (e.g. images + text + structured data)
A “get-it-done” mindset—you’re a builder who ships and improves in the wild
Bonus: experience working with 3D models (STL, point clouds) or dental/medical data




Why Join Evident




Work on real problems in healthcare—not hypothetical ones
Join a high-trust, low-ego team that values speed, impact, and ownership
Work from Vancouver’s tech hub with like minded people
Competitive salary, generous vacation, and full health, dental, and wellness benefits
Be part of a company that believes AI should uplift people, not replace them

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!
