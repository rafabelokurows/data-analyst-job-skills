Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at DoorDash. We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

About The Team

Stripe Capital provides access to fast, flexible financing to small-and-medium businesses on Stripe to accelerate their growth, and we lent over $1B in 2024. Businesses use the funds for marketing, team growth, geographic expansion, working capital, new equipment purchases, and much more.

Machine learning is core to Stripe Capital’s business—we use information about businesses from their activity within and outside of Stripe and our models to automatically underwrite uniquely tailored financing offers to their needs, which banks are often unable to do. We are doing so through models with an established performance history, data infrastructure that is Stripe scale, and a strong feedback loop that includes explainability, anomaly detection and a risk portfolio management layer. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer for Stripe Capital, you will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production with the goals of providing financing opportunities to as many users as possible while satisfying financial performance goals. You will work closely with software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and risk managers to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Experience with Deep Learning including the latest architectures such as transformers, test-time compute, reinforcement learning



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

As our Data Scientist for Go-to-Market, you will be a key business partner to our Sales and Revenue Operations team. Your work will be instrumental in shaping our data strategy as we design and implement a best-in-class Go-to-Market motion. From exploring what successful customer accounts look like to creating sales pipeline forecasts, your insights will directly impact business decisions and strategy. Each day will bring new challenges and opportunities to drive meaningful change with data.

What You'll Achieve


You will partner with Revenue Operations and Sales leads, driving forward all data science and analytics work in their functional areas
You will transform complex data into compelling insights, synthesizing them into crisp narratives for senior leadership that drive measurable business change (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
You will build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for critical decision-making, along with self-service tools that empower business partners
You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing sales outreach strategies or building a sales forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for GTM analytics



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Revenue Operations, Finance, Growth, Marketing
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy



Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Sales, Customer Success, Revenue Operations, and/or Finance teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

We are seeking a data scientist with a background in economics to support our work to understand the economic impacts of increasingly powerful AI systems. As a member of our Public Policy and Data Science and Analytics teams, you will play an instrumental role in our company’s mission of building beneficial artificial intelligence by scaling our understanding of how models are being used across industries and economies. You’ll be building and scaling a data driven culture from the ground up, while building a body of work that will help shape public policy. This is a unique role, in a unique company, technology, and moment in history; your work will be critical to informing company and external stakeholders as we deploy frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with public policy leadership and societal impact researchers, as well as engineering and go-to-market leaders to define and measure key company economic metrics, analyze product behavior and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You will bring an economist's mind to your data science work, preparing internal and external reports that will inform how the world should think about AI’s impact on economies. With potential timelines for powerful AI systems as early as 2026, this role demands both technical acumen and strategic foresight. You’ve worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into user behavior data to provide insights to policy leaders and influence the company’s product, strategy, and policy priorities.
Define core economic metrics that measure how AI is being used in the economy. Set goals, build forecasts, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting
Identify and size opportunities to improve our societal impacts research and public policy agenda through your insights and recommendations.
Develop hypotheses on economic impacts of our products, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics.
Working with the policy team, write and publish internal and external reports on the economic impacts of AI that provide unique insights and perspectives on the usage of the technology.
Create data systems that can be responsive to inquiries from external experts and policymakers.
Build a data driven culture from the ground up by establishing foundational data best practices and making data more accessible across the company.


You May Be a Good Fit If You Have


6+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in a data infrastructure or operations context.
3+ years of experience of data analysis at the intersection of economics and industry
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI.
Background in public policy and economics
Expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective.
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress.
Demonstrate analytical capabilities in assessing policy implications of emerging technologies.
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions.
Experience in turning open questions and data into concise and insightful analysis.
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills.
Experience translating technical and data work to non-technical audiences


Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 - $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As an early member of our Data Science and Analytics team, you will play an instrumental role in our company's mission of building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence by driving marketing effectiveness through data-driven insights and analytics. In this unique company, technology, and moment in history, your work will be critical to informing our marketing strategy and optimizing our go-to-market approach as we deploy safe, frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with marketing, product, and commercial teams to define and measure key marketing success metrics, analyze customer acquisition and retention, and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You've worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable marketing analytics systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into marketing performance data to provide insights to marketing leaders and influence the company's marketing strategy
Define core marketing metrics that measure the team's success. Set goals, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting for campaigns and channels
Identify and size opportunities to improve marketing effectiveness, influencing marketing roadmap through your insights and recommendations on audience targeting, channel optimization, and messaging effectiveness
Develop hypotheses on marketing initiatives, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics
Develop a unified view of customer behavior across products through deeper analysis
Build a data-driven marketing culture from the ground up by establishing foundational marketing analytics best practices and making marketing data more accessible across the company


You May Be a Good Fit If You Have


6+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in a marketing or customer acquisition context
3+ years of experience deeply embedding in Marketing teams, turning marketing data into concise and insightful analysis that drives business outcomes
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI
Expertise in Python, SQL, and marketing analytics platforms and visualization tools
Experience with marketing attribution models across a variety of channels (SEO, Paid Search, Social, etc.) and A/B testing frameworks
Familiarity with both B2C and B2B/Enterprise marketing analytics
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions about customer behavior and marketing performance
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills, with ability to translate complex analyses into actionable marketing insights


Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 - $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Zillow Group’s mission is to help more people get home. We're currently seeking a Data Scientist to join the Partner Analytics team! We’re passionate about understanding the customer journey on our platforms through meticulous analysis and measurement. We strive to ensure that agents have the tools and information needed to support the home-buying journey.

The team works closely with the senior leaders, the product organization, and other data science teams to discover strategic opportunities in areas spanning Partner performance, including monthly business reviews, data pipelines development, and performance modeling for Zillow’s Flex and Market-Based Pricing lead programs. We have a flat team structure, and you will soon find yourself communicating directly with Senior Leadership.

About The Role

In this role, you’ll work closely with Zillow's Premier Agent product teams to discover deep insights about the agent performance funnels through experiments and advanced analytics, and use this data to influence business strategy and build product roadmaps. More specifically, this role will:


Design and implement A/B Tests, read test results, and provide recommendations to the business roadmap
Apply advanced analytics, including hierarchical Bayesian, clustering, propensity modeling, and other explanatory and causal inference techniques to gain a clearer picture of operator behavior
Collaborate with internal operations and engineering teams to discuss problems, design an analytics framework, pull in the most relevant data for the business, and develop solutions
Proactively identify areas of opportunity in the Premier Agent business and operational processes to drive improvements in business metrics, cross-sell revenue, and operational efficiency


This role has been categorized as a teleworker position. Teleworkers do not have a permanent corporate office workplace and, instead, work from a physical location of their choice which must be identified to the Company. Employees may live in any part of Mexico, but preferably in Mexico City, as we would encourage attendance for occasional in-office events.

In addition to a competitive base salary and benefits, this position is also eligible for equity awards based on factors such as experience, performance and location.

You are a curious and passionate problem-solver who will not shy away from complexity or uncertainty! Come join us and use your expertise to help us find opportunities and guide our business into the future with powerful insights and recommendations.

3+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and sophisticated problem solving
A strong understanding of statistical concepts, measurement issues, and inference techniques
Proficiency in SQL, Excel, and either Python or R, along with some experience with Tableau, Mode, or other visualization software
Superb verbal and written communication skills with the ability to distill complex issues and detailed analysis into simple, structured frameworks with concrete action plans
Able to work cross-functionally and influence business partners to set realistic goals and focus on data-driven solutions

A global energy infrastructure company is seeking a highly skilled Data Scientist to design, build, and deploy machine learning and optimization models in a distributed computing environment. This role involves full lifecycle model development—from data preparation to deployment—and requires a strong foundation in data engineering, Python programming, and Spark (PySpark).

You’ll work in close partnership with technical and business stakeholders to ensure that data solutions provide measurable impact. This is an onsite role based in Arlington, VA, reporting to the Director of Business Intelligence, and embedded within the organization’s enterprise applications team.




Key Responsibilities:

Own and execute end-to-end data science workflows, from requirements gathering to model deployment and evaluation.
Transform, clean, and join large datasets to make them suitable for modeling—no data, no model.
Build, test, and deploy machine learning, simulation, and optimization models that drive real business value.
Deliver production-ready code that is modular, scalable, and minimizes technical debt.
Engage with subject matter experts to understand and solve targeted operational or strategic problems.
Contribute to the design of automated data science pipelines and continuous improvement of infrastructure.




Qualifications:

Required:

Bachelor's degree in a quantitative or technical field and 2+ years of experience, or a Master’s in Data Science or related discipline.
Proficiency in Python and deep familiarity with one or more data manipulation libraries (e.g., Pandas, Polars, Spark).
Experience preparing data for modeling: including ingestion, cleansing, transformation, aggregation, and profiling.
Ability to work autonomously, communicate technical concepts clearly, and manage multiple tasks in a fast-paced setting.




Preferred:

Hands-on expertise in Spark (PySpark) using the Spark SQL API (not Pandas-on-Spark).
Ability to build data visualizations using libraries like Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Altair, etc.
Familiarity with functional programming paradigms, unit testing, and software engineering best practices.
Experience with simulation modeling (e.g., system dynamics, agent-based modeling, or discrete event simulation).
Exposure to distributed ML/DL libraries (e.g., SparkML, PyTorch).
Familiarity with open-source Python optimization frameworks.

Zillow Group’s mission is to help more people get home. We're currently seeking a Data Scientist to join the Partner Analytics team! We’re passionate about understanding the customer journey on our platforms through meticulous analysis and measurement. We strive to ensure that agents have the tools and information needed to support the home-buying journey.

The team works closely with the senior leaders, the product organization, and other data science teams to discover strategic opportunities in areas spanning Partner performance, including monthly business reviews, data pipelines development, and performance modeling for Zillow’s Flex and Market-Based Pricing lead programs. We have a flat team structure, and you will soon find yourself communicating directly with Senior Leadership.

About The Role

In this role, you’ll work closely with Zillow's Premier Agent product teams to discover deep insights about the agent performance funnels through experiments and advanced analytics, and use this data to influence business strategy and build product roadmaps. More specifically, this role will:


Design and implement A/B Tests, read test results, and provide recommendations to the business roadmap
Apply advanced analytics, including hierarchical Bayesian, clustering, propensity modeling, and other explanatory and causal inference techniques to gain a clearer picture of operator behavior
Collaborate with internal operations and engineering teams to discuss problems, design an analytics framework, pull in the most relevant data for the business, and develop solutions
Proactively identify areas of opportunity in the Premier Agent business and operational processes to drive improvements in business metrics, cross-sell revenue, and operational efficiency


This role has been categorized as a teleworker position. Teleworkers do not have a permanent corporate office workplace and, instead, work from a physical location of their choice which must be identified to the Company. Employees may live in any part of Mexico, but preferably in Mexico City, as we would encourage attendance for occasional in-office events.

In addition to a competitive base salary and benefits, this position is also eligible for equity awards based on factors such as experience, performance and location.

Who you are

You are a curious and passionate problem-solver who will not shy away from complexity or uncertainty! Come join us and use your expertise to help us find opportunities and guide our business into the future with powerful insights and recommendations.

We're searching for a Data Scientist who has:


An undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g., science, engineering, economics, quantitative finance, operations research, statistics, or similar) or relevant experience within data science.
3+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and sophisticated problem solving
A strong understanding of statistical concepts, measurement issues, and inference techniques
Proficiency in SQL, Excel, and either Python or R, along with some experience with Tableau, Mode, or other visualization software
Superb verbal and written communication skills with the ability to distill complex issues and detailed analysis into simple, structured frameworks with concrete action plans
Able to work cross-functionally and influence business partners to set realistic goals and focus on data-driven solutions

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

At Netflix, our mission is to connect global stories with audiences worldwide. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story or a game that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.

Beyond connecting global stories with existing audiences, we also aim to reach new subscribers and increase engagement through innovative marketing campaigns. By crafting compelling and targeted marketing strategies, we strive to capture the attention of potential members and convert their interest into subscriptions. Additionally, we focus on increasing conversation and excitement about Netflix and our content, creating buzz and anticipation that encourages both current and prospective members to explore and engage with our diverse offerings.

Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order; however, the Promo Media Algo team, with assistance from creative supervision and member feedback data, have built tools & processes that use technologies like Computer Vision, and Machine Learning to enable our creators to tell the best version of the story they want while allowing our studio to scale further.

Join us to be part of a team that is shaping the future of media and marketing at Netflix. We are seeking an experienced Machine Learning Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience to join our team. You will work closely with our ML scientists to design and develop scalable systems and workflows that enable the efficient development, deployment, and operation of ML/CV algorithms across Netflix's Promo Media and Marketing workflows. This role supports a diverse portfolio of projects - from batch Computer Vision pipelines processing every video package ingested to Netflix, to real-time GenAI systems serving creative workflows - requiring versatility and expertise across different ML deployment paradigms.

Responsibilities


Architect and implement robust ML pipelines and reusable frameworks across the full ML lifecycle in the multimedia domain, including data processing, efficient distributed model training with GPUs, and deploying models into creator workflows and production systems, personally developing critical components while providing technical leadership and mentorship to team members implementing other parts of the system
Collaborate cross-functionally with ML scientists, product managers, and engineers to define and prioritize system requirements
Partner with our ML platform team to translate technical needs into infrastructure requirements, advocating for platform capabilities that enhance reliability, boost team productivity, and support our long-term vision for innovation at scale
Optimize systems and workflows for latency, throughput, and reliability across both batch processing workflows and real-time services to meet SLA requirements
Strategically identify and address technical debt to improve development velocity, while implementing tools and processes that enhance team productivity and code quality


About You


5+ years of proven experience in software engineering for ML projects and products, with strong proficiency in Python
BSc in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related technical field.
Familiarity with ML libraries such as PyTorch, experience with ML/CV/GenAI pipelines, and knowledge of distributed data processing systems.
Experience with ML workflow orchestration tools like Metaflow, Airflow, or similar pipeline management systems
Proficient in cloud infrastructure, including S3, Docker containers.
Basic understanding of (multi) GPU training and inference for debugging and performance assessment, and CUDA runtime.
Demonstrated ability to effectively communicate technical requirements and influence infrastructure decisions across team boundaries
Track record of mentoring engineers on ML engineering best practices while balancing technical debt reduction with feature delivery
Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with a strong ability to navigate ambiguity.
You are collaborative and thrive in fast-paced dynamic environments, contributing positively to the team and company culture.
The Netflix culture resonates with you.


Bonus Experience


Experience with GPU training and inference optimization, performance tuning, and debugging
Experience building end-to-end multimedia systems and computer vision algorithms.
Familiarity with generative models and tools, such as diffusion-based models


Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $150,000 - $750,000.

Inclusion is a Netflix value and we strive to host a meaningful interview experience for all candidates. If you want an accommodation/adjustment for a disability or any other reason during the hiring process, please send a request to your recruiting partner.

We are an equal-opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity builds stronger teams. We approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, age, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic makeup, marital status, or military service.

We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

Over the past few months, and with a founding team consisting of Julien, second time founder with a PhD in materials science, and Katie, former experienced operator within the climate tech space, we have raised our first round of funding from leading investors, secured several letters of intent and demonstrated that we have a way of boosting the world's production of recycled copper.

We have developed a new wire-forming technology that produces high-conductivity copper wire without the need for 99.95% pure copper raw materials. No smelting. No refining. Just a smarter process.




By eliminating these costly and highly polluting steps, we are considerably reducing the overall cost of copper wire production, while making use of millions of tonnes of copper scrap currently unsuitable for electrical use. Our technology paves the way for fully circular and cost-effective copper wire production, making it an essential part of the global energy transition.

We’re now building our core team, and it’s the perfect time to jump on board.




About the role

We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in deep learning for predictive process control, to help us model and optimize our novel mechanical and thermal wire forming process.




You’ll take the lead on developing a model-based controller capable of anticipating system behavior and driving performance improvements in real-time. Your work will sit at the intersection of physical process modeling, data-driven algorithms, and real-world industrial systems.




Contract: CDI (permanent)
Location: Nanterre (hybrid)
Language: English fluency required. French is a plus but not required.




Your responsibilities

Develop and deploy predictive control algorithms to optimize mechanical and thermal processes for wire forming
Build hybrid models using deep learning and physics-based insights, incorporating process data and literature-based proxies
Design and implement efficient data collection pipelines from characterization methods to support model training and validation, to gather an optimized dataset
Simulate process dynamics, stress-test control logic, and run live tests on physical prototypes
Ensure the system is robust to uncertainties and ready for industrial scale-up




Ideal background

Engineering degree, MSc or PhD in Machine Learning, Control Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Material Science or related field
Strong hands on experience in model-based controlling and reinforcement learning for process control/material characterization
Proven track record applying deep learning to real-world physical systems
Proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, C++)
Familiarity with simulation tools (e.g., Abaqus, Ansys, Simulink, Modelica, or custom simulation environments)
Bonus: Experience working with manufacturing systems or industrial process control
Bonus: Demonstrated initiative in building and experimenting, whether through side projects, small-scale physical prototypes, or hands-on tinkering in a garage or lab




What we offer

We’re building a world-class industrial deep tech company, and we’re doing it from the ground up. You’ll be one of the earliest team members, shaping not only the tech, but the culture, direction, and impact of our start-up.




CDI contract
Competitive compensation + BSPCE package
50% health insurance coverage
Hybrid work model (office in Nanterre)




We believe deep tech needs deep diversity. We’re committed to building an inclusive, impact-driven team, and if you’re excited by our mission but don’t tick every box, we’d still love to hear from you. We value versatility and the ability to learn, which is absolutely essential at this stage of our business.




Let’s build the future of circular copper, together.

What’s more meaningful than seeing the real-world impact of your work?




Ok, maybe ending world hunger, but this is a strong second.

At OOONO, you’re not just building models in a notebook. You’re shaping the algorithms that directly power a physical product - used in real time by real people in the real world.

Join a small, collaborative team where you’re trusted to take ownership, test bold ideas, and push things into production. You’ll work hands-on with rich geospatial data to make our location logic smarter and faster.

And you’ll do it side by side with engineers, hardware specialists, and designers who genuinely care - about the product, the users, and each other.

What you’ll be doing

Develop and improve core algorithms to enhance product performance and user experience.
Contribute to map matching logic and road network analysis to improve location accuracy
Design, build, and maintain predictive models to solve complex business challenges.
Analyze large-scale data sets from Athena, MongoDB, and other sources to extract actionable insights.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Software, Hardware, UX/UI) to implement data-driven solutions.
Experiment with cutting-edge geospatial tools and frameworks to continuously improve analytical workflows.
Handle location data and geo spatial field.




We imagine you’re someone who has

A master’s degree in data science, geoinformatics or similar field
Proven experience (3+ years) in a Data Science role or similar, ideally within a tech environment and working with geospatial data
Proficiency in Python, including libraries such as Polars, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, Pyproj, Folium, Osmnx
Knowledge of geospatial analysis techniques (e.g., spatial joins, indexing, projections).
Strong understanding of statistical analysis, machine learning, and algorithm development.
Solid problem-solving skills and ability to work independently when needed
Hands-on person that can drive processes from A to B independently
English is a requirement.
Self-driven




How is it working at OOONO?

We’re glad we asked. It’s a nice working place. As in nice-nice. We have a relaxed, informal atmosphere and a flat hierarchy. Whenever you need a break from your important work stuff, you can get beat in table tennis, foosball, or just smalltalk about the weather by the coffee machine. We have monthly social events where we do anything from go-karting to going to festivals.

And when we’re not social? Then we’re pretty damn ambitious. We don’t like conservative targets or linear growth. We’re all about the extraordinary. This has led OOONO to become one of the fastest-growing tech scaleups and surprise-surprise: We have no plans of slowing down. So yes, OOONO is a lovely place to work, but it’s also a pretty good opportunity to develop as a person and take the next steps in your career.

Over the past few months, and with a founding team consisting of Julien, second time founder with a PhD in materials science, and Katie, former experienced operator within the climate tech space, we have raised our first round of funding from leading investors, secured several letters of intent and demonstrated that we have a way of boosting the world's production of recycled copper.

We have developed a new wire-forming technology that produces high-conductivity copper wire without the need for 99.95% pure copper raw materials. No smelting. No refining. Just a smarter process.




By eliminating these costly and highly polluting steps, we are considerably reducing the overall cost of copper wire production, while making use of millions of tonnes of copper scrap currently unsuitable for electrical use. Our technology paves the way for fully circular and cost-effective copper wire production, making it an essential part of the global energy transition.

We’re now building our core team, and it’s the perfect time to jump on board.




About the role

We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in deep learning for predictive process control, to help us model and optimize our novel mechanical and thermal wire forming process.




You’ll take the lead on developing a model-based controller capable of anticipating system behavior and driving performance improvements in real-time. Your work will sit at the intersection of physical process modeling, data-driven algorithms, and real-world industrial systems.




Contract: CDI (permanent)
Location: Nanterre (hybrid)
Language: English fluency required. French is a plus but not required.




Your responsibilities

Develop and deploy predictive control algorithms to optimize mechanical and thermal processes for wire forming
Build hybrid models using deep learning and physics-based insights, incorporating process data and literature-based proxies
Design and implement efficient data collection pipelines from characterization methods to support model training and validation, to gather an optimized dataset
Simulate process dynamics, stress-test control logic, and run live tests on physical prototypes
Ensure the system is robust to uncertainties and ready for industrial scale-up




Ideal background

Engineering degree, MSc or PhD in Machine Learning, Control Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Material Science or related field
Strong hands on experience in model-based controlling and reinforcement learning for process control/material characterization
Proven track record applying deep learning to real-world physical systems
Proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, C++)
Familiarity with simulation tools (e.g., Abaqus, Ansys, Simulink, Modelica, or custom simulation environments)
Bonus: Experience working with manufacturing systems or industrial process control
Bonus: Demonstrated initiative in building and experimenting, whether through side projects, small-scale physical prototypes, or hands-on tinkering in a garage or lab




What we offer

We’re building a world-class industrial deep tech company, and we’re doing it from the ground up. You’ll be one of the earliest team members, shaping not only the tech, but the culture, direction, and impact of our start-up.




CDI contract
Competitive compensation + BSPCE package
50% health insurance coverage
Hybrid work model (office in Nanterre)




We believe deep tech needs deep diversity. We’re committed to building an inclusive, impact-driven team, and if you’re excited by our mission but don’t tick every box, we’d still love to hear from you. We value versatility and the ability to learn, which is absolutely essential at this stage of our business.




Let’s build the future of circular copper, together.

That’s why we’re not just transforming cancer care—we’re changing lives.

We introduced precision medicine to the world and built an industry around the idea that every patient deserves answers as unique as their DNA. Backed by cutting-edge molecular science and AI, we ask ourselves every day: “What would I do if this patient were my mom?” That question drives everything we do.

But our mission doesn’t stop with cancer. We're pushing the frontiers of medicine and leading a revolution in healthcare—driven by innovation, compassion, and purpose.

Join us in our mission to improve the human condition across multiple diseases. If you're passionate about meaningful work and want to be part of something bigger than yourself, Caris is where your impact begins.

Experience working with large datasets (e.g., hundreds, or thousands of bams).
Enthusiasm for working in a highly collaborative environment.
Strong problem-solving and analytical skills.
Proven ability to manage time effectively, respond quickly to changing priorities, and adapt within a fast-paced environment.
Proficient in Microsoft Office Suite, specifically Word, Excel, Outlook, and general working knowledge of Internet for business use.

Diversity Equity Inclusion Statement

We believe every member of our team and student body deserves opportunities for growth, success and inclusion.

We believe that diversity in perspective, backgrounds, ethnicities and lived experience is a strength, and from that strength, we can accomplish great things with the students we serve.

Together as students, staff, organizations, communities, volunteers, and partners, we are intentional about creating safe spaces where all members can speak authentically and be themselves.

We are committed to Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity. As members of The Possible Zone community, our progression along this ongoing journey raises thoughtful questions, reveals biases, and opens conversations.

This work is our shared responsibility and our opportunity to welcome all members who share in our mission and strive to provide pathways that further prepare students in achieving their desired success.
