We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

Bolt's Experimentation Platform team is seeking a Senior Data Scientist to spearhead innovation in hypothesis testing and causal inference across the company.

About Us

With over 200 million customers in 50+ countries, Bolt is one of the fastest-growing tech companies in Europe and Africa. And it's all thanks to our people.

We believe in creating an inclusive environment where everyone is welcome, regardless of race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability.

Our ultimate goal is to make cities for people, not cars, and we need your help to achieve this mission!

About The Role

Our mission is to build a world-class experimentation ecosystem. You will be at the forefront, researching cutting-edge methodologies, building proofs-of-concept (PoCs), and collaborating to bring these innovations to life. Your initial focus will be on critical projects like improving our test design methodology and rolling out ML-powered variance reduction methods into production. Future areas of exploration include advanced holdout strategies, sequential testing, variance reduction techniques, and estimating treatment effects in marketplace experiments.

This role is ideal for you if you’re interested in a mix of technical work and collaboration, and working on a diverse range of interesting problems across the company. If you think you fit this profile, but are unsure about whether you meet other criteria, please apply, and we can discuss!

Main tasks and responsibilities:


Research, prototype, and validate novel statistical methods for A/B testing and causal inference relevant to Bolt's challenges.
Develop PoCs for new methodologies, working closely with our two dedicated data engineers to support moving successful concepts into production.
Drive the democratization of experimentation by improving self-serve tooling, developing educational materials, and providing direct consultation to product teams.
Collaborate closely with engineers and product managers to translate advanced statistical methods into robust, scalable platform features used by hundreds of people across Bolt.
Work closely with Data Science and Analyst teams across all verticals to prioritize your research agenda and drive experimentation best practices throughout the company.
Effectively communicate complex statistical concepts and experiment results to stakeholders of different levels of data literacy when needed, from Data Scientists and Analysts, to Product Managers, Engineers, and leadership.



About you:


2+ years of experience working in the tech industry in a Data Scientist/Analyst or Economist role
Be able to translate novel methods from research papers on experimentation and causal inference into PoCs.
Deep understanding and practical application of Statistical Hypothesis Testing and A/B Testing / Randomized Controlled Trials (including advanced techniques).
Strong stakeholder management skills, notably collaborating with and influencing Data Scientists and Analysts.
Proficiency in R or Python (we work in Python, but this can be acquired) and SQL.
Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.
Accelerate your professional growth with unique career opportunities.
Get a rewarding salary and stock option package that lets you focus on doing your best work.
Enjoy the flexibility of working in a hybrid mode with a minimum of 3 days in the office each week to foster strong connections and teamwork.
Take care of your physical and mental health with our wellness perks.
Some perks may differ depending on your location and role.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Out humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Merchant Group At Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.
Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partners - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com) and Jaksa Marojevic (jaksa.marojevic@external.wolt.com)

Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Bolt's Experimentation Platform team is seeking a Senior Data Scientist to spearhead innovation in hypothesis testing and causal inference across the company.

About Us

With over 200 million customers in 50+ countries, Bolt is one of the fastest-growing tech companies in Europe and Africa. And it's all thanks to our people.

We believe in creating an inclusive environment where everyone is welcome, regardless of race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability.

Our ultimate goal is to make cities for people, not cars, and we need your help to achieve this mission!

About The Role

Our mission is to build a world-class experimentation ecosystem. You will be at the forefront, researching cutting-edge methodologies, building proofs-of-concept (PoCs), and collaborating to bring these innovations to life. Your initial focus will be on critical projects like improving our test design methodology and rolling out ML-powered variance reduction methods into production. Future areas of exploration include advanced holdout strategies, sequential testing, variance reduction techniques, and estimating treatment effects in marketplace experiments.

This role is ideal for you if you’re interested in a mix of technical work and collaboration, and working on a diverse range of interesting problems across the company. If you think you fit this profile, but are unsure about whether you meet other criteria, please apply, and we can discuss!

Main tasks and responsibilities:


Research, prototype, and validate novel statistical methods for A/B testing and causal inference relevant to Bolt's challenges.
Develop PoCs for new methodologies, working closely with our two dedicated data engineers to support moving successful concepts into production.
Drive the democratization of experimentation by improving self-serve tooling, developing educational materials, and providing direct consultation to product teams.
Collaborate closely with engineers and product managers to translate advanced statistical methods into robust, scalable platform features used by hundreds of people across Bolt.
Work closely with Data Science and Analyst teams across all verticals to prioritize your research agenda and drive experimentation best practices throughout the company.
Effectively communicate complex statistical concepts and experiment results to stakeholders of different levels of data literacy when needed, from Data Scientists and Analysts, to Product Managers, Engineers, and leadership.



About you:


2+ years of experience working in the tech industry in a Data Scientist/Analyst or Economist role
Be able to translate novel methods from research papers on experimentation and causal inference into PoCs.
Deep understanding and practical application of Statistical Hypothesis Testing and A/B Testing / Randomized Controlled Trials (including advanced techniques).
Strong stakeholder management skills, notably collaborating with and influencing Data Scientists and Analysts.
Proficiency in R or Python (we work in Python, but this can be acquired) and SQL.
Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.
Accelerate your professional growth with unique career opportunities.
Get a rewarding salary and stock option package that lets you focus on doing your best work.
Enjoy the flexibility of working in a hybrid mode with a minimum of 3 days in the office each week to foster strong connections and teamwork.

This is a new position for a Machine Learning Engineer, working primarily at The Royal Marsden but in close collaboration with The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR).

The Royal Marsden, together with its academic partner the ICR, is designated as the UK's only NIHR BRC dedicated solely to cancer.

This post is suitable for an engineer or scientist with the desire to apply machine and deep learning methodology to real-world clinical problems. The Machine Learning Engineer will be working on a programme whose aims are to evaluate and help develop state-of-the-art AI algorithms using a dedicated machine learning operations (MLOps) platform. Algorithms that pass the evaluation will be used by clinicians managing the treatment of cancer patients, and by scientists developing and evaluating novel therapies.

The Successful Post Holder Will Be An Active Member And Will Be Supported By Team Members And Infrastructure Within The AI Imaging Hub

Leadership. The Hub is led by 2 co-directors and managed by a transformation lead.

Multidisciplinary manpower. The hub hosts data scientists, informaticians, research radiographers and radiographer AI champions, radiologist AI champions, clinical trial managers and coordinators; imaging scientists and students. We work closely with key partners such as the clinical MRI research group, Integrated Pathology Unit, Biomedical Research Informatics Digital Environment (BRIDgE) teams and Data Stewards Group.

Data access and organisation. Our in-house expertise has created an image repository – XNAT - which has now been adopted by the 7 CRUK NCITA sites as the data repository platform of choice. The hub team will maintain and expand the capabilities of XNAT, which is the backbone data management system for our imaging AI and radiomics pipelines and has provided crucial leverage in securing competitive funding. We have recently set up a machine learning operations (MLOps) platform to evaluate AI algorithms, either developed in house or brought in by a third party, in a real-world clinical environment.

The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust is a world-leading cancer centre. Our role is to offer our patients the best cancer care available anywhere in the world, and to continue to make a global contribution to finding better ways of diagnosing and treating cancer. We employ over 4,500 staff in a diverse range of careers including nursing, medical, science, radiography, pharmacy, occupational therapy, finance and administrative services. We have two hospitals – one in Chelsea, London, and one in Sutton, Surrey – as well as a Medical Daycare Unit in Kingston Hospital.

At The Royal Marsden, we deal with cancer every day, so we understand how valuable life is. When people entrust their lives to us, they have the right to demand the very best. That's why the pursuit of excellence lies at the heart of everything we do.

At the heart of the hospital is our dedicated team. We offer a stimulating and dynamic working environment, a wide range of staff benefits, learning and development opportunities and clear career pathways. There are opportunities to work flexibly across a range of areas and specialities and we welcome flexible working requests from point of hire to support employees work life balance. We are looking for employees who aspire to excellence, share our values and can play a crucial role in our on-going achievements.

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Overview:

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms.

We believe that everyone can have equal and unconstrained access to educational experiences on par with Oxford, Cambridge, CalTech, et cetera. We believe that this can be achieved with a new class of learning tools, which combine advances in cognitive science, language models, and datasets. We are building these tools in England.

Our first product, Grasp Concepts, enables students to disambiguate and learn concepts through great online explanations and is deployed with design partners including Imperial College London. Our second product, Grasp Pathways, decomposes learning goals and suggests flexible learning trajectories to reach them, using reputable learning resources like books and lectures, and is in private alpha. An on-demand, online oxbridge-like experience.

Team and Funding

We've raised significant capital from top tier investors including Balderton Capital, Mozilla (yes, Firefox), and Point9. Our founder Ed built the Payments and Trading products at Revolut alongside his bachelors and masters degrees. He was also one of a handful of investors at DST Global. Our team have backgrounds in elite institutions including Revolut, Huawei, Max-Planck Institute, Oxford, and Cambridge. We're building something so hard we cannot afford to work with anyone but the best.

Location: London

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Machine Learning Engineer with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)


If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Machine Learning Engineer with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$193,500 - C$290,300. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Intermediate knowledge of SQL with the ability to create clean and transform datasets, ideally with DBT
Collaborative and verbose communication about why and how we approach business questions
Strong programming skills with working knowledge of machine learning packages such as sklearn, pandas, numpy, tensorflow, etc

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

In this role, you will contribute directly to Neo's mission of building a better financial future for all Canadians by applying data science principles within a rapidly scaling fintech environment. This position offers a significant opportunity for professional growth, allowing you to develop your technical skills and gain practical experience by tackling complex business challenges. You will collaborate closely with experienced professionals, contributing to impactful projects while embodying Neo's core values of Teamwork, Ownership, and Professional Integrity.

What You'll Be Doing


Monitor existing credit risk models for performance deterioration
Redevelop existing credit risk models with more recent data and business changes or performance deterioration
Ensure any updated model still fits business usage and assist in analysis of downstream impact
Develop new ML models based on credit risk’s business needs
Documentation of updated or newly developed models for business audience
Enhancing model explainability and business trust
Establishing rigorous model validation frameworks (e.g., OOT validation, temporal splits, cross-validation) to ensure high model quality and generalization
Partnering with business teams to ensure models are solving real business problems and delivering commercial value


Who We Are Looking For


An intermediate-level Data Scientist with a focus in credit risk modeling with 2+ years relevant experience, who has proven success developing ML models for financial fraud and/or losses, with an emphasis on reducing credit loss
Technical expertise with Python (including pandas, scikit-learn), and tree-based/ML modeling (Random forest, XGBoost)
Strong ML validation testing, such as OOT testing, and robust backtesting.
Ability to explain, present and document models in a business friendly way
A pragmatic, business-first mindset — someone who can move fast, prioritize delivering value in days/weeks (not months), and thrive in an ambiguous, fast-paced environment
Experience with Git and Sagemaker is a plus

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations

Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$142,400 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$193,500 - C$290,300. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Support Experience engineering team builds and improves Stripe’s user support from end to end: how users get help within our products, how they get in touch with us when they have questions, and how our teams use internal tools to answer those questions. We’re accountable for the quality and reliability of this support stack and we use data and firsthand user research to continuously improve it.

Providing great support to users of all sizes is culturally important to everyone at Stripe. We are a group of friendly, user-oriented engineers that partner closely with Stripe’s world-class design, product, and operational teams. This includes the external-facing support interfaces (support.stripe.com), content, entry points, internal tooling, case routing, and helping product teams across the company reduce support volume by improving our products. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine support experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive.

What you’ll do

As a Machine Learning Engineer on the Support Experience team, you'll play a crucial role in enhancing our self-serve support experiences. You will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production. For example, we apply LLMs to answer user questions with conversational agents and personalize product documentation, and are building automated systems to solve complex user problems. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers, product managers, and data scientists to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Design and implement state-of-the-art ML models and large scale ML systems for enhancing self-serve support capabilities, balancing ML principles, domain knowledge, and engineering constraints
Develop and optimize contextual conversation models and ML-powered resolution flows for common support scenarios, using tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and XGBoost
Create and refine pipelines for training and evaluating models in both offline and online environments, with a focus on improving support quality and user satisfaction
Implement ML features that streamline information collection and processing for support agents, enhancing overall support efficiency
Collaborate with product, strategy, and content teams to propose, prioritize, and implement new AI-driven support features and improve answer capabilities
Stay current with the latest developments in ML/AI, particularly in natural language processing and conversational AI, and apply innovative ideas to improve support experiences



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about building ML systems that touch the lives of millions. You have experience developing efficient feature pipelines, building advanced ML models, and deploying them to production. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, have a bias towards action, and thrive in a collaborative environment.

Minimum Requirements


Bachelor's Degree in ML/AI or related field (e.g. math, physics, statistics)
You have a strong technical background, including 7+ years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Proficient with ML libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, as well as Spark
Knowledge of various ML algorithms and model architectures
Hands-on experience in designing, training, evaluating & productionizing machine learning models at scale



Preferred Qualifications


MS/PhD degree in ML/AI or related field (e.g. math, physics, statistics)
Previous leadership or mentorship experience
Previous experience building ML solutions focused on support
Experience with LLMs and prompt engineering
Comfortable working with distributed teams across multiple locations and time zones
Proven track record of building and deploying ML systems that have effectively solved ambiguous business problems



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$193,500 - C$290,300. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

We believe in maximizing authentic and mutually beneficial human connections for business growth, which is why CoPilot AI automatically targets qualified people on social media, initiates one-to-one conversations, and surfaces timely sales opportunities without requiring any cold calling, events, or expensive advertising. Our goal is to create a place where our customers can have more meaningful conversations at scale.




As we scale into the next phase, we are looking for a Vancouver-based Data Scientist to join our Engineering, Product, and Design (EPD) team!




The Role




This is a unique opportunity for a highly motivated and self-driven individual who is passionate about data science to make a tangible impact in the rapidly growing field of AI sales tools.

As a member of the EPD team, you will collaborate closely with engineering, product, and design colleagues, while also engaging directly with senior leadership, including C-suite executives and department directors. In this role, you will take full ownership of the data function, applying a customer-centric and business impact perspective to provide insights and influence strategic business decisions. Your expertise in data science will enable you to produce actionable recommendations, conduct thorough data analyses, and effectively communicate your findings with clarity and confidence to leadership and stakeholders throughout the organization.







What you’ll do:




Data Science Leadership: As the pioneer data scientist at CoPilot AI, you will shape the future of our data platform and champion a culture of data-driven decision-making.
Product Development Integration: As a member of the EPD (engineering, product and design) team, you will work alongside ML/AI engineers, software engineers, product designers, and product managers in an agile scrum team setting.
Customer Behaviour Insights: Uncover patterns to pinpoint behaviours that lead to successful customer outcomes, enabling scalable, repeatable retention and growth.
Dashboarding and Reporting: Create impactful self-service dashboards and automated reporting solutions, democratizing data access and empowering informed decisions.
Collaboration and Communication: Clearly and compellingly communicate your insights and recommendations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, influencing critical business decisions.
Statistical Analysis Expertise: Leverage statistical analysis to validate hypothesis and continuously improve product performance by applying the Lean Startup build-measure-learn (BML) methodology.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Dive deep into exploratory data analysis to reveal powerful insights and trends, driving strategic product decisions.
Data Transformation: Leverage dbt, materialized views and other tools/techniques to take raw data into a analysis ready state.




This is a highly valued and critical role within the company, and our expectations are equally high. Whatever you do should drive growth and impact. We will reward the right candidate with career growth, professional development opportunities and perks. Most importantly, you will be part of a success story, joining a team of high-performing professionals committed to excellence.







Who you are:




You have 4-6+ years of experience as a data scientist, with a proven track record of independently executing projects across the full data stack. 
You have a strong proficiency in SQL and Python, experience using data warehousing solutions (e.g., Snowflake or similar). While you don’t need to be a data engineer, you’re comfortable interfacing with data engineering workflows and have some hands-on familiarity with tools like Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, dbt, or similar.
You have a deep understanding of SaaS product analytics and KPIs - MRR, DAU/MAU, CAC:LTV, TTV, activation, funnel analysis, retention cohorts and NPS are all familiar concepts.
You apply AI to your craft beyond simple ChatGPT Q&A tasks - Cursor, Hex, Cortex or others are part of your high productivity daily workflow.
You combine your strong business acumen with statistical expertise (e.g., confidence intervals, regression modelling, significance testing) and have demonstrated experience with common machine learning techniques for deep data mining and exploration (e.g., predictive modelling, time series modelling, classification, and clustering techniques).
You are competent in developing interactive KPIs and self-serve dashboards/visualizations using tools such as GoodData, Looker, Tableau, or Power BI.
You have excellent communication skills, adept at translating complex data into actionable insights for diverse stakeholders, and you're comfortable presenting complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders.
You believe that an imperfect MVP solution delivered today, is better than a perfect solution tomorrow.







What’s in it for you:




Competitive Compensation: A competitive annual base salary between the range of $105,000 - $115,000 CAD.
Hybrid Work Environment: Enjoy the flexibility of a hybrid work environment where CoPilotteers come into our downtown Vancouver (Coal Harbour) office 2 days per week and work from home when you need it.
Comprehensive Benefits: We've got you covered with a comprehensive benefits package, including health, dental, and vision insurance.
Health and Wellness Spending Account: We care about your well-being inside and outside the office. You will receive an additional $200 per month for a health and wellness spending account that accrues upon passing probation - our team uses it for their at-home office setup, electronics, gym memberships, haircuts, and more!
Paid Time Off: We offer a generous paid time off policy as we believe that rest and rejuvenation are key for high performance.
Stock Options: Upon joining CoPilot AI, you will receive stock options with the expectation of significant value. We're a team of high performers working together on a breakthrough success story, and we want you to share in the value we're creating.
Culture Building Initiatives: Company-wide events hosted by our Culture Committee, as well as regular team events, designed to foster connections between CoPilotteers.

Spring Financial is revolutionizing financial access for Canadians, providing smart credit-building, mortgage, and lending solutions. Millions struggle with high-interest debt and limited financial options—we’re here to change that.

As one of Canada’s fastest-growing fintech companies, annually we help 1 million customers explore their financing options with ease—online, via text, or over the phone. Our dynamic, innovative team thrives on collaboration, growth, and making a real impact.

To learn more about our products please visit our website here: www.springfinancial.ca.

NOTE: This is a full-time, permanent, hybrid position in downtown Vancouver, with 3 set days in the office and 2 WFH.

Job Overview

As a Senior Data Scientist at Spring, you are a strategic thought partner and technical leader. You drive high-impact analytical and modeling initiatives that directly shape our products, strategy, and operations. You bring structure to ambiguous problem spaces, influence decision-making across the company, and help define best practices for how data science is done at Spring.

You lead cross-functional efforts that combine data exploration, experimentation, and machine learning. You balance technical depth with strong business judgment — helping teams understand not only what the data says, but what it means and what to do about it.

You proactively identify areas where AI and advanced analytics can unlock step-change improvements. You explore and validate use cases for LLMs, generative models, and intelligent automation — collaborating with product and ML teams to pilot and productionize solutions where appropriate.

You are a mentor and multiplier — helping others grow through design reviews, feedback, and shared tooling. You influence data architecture decisions and help shape a culture where analytical rigor and business outcomes go hand in hand.

What You’ll Do


Lead complex data science initiatives with business-critical outcomes.
Build models, simulations, or experiments that inform strategic bets or optimize systems at scale.
Explore and champion the application of AI/LLMs to accelerate product and operational insight.
Partner with cross-functional leads to define KPIs, set strategy, and evaluate long-term impact.
Mentor other data scientists and collaborate on improving team practices and tools.
Influence data quality, architecture, and governance decisions across engineering and product.


What You Should Already Have


Strong track record of delivering high-impact data science work in a product-driven company.
Deep expertise in statistics, experimentation, modeling, and data storytelling.
Familiarity with AI/ML trends, including the use of foundation models or LLM APIs in business settings.
Proven ability to lead projects through ambiguity, across teams, and with executive visibility.
Excellent communication skills; able to explain complex ideas clearly and persuasively to any audience.
Passion for mentoring and elevating analytical thinking across the organization.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $120,000 to $150,000, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more. Due to high application volume, we may not be able to respond to everyone.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.
