Stiamo creando oggi un nuovo team di AI Engineering la cui missione sarà quella di sbloccare il valore nascosto in un immenso patrimonio di dati non strutturati attraverso tecniche di Natural Language Processing e Deep Learning trasformando ogni aspetto della banca: dalle valutazioni di rischio di credito e propensione dei clienti, all’automazione dei processi.




Responsabilità chiave:

Prototipare, mettere in produzione e manutenere modelli di AI (NLP e predittiva) utilizzando Python/SAS e strumenti Microsoft Azure.
Estrarre insight da testo, voce, immagini e altre fonti non strutturate fuori dalla portata di strumenti analitici tradizionali.
Pacchettizzare modelli come endpoint REST o batch (Docker, Azure Functions) integrandoli con Power Apps e API interne.
Collaborare con i team Rischio, Marketing, IT e Compliance per tradurre le esigenze di business in soluzioni scalabili.
Esplorare continuamente nuovi algoritmi e strumenti, condividere le scoperte attraverso tech talk interni.
Contribuire a pratiche di AI responsabile, garantendo equità, trasparenza e sostenibilità in tutti i nostri modelli.




Cosa stiamo cercando:

Un/una brillante laureato/a (con massimo di 3 anni di esperienza lavorativa) in Statistica, Ingegneria, Fisica, Matematica.
Solida conoscenza della modellazione statistica e delle tecniche di analisi dei dati, con padronanza di Python, R o SAS.
Eccellenti capacità interpersonali e di comunicazione, con la capacità di collaborare efficacemente con team eterogenei.
Curiosità, passione per le tecnologie emergenti e una mentalità orientata all'apprendimento continuo per tenere il passo con gli strumenti AI in rapida evoluzione.




Qualifiche preferenziali (costituiscono un plus):

Esperienza con modelli di AI generativa, prompt engineering, embedding, deep learning e architetture transformer.
Familiarità con gli strumenti Microsoft Azure AI Foundry, MLOps, Power Automate e Power Apps.
Partecipazione a competizioni Kaggle o progetti ML open-source.
Precedente esperienza nei servizi finanziari o nella consulenza, in particolare nella gestione del rischio o nei processi di credito.




Cosa offriamo:

Vasto patrimonio di dati reali: contrariamente a quanto avviene nelle startup tecnologiche o nelle società di consulenza, lavorerai con dati finanziari proprietari e reali su una scala senza precedenti.
Responsabilità end-to-end: ideerai e implementerai modelli che guideranno importanti processi bancari, acquisendo una profonda conoscenza del credito al consumo.
Apprendimento continuo: rimarrai all'avanguardia dell'innovazione AI, supportato/a da una cultura che incoraggia curiosità, sperimentazione e sviluppo professionale.
Strumenti all'avanguardia: la possibilità di lavorare con tecnologie di ultima generazione, tra cui Microsoft Azure AI Foundry, Power Apps e cluster di GPU.

Quale sarà la tua sfida? 

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere. 

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 5 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus. 

Il/La Data Scientist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze di AI e Machine Learning, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in algoritmi e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi. 

I/Le nostri/e Data Scientist verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove comprenderanno le esigenze del Cliente, daranno indicazione ai Data Engineer sulla preparazione desiderata dei dati, sceglieranno o costruiranno i migliori mix di modelli più adatti al caso specifico, discuteranno gli output con il cliente e consegneranno il modello per l’ottimizzazione e passaggio in produzione finale ai Data Engineer. 

In contesti più semplificati in cui la componente di Data Engineering è meno elaborata, i nostri Data Scientist procederanno in autonomia anche nella data preparation e nel porting in produzione dei modelli ingegnerizzati. 

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Data Scientist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Power digital products with AI. Work with product teams to identify high-impact opportunities where AI can transform the user experience for millions—and then build the solutions to make them happen. Drive the process from possibility to production, delivering code that’s robust, reproducible, and built for scale.
Explore ways to push the boundaries of our AI capabilities. Stay at the bleeding edge of AI by investigating new models, techniques, and research. Learn fast across new domains, share findings with the team, and turn breakthrough ideas into production systems that deliver real-world impact.
Refine data foundations for exceptional results. Own the full data lifecycle—from acquisition and labeling to loading and management—to ensure our models are trained on clean, high-quality datasets that power top-performing systems.
Own your impact, end-to-end. Set smart priorities, manage execution, and consistently deliver high-quality results, even in ambiguous or fast-changing environments. Balance technical depth with strong ownership, growing your skills while delivering meaningful contributions.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.




Commitment & contract

Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.




Location

Milan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.




Before you apply

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don’t hesitate to apply.




The selection process

If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Quale sarà la tua sfida? 

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere. 

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 5 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus. 

Il/La Data Scientist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze di AI e Machine Learning, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in algoritmi e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi. 

I/Le nostri/e Data Scientist verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove comprenderanno le esigenze del Cliente, daranno indicazione ai Data Engineer sulla preparazione desiderata dei dati, sceglieranno o costruiranno i migliori mix di modelli più adatti al caso specifico, discuteranno gli output con il cliente e consegneranno il modello per l’ottimizzazione e passaggio in produzione finale ai Data Engineer. 

In contesti più semplificati in cui la componente di Data Engineering è meno elaborata, i nostri Data Scientist procederanno in autonomia anche nella data preparation e nel porting in produzione dei modelli ingegnerizzati. 

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Data Scientist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

We want to innovate the financial services offered by commercial/retail banks in Italy in the areas of wealth management, credit lending, risk management and compliance. Building on our consolidated expertise and product offering in the Capital Markets domain, we want to scale our solutions and frameworks to the commercial/retail banking industry. To do so, we start from the quantitative modelling and analysis of the current processes put in place by our customers, so that we can profile opportunities of automation and prioritize client needs on manual/painful workflows. The resource will be involved in business process analyses of Italian commercial/retail financial institutions and is expected to integrate structured information extracted from interviews with the analysis of literature and documentation to build a quantitative picture of the AS-IS. The analysis will then be complemented with a consequent implementation analysis and product roadmap definition to design the TO-BE and drive product evolutions and developments. The project entails modelling complex business contexts, extracting structured information from unstructured sources, performing quantitative analyses, presenting findings and recommendations to external clients and internal stakeholders, contributing to the definition of product backlogs.

What You Will Learn During Your Intern


Quantitative modelling of business processes
Codification of customer requirements, needs, activities
Business intelligence with PowerBI/Excel - Packaging high-quality deliverables for external clients –
Data manipulation with Pandas or Spark/Hive

You’ll work with McKinsey’s agricultural analytics team (ACRE) in Brussels.

Our Agriculture Practice advises agribusiness, consumer food, government, and investor clients on strategic, marketing & sales, and operations issues, helping support industry-shaping decisions that impact the future of global food production.

Within this group, ACRE is a team of expert consultants, data scientists, and engineers focused on bringing cutting-edge analytics to our agribusiness clients. We apply real-time data and advanced analytics – generally predictive or geospatial in nature – to solve the biggest problems currently facing global agricultural markets, driving insights at the micro and macro levels.

ACRE is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients.

Your Impact

You will leverage industry knowledge and analytical expertise to provide insights both to clients as part of client service teams and within the agricultural analytics team (ACRE) by strengthening the core products and algorithms we build for clients. You can expect to split your time delivering impact at clients (including up to ~50% travel to client sites) and building up ACRE’s core analytical offerings.

As a member of client service teams, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to tackle clients’ most pressing issues using an analytical lens, meeting client needs and communicating your work to executive audiences. Issues to solve could include determining the suitability (now and in the future given impacts of climate change) of growing different types of crops across different geographies, using local agronomic data and satellite imagery to determine market potential for input products, or optimizing farm operations using yield forecasting. Your work will often include heavy geospatial components and/or predictive analytics components.

When working internally with the ACRE team, you will build innovative algorithms and products (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will use global data such as geospatial, biological, economic and climatological data to develop proprietary solutions. You will work with our engineers to design new interfaces to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.

Along the way, you will receive best-in-class training in structuring business problems and serving as a client adviser and have opportunities to work closely with and learn from our senior agriculture practitioners and industry players that are shaping the future of food production. You will get access to unparalleled career acceleration, with a huge amount of ownership and responsibility from the get-go in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will get the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world. Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest agribusiness players around the globe.

We encourage you to submit a cover letter to highlight why you believe that you are a unique fit for our team and what we do! We will read it.

Iemand die samen met ons wil groeien!




ACA’s Innovation Lab is het nieuwe businessconcept van ACA Group. In ons Innovation Lab groeien innovatieve ideeën uit tot gevalideerde businessconcepten.




Hoe wij (samen)werken?




Omdat wij een relatief nieuw team zijn, hanteren we geen ‘business-as-usual’ proces. We werken in een dynamische omgeving die eigenlijk vergelijkbaar is met een start-up binnen een groter geheel. ACA investeert een substantieel deel van haar winst in het “ACA Innovation Lab” zodat er ruimte is om nieuwe ideeën en technologieën af te toetsen.

We hebben bij ACA gekozen voor een proactieve aanpak om innovatie (AI en Machine Learning) bij onze klanten te stimuleren. Dit heeft ons de kans gegeven om samen met onze klanten een aantal nieuwe oplossingen te ontwikkelen door het gebruik van AI en ML.




Waar jij mee aan zal werken (tech & omgeving)?




Python & Java
Kubernetes & Kubeflow
AWS / GCP
Jupyter notebooks
Git
Tensorflow
Machine Vision toolkits (YOLO, OpenCV, …)
Wandb
MLFlow




Ben jij de geknipte persoon voor deze rol?




Hard skills

Je hebt minstens 3 jaar relevante ervaring met Machine Learning.
Je hebt ervaring als tech lead in een nieuwe start-up omgeving.
Je hebt een goede kennis van het Engels en/of Nederlands.
Je hebt een goede kennis van software development.
Je flexibel kunnen opstellen in een dynamische werkomgeving. Prioriteiten stellen vormen voor jou dan ook geen probleem.
Ervaring in een test-driven development en Agile omgeving.




Soft skills

Je bezit goede communicatieve vaardigheden.
Je bent een teamplayer, maar je gaat ook graag zelfstandig te werk.
Je bent proactief ingesteld en gemotiveerd om nieuwe uitdagingen aan te gaan!




Hoe voelt dat, werken bij ACA?




Innovatieve werkomgeving: je werkt met de nieuwste technologie en tools in een omgeving die innovatie uitademt.
Een aantrekkelijk loon, een bedrijfswagen, maaltijdcheques, onkostenvergoeding, MacBook Pro en nog veel meer.
Leren & groeien: bij ACA heeft iedereen een on-the-job coach. Je beschikt over een persoonlijk evolutieplan met een budget voor technische en professionele trainingen en heel wat kansen om bij te leren.
We’ve got your back: we voorzien een uitgebreid gezondheids- en verzekeringsplan om tegemoet te komen aan jouw noden. Het is onze prioriteit om ervoor te zorgen dat onze collega’s gelukkig zijn, o.a. door een goede work-life balans, de juiste tools te voorzien, enzovoort.
Onze unieke bedrijfscultuur: je bent deel van een passioneel en hardwerkend team dat trots is op hun verwezenlijkingen. ACA is een plek waar teamwork, transparantie, kennisdeling en erkenning centraal staan. Trots om ons ""Great Place To Work"" te noemen!
Jij staat centraal: wij zijn gedreven door onze teamleden waarbij iedereen hun steentje bijdraagt, maar waar plaats is voor heel wat fun. Een fantastisch team werkt niet alleen samen, maar maakt ook samen plezier. Daarom organiseren we heel wat activiteiten binnen en buiten onze kantoren en vertrekken we elk jaar op een spetterend ACA-weekend!

You work within the department of CISS of the Faculty of Polytechnic of the RMA and in close collaboration with researcher, scientists and engineers from the other consortium partners. You conduct scientific research at university level on a project entitled ‘SHABAM’.

The EDA ad hoc project type B called SHABAM for “SHAring BAndwidth in Military systems” will investigate the capability of DSM concepts to allow efficient spectrum usage between radio systems in an operation theatre that may consist of several nations operating on several co-operative or non-co-operative waveforms. Another challenge will be to provide robust improvements to the super high fidelity simulator to accommodate the new objectives, such as adding new UHF and VHF basic waveforms. The consortium is composed of 10 prime contractors, representing 5 different countries (BE, FI, FR, GE, NO). The Consortium Coordinator is Thales SIX from France.




MAIN TASKS:

Adding a second VHF waveform using bandwidth scaling. The N1 mode of the NBWF offers only a limited transmission capacity. A higher bit rate, by compromising some range, will render NBWF more interesting for bridging IP communication or control traffic, supporting UHF waveform, etc
Control of WF frequency hopping sequences : the idea is to control the VHF/UHF frequency hopping sequences of the communication networks for the coexistence of heterogeneous waveforms using Local DSM with cross-waveform signaling
VHF rate adaption : Having the possibility to use multiple bit rates within the same VHF network will add flexibility in dynamic environments where link characteristics change over time. To be able to handle multiple bit rates in the same VHF network, a link adaptation mechanism is needed at the link layer.




SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:

Degree(s) required: Master degree in Telecommunication Engineer (MSc), or equivalent, with firm background on Signal and Systems theory, digital communications and electronics.

This position is open for experienced profiles (ideally 3 years of experience minimum).




“MUST HAVE” skills :

Good experience in SDR/digital communications : modulation schemes, error correction coding, characterization of communication links (channel distortion, BER, FER)
Good experience in digital signal processing : digital filtering, digital modulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, interference mitigation etc.
Software Programming : MATLAB, C/C++ , Python.




“NICE TO HAVE” skills :

Knowledge of Dynamic Spectrum Management
Knowledge of Routing Algorithms (e.g. OLSR)
Knowledge of Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence.




Personal skills :

You conduct scientific research in an independent and upright way within a multidisciplinary environment.
You think in an innovative and creative way.
You communicate your results in a clear, concise and precise manner.
You solve problems autonomously and find alternatives or solutions.




Other skills:

The applicant shall have good knowledge of English (oral / written).
Minimum knowledge of French or Dutch is an added value for collaboration with peers.

You facilitate the communication between AI & Analytics teams and IT production with regards to the deployment of ML models, ensuring that models put in production are equipped with the appropriate data pipelines and monitoring.
You work with the Data Scientists to define and develop the target solution with production constraints in mind. This allows to select the correct run infrastructure and serving model (e.g. data ingestion scheme, API synchronicity …) to address the business requirements (real-time responses, processing volumetry …).
You contribute to the automation of the different elements of the ML pipeline in order to integrate and deploy them in the production environment (e.g. building Docker/VM images, prepare unitary, regression and integration tests …).
You support Data Scientists on the usage of the existing industrial solutions available to build and monitor AI services (i.e. the CI/CD tools).
You support IT Production on the parameterization of the target environment.
You ensure that the model runs without errors, is retrained if needed (incl. automatically) and is monitored both from the IT and the business perspective.

You’ll have the opportunity to build with the best in the industry while driving Gr4vy’s product marketing strategy from the ground up.

About The Role

Software Engineers at Gr4vy collaborate across product, engineering, design, and other stakeholders. We work in short two week sprints & regularly share, reflect on and iterate on our work.

Our platform uses Python and the FastAPI framework along with React and Typescript for most of our frontend. We use unit, integration and acceptance tests to drive design and keep everything working.

Key Responsibilities


You actively contribute to the team's projects and follow best coding practices.
You are open to learning new design patterns for backend tasks.
You have influence over the tasks within your immediate team.
You work with the product manager to ensure understanding of tasks.
You work with support from senior engineers to better understand problems and solutions.
You review PRs from peers to better understand how others are implementing solutions.


Requirements

We’re looking for developers with practical experience and knowledge with coding, testing, and debugging in Python.

Why you’ll love working at Gr4vy

You’ll be joining at a truly momentous time in our company’s life cycle. We want your imprint on how the world experiences Gr4vy as the leader in the fast-growing cloud payments space. Come and bring your skills to a growing team of 11. You’ll influence, challenge and help build our inclusive culture and passion for equity. A global identity is in Gr4vy’s DNA, with employees currently spanning Europe and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Our Fine Print

We choose laughter first. Sometimes our standups veer into debates about food, family (furballs included), and unlimited lifehack fails. We’re committed to learning, to advocating, and to doing better for our customers and ourselves, every day.

Diversity statement

We value all the great benefits that diversity brings and encourage everyone to bring their whole self at work, regardless of gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age or disability.

We build in-silico tools that let our Medicinal-Chemistry and Biology colleagues make faster, smarter decisions throughout hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead-optimization.

We’re searching for research engineers who love creating algorithms, models, and systems that unlock value in small-molecule drug-discovery workflows and advance the state-of-the-art in ML for chemistry.




Key qualifications:




Hands-on deep-learning expertise with a focus on molecular-representation learning: graph neural networks (GNNs), 3-D transformers, diffusion/flow models, or large language models for chemistry (e.g., SELFIES/SMILES transformers).
Solid technical foundations in mathematics and statistics;
Proficient programming skills in Python and one or more of the ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, and JAX;
Familiarity with MLOps & DevOps (Docker, Git, CI/CD, experiment tracking, cloud computer).
Ability to work in a collaborative environment across different geographical regions;




What you'll do:




We have seen that machine learning methods applied to problems in protein engineering can genuinely be impactful. Furthermore, these in-silico methods can be even more rewarding, when they are put to the test in our lab as part of our drug development programs. You will be working in a team of talented and driven engineers and scientists, who are striving to make a difference in drug development and open to applying novel techniques in order to contribute to our understanding of some of the most relevant areas of protein science.




The role mainly involves:




Design novel ML/AI algorithms for small-molecule tasks e.g., property prediction, binding-affinity estimation, activity cliffs, ADME/Tox, and generative molecule design.
Integrate physics-based methods with data-driven models to build hybrid, end-to-end pipelines.
Build & own our chemistry-focused MLOps stack, taking models from research to robust production services.
Explore blue-sky research directions while balancing near-term program needs.
Collaborate closely with medicinal chemists and biologists, translating model insights into tangible design hypotheses and experimental campaigns.
Communicate results to technical and non-technical stakeholders papers, internal seminars, open-source contributions, and conference talks.




Education & Experience:




PhD (or MS + 2 yrs experience) in Computer Science, Computational Chemistry, Cheminformatics, Chemical Engineering, Applied Physics, or a related field.
Publications, patents, open-source repos, or shipped products demonstrating impact in AI-for-chemistry or computational drug discovery are highly valued.




The role could be either based in Switzerland, the UK or the US.

Culture and values

We are guided by our shared values. It's not about finding people who think and act in the same way. These values help to guide our work and will continue to strengthen it.

Thoughtful

Thoughtful at Iso is about curiosity, creativity and care. It is about good people doing good, rigorous and future-making science every single day.

Brave

Brave at Iso is about fearlessness, but it’s also about initiative and integrity. The scale of the challenge demands nothing less.

Determined

Determined at Iso is the way we pursue our goal. It’s a confidence in our hypothesis, as well as the urgency and agility needed to deliver on it. Because disease won’t wait, so neither should we.

Together

Together at Iso is about connection, collaboration across fields and catalytic relationships. It’s knowing that transformation is a group project, and remembering that what we’re doing will have a real impact on real people everywhere.

Creating An Extraordinary Company

We believe that to be successful we need a team with a range of skills and talents. We're building an environment where collaboration is fundamental, learning is shared and every employee feels supported and able to thrive. We value unique experiences, knowledge, backgrounds, and perspectives, and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact.

We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Hybrid working

It’s hugely important for us to share knowledge and build strong relationships with each other, and we find it easier to do this if we spend time together in person. This is why we follow a hybrid model, and would require you to be able to come into the office 3 days a week (currently Tuesday, Wednesday, and one other day depending on which team you’re in). If you have additional needs that would prevent you from following this hybrid approach, we’d be happy to talk through these if you’re selected for an initial screening call.

Please note that when you submit an application, your data will be processed in line with our privacy policy.

DATA SCIENTIST – GENERATIVE AI SPECIALIST

Entra nel nostro mondo.

Trasforma insieme a noi.

Quale sarà la tua sfida?

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere.

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 6 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus.

Il/La Generative AI Specialist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze nei modelli di Generative AI, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in soluzioni e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi.

I/Le nostri/e Generative AI Specialists verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove per la maggior parte i dati sono non strutturati (testi, immagini, video, suoni) e il cui focus diventa la comprensione, il processamento e la generazione partendo da tali basi documentali altrimenti non processabili con le classiche tecniche di Data Science.

I contesti progettuali spaziano dall’utilizzo di modelli pre-addestrati (es. LLM) fino all’addestramento di nuovi modelli di Generative AI passando dal fine-tuning e absorption learning da modelli commerciali.

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Generative AI Specialist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.
