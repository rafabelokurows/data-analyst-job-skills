About Captain

Captain is a data analytics platform that enables brands and retailers to collaborate more effectively. By providing producers with the right insights and predictions, they can better manage how their products reach consumers. This is essential as we believe there are still too many inefficiencies in the supply chain.

‍

Over the past year, we’ve built a solid technical foundation and secured several leading clients, especially in the food industry. We’re currently expanding rapidly, backed by EU funding to develop models for price elasticity, demand forecasting, and assortment rationalization — all aimed at enabling data-driven category management.

‍

About the Role

This is a pivotal role for us — and can be for you too. We are looking for a Data Scientist with experience in Category Management, either on the retailer or supplier side. You will help us integrate complex data sources and build scalable models that create real value for our clients.

‍

Your work will focus on bringing together syndicated and proprietary datasets (e.g., Nielsen, Circana, GfK, SIS, 7EVEN, ex-factory) and transforming them into insights and predictions that help our clients win with retail. This role is both analytical and strategic — you’ll be closely involved in product development, pilot projects, and customer delivery.

‍

You’ll be working in a small, fast-moving team — which means you’ll get a lot of responsibility early on, but also have the chance to learn and grow quickly. You’ll be close to the decision-making and directly see the impact of your work on real client projects.

‍Your Profile
3+ years experience as a data scientist or analyst
Experience with category management data and workflows
Strong command of Python, SQL, and data visualization tools (e.g., Power BI)
Experience with price elasticity, forecasting, or clustering models
Comfortable working with messy, high-volume datasets
Fluent in English and Dutch

‍

Bonus points if you have:

FMCG experience at a supplier or retailer
Worked with assortment optimization or promo analytics
Familiarity with Azure, Databricks, or similar platforms

‍

What to Expect
Competitive salary between €4,250 and €5,000 per month (based on experience)
Employee stock option plan
One-year contract with permanent intent
25 vacation days
New MacBook
Mentorship and training budget
Hybrid work setup
Office in central Rotterdam (Microlab community)
Weekly team lunches and social events
Unlimited access to Udemy and Coursera

‍

Application Process

We keep it simple and personal. After your application, we’ll reach out for a conversation with our team. No unnecessary rounds — just a chance to get to know each other and explore fit.

‍

How to Apply

Apply directly through LinkedIn! We’re excited to hear how your experience in category management can help our clients grow — and how you want to grow with us.

Een mooie toekomst voor iedereen—dat is waar we bij Sopra Steria naartoe werken. Met meer dan 51.000 collega’s in bijna 30 landen zijn we één van de grootste leveranciers van digital solutions in Europa. We geloven dat niet enkel technologie transformatie aandrijft.

Vacatureomschrijving

Grote datasets bevatten waardevolle inzichten. Als data scientist zul je deze inzichten ontsluiten met behulp van je vaardigheid in programmeertalen zoals Python en R, evenals visualisatietools zoals Tableau en Power BI. Je zult deze inzichten communiceren naar stakeholders, zodat we die data kunnen omzetten in actie. Van jou wordt verwacht dat je de meest efficiënte oplossing analyseert en identificeert, terwijl je aandacht besteedt aan de details. Onze data scientists zijn bedreven in Hadoop & Spark, en cloudplatformen zoals AWS en Azure. Deze tools, gecombineerd met jouw data-expertise, zouden het bouwen van voorspellende modellen, het uitvoeren van hypothesetests en het doen van verkennende data-analyse tot een tweede natuur moeten maken.

Als Data Scientist bij Sopra Steria duik je de wereld van Kunstmatige Intelligentie (AI) in. Je past je vaardigheden toe op echte scenario's en in verschillende domeinen, zoals de ontdekking en analyse van betalingsstromen bij overheidsinstanties, fraudedetectie bij banken, de ontwikkeling van aanbevelingssystemen in de retailsector en de optimalisatie van toeleveringsketens.

We zijn actief in thema's zoals Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), AIOps en Uitlegbare AI (XAI). Je zult de ontwikkeling en implementatie van oplossingen met Machine Learning & Deep Learning bij onze klanten uitvoeren en de kwaliteit en prestaties van bestaande voorspellende modellen beoordelen, tot en met het in productie brengen en het behouden van deze modellen.

Functie-eisen

We zijn op zoek naar gepassioneerde collega’s die graag de grenzen van digitale transformatie en technologieconsulting verleggen. Bij Sopra Steria krijg je de kans om je vaardigheden verder te ontwikkelen in een constructieve, samenwerkende teamomgeving, waarbij je werkt aan impactvolle projecten die verandering teweegbrengen voor onze klanten. Als je gedijt in een uitdagende omgeving en voldoet (tenzij anders vermeld) aan de meeste kwalificaties hieronder, kijken we uit naar je sollicitatie!

De Kiesraad werkt voortdurend aan eerlijke, transparante en controleerbare verkiezingen. Data speelt hierin een belangrijke rol, bijvoorbeeld bij het controleerbaar maken van de verkiezingsuitslag.

Ben jij een softwareontwikkelaar die zich wil ontwikkelen op het terrein van data science? Of ben je juist een data scientist die het leuk vindt om software te ontwikkelen? Kom werken bij de Kiesraad en draag eraan bij dat we onze data optimaal benutten.

Samen met de data scientist en/of collega’s van andere afdelingen zet je data-gedreven onderzoeken op en voer je deze uit. Aan de hand van (historische) verkiezingsuitslagen help je mee richtlijnen op te stellen om afwijkende en/of opvallende verkiezingsuitslagen te identificeren. Hierbij werk je deels vraaggestuurd, maar ga je ook zelf op zoek naar potentieel interessante onderzoeksrichtingen.

Daarnaast help je met het bouwen van software om de bij de Kiesraad beschikbare data nog beter en transparanter te ontsluiten, bijvoorbeeld voor kiezers en onderzoekers. Je werkt mee aan de bouw van een nieuw uitslagenportaal. Hiermee kunnen kiezers tijdens een verkiezing alle data in het proces - van hun stem tot de uitslag - volgen en controleren. Ook werk je mee aan de doorontwikkeling en vernieuwing van onze databank met historische verkiezingsuitslagen.

Verder vind je het leuk om je te verdiepen in het brede kennisterrein van verkiezingen, en je krijgt hier de ruimte voor. Je wordt enthousiast van het kunnen vertalen van problemen uit de praktijk naar technische oplossingen of analyses, en vindt het leuk om hierin multidisciplinair te werken. Samen met deskundige professionals werk je binnen een unieke omgeving aan zowel een vitaal democratisch proces als je eigen ontwikkeling.

Je kunt gedeeltelijk vanuit huis werken, waarbij je minimaal twee dagen in de week op kantoor in Den Haag aanwezig zult zijn.

Functie-eisen


Je hebt hbo/wo-werk- en denkniveau;
Je hebt een technische IT-opleiding afgerond, bij voorkeur in de richting van data science of softwareontwikkeling;
Je hebt ervaring met het ontwikkelen van software (tijdens je opleiding of beroepsmatig);
Je hebt ervaring met Python en SQL voor analysedoeleinden. Ervaring met Rust, R of webframeworks is een pré;
Ervaring in het werken in een Agile omgeving en met bijbehorende tooling en processen is een pré;
Je bent communicatief vaardig (zowel in het Nederlands (minimaal niveau B2) als in het Engels), zowel schriftelijk als mondeling;
Je houdt van werken in multidisciplinaire teams en bent proactief in de samenwerking;
Ervaring met en/of kennis van het verkiezingsproces is een pré.


Competenties:


Klantgerichtheid
Analyseren
Resultaatgerichtheid
Samenwerken
Zelfontwikkeling


Bijzonderheden

De functie is onverenigbaar met iedere functie die tot gerede twijfel kan leiden over de onafhankelijke en onpartijdige oordeelsvorming van de Kiesraad.

About Us

We at Lumion make beautiful, high-performance desktop software for architectural visualization. Think: gorgeous buildings, smooth lighting, slick renders — the works. Now, we’re on a mission to develop some AI enhancements on top.

We're not trying to build the next ChatGPT or reinvent neural networks. We just want to make our app smarter — with clever, useful, jaw-droppingly cool features — using the powerful AI models already out there in the wild. That’s where you come in.




What You’ll Actually Do

You're not a lab researcher. You're a feature whisperer who knows how to make AI do things. You'll use open-source models (diffusion, GANs, vision transformers, etc.), evaluate a few APIs, glue things together, and help our users get magical results with minimal clicks.

Here are some things we’re dreaming about:

Turn a crappy photo into a stunning material.
Auto-generate textures or assets with zero human suffering.
Help users get better renders faster with upscaling, denoising, smart defaults.
Integrate AI into creative workflows without making it feel like AI is taking over the world (yet).




We’re Looking for Someone Who:

Has experience working with AI/ML in real-world, non-academic settings
Knows how to wrangle pre-trained models (PyTorch, ONNX, Hugging Face, etc.)
Loves building things, not just running experiments
Can work in Python, and ideally isn’t afraid of C++ (or people who use it)
Understands that “AI-enhanced” should never mean “mysteriously broken”
Bonus: You’ve played with 3D software, graphics pipelines, or materials/textures




Why You Might Like It Here

No infra-heavy LLM nonsense — just real features for real users
Small team, high trust, low politics
Ownership from day one: prototype, iterate, ship
We’re allergic to buzzwords, but not allergic to shipping cool stuff




How to Apply

You can apply directly through LinkedIn.

Send your CV and a short intro about your experience working with AI in real-world applications — especially if it involved image processing or visual tools. If you’ve prototyped anything cool, we’d love to see that too.




Friendly note:

Please do not make use of this vacancy as an acquisition opportunity.

Wij zoeken jou als Data Scientist bij Transavia

Als Data Scientist bij Transavia ontwikkel je een brede range aan advanced analytics- en ML/AI-oplossingen: van recommenders tot forecastingmodellen en decision support tools. Heb jij een passie voor slimme modellen en optimalisatiestrategieën? Wil jij de business slimmer laten werken en klanten beter bedienen met data-oplossingen? Dan zijn we op zoek naar jou!

Wat ga je doen?

In jouw nieuwe baan als Data Scientist werk je aan AI-, machine learning- en optimalisatie-oplossingen voor verschillende domeinen binnen Transavia, zoals operationele planning & scheduling, technische dienst, het operations control center en marketing & sales.

Binnen deze afdeling vormen we een belangrijke schakel tussen business en analytics en begeleiden we Transavia naar een meer datagedreven cultuur. We leiden de transformatie naar datagedreven werken, adviseren afdelingen aan de hand van informatie en inzichten, en ontwikkelen data- en AI-oplossingen voor klanten en medewerkers van Transavia. SDI bestaat uit drie verschillende teams met elk een eigen focus. We zoeken naar een Data Scientist voor het team wat zich richt op de operationele crew en flight bedrijfsprocessen.

Naast Data Scientists bestaan de teams uit Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Team leads en Expert Leads. Je zal veel samenwerken met jouw SDI collega’s, de business en onze (data) collega’s bij Transavia Frankrijk.

Dit krijg jij


Bruto maandsalaris tussen €4.083,- en €7.040,- op basis van een 40-urige werkweek;
Vakantietoeslag van 8% en een eindejaarsuitkering van 8,33%;
Reiskostenvergoeding;
Persoonlijk budget van €700,- om te werken aan jouw vitaliteit, bijvoorbeeld voor je sportabonnement, fiets of thuiswerkmateriaal;
Je start met 26 vakantiedagen op basis van een 40-urige werkweek.



Daarnaast bieden wij je ook nog:


Volop mogelijkheden om je te ontwikkelen. Via onze eigen Learning Hub kun je samen met je collega’s (online) trainingen volgen ten behoeve van je persoonlijke ontwikkeling;
(Team)coaching;
Flexibele werktijden en de mogelijkheid om een deel van je werkweek op kantoor en een deel vanuit huis te werken;
De optie om jaarlijks één erkende religieuze feestdag in te ruilen voor een niet-erkende religieuze feestdag;
Mogelijkheid tot deelname aan ‘Young Transavia’;
Last but not least; met onze IPB-regeling vlieg je tegen aantrekkelijke tarieven (indien plaats beschikbaar)!

Loop je weleens over de Zeedijk in Utrecht? Dan heb je ons misschien al gespot. Net naast koffiehuis Dagger, recht aan rivier de Vecht werken wij met 60-ish collega’s in de voormalige broodjesfabriek ‘de Lubro’. Daar maken we, bedenken we, knutselen we, experimenteren we, stickeren we, dansen we, eten we - en springt er soms iemand in een ballenbak. Of verandert het toilet in een discotheek. Wat we vooral in de Lubro doen, is zoveel mogelijk werk maken waar onze opdrachtgevers héél, héél blij van worden. En wij zelf ook.

Dit Krijg Je Bij Ons


Een uitdagend traineeship van 12 maanden met uitzicht op een vaste aanstelling
Persoonlijke begeleiding vanuit het development team, met persoonlijke ondersteuning

Een gepersonaliseerd platform voor Jumbo
Een verfrissende comeback van de 90's hit 'No Limit' voor VodafoneZiggo
Een carrière bij bol begint op dit platform dat wij maakten
Een AI-gedreven Career Coach op de site voor Team EIFFEL


We maken ook graag werk dat buiten de kaders van je computer- of telefoonscherm reikt:


Een AI photobooth die Redditors fascineert
Een WC waarmee we hard gingen op TikTok
Gamification voor gedetineerden
Een interactieve AI installatie die bier bedenkt

About Us

We are Xomnia, the AI consulting company. We’re curious problem solvers who believe data will change the way we live, work and communicate. Being at the forefront of this revolutionary change in a sustainable, positive way is what drives us.

We solve challenging data science and engineering projects, from start to finish. From developing an application for real-time fraud detection on Google Cloud Platform, to setting up a customized recommender engine in an existing Microsoft Azure environment - we develop and deploy tailor-made data science solutions.

Xomnia started in 2013 in one room in the heart of Amsterdam. These days we take up nearly two houses. But more than just a workspace, we're a community that values authenticity. Here, everyone is encouraged to be themselves, to learn, and to have fun in the process.

Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.




We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.

If you're experienced, passionate, and align with our values, we want to hear from you.

This job is right on the edge of Data Science and Business, and with your work we enable the business stakeholders to act on data.

Your daily action

Your job is to turn data into something useful. You’ll work in project teams with people from different departments. In these teams, you are the expert in data and smart solutions. You’ll also work on ideas from your own team to try new things or improve the way we work. This helps Action, your team, and your own growth.

What will you do?


You build smart models (machine learning) that help with planning. For example, to predict how many people are needed or to help improve workflows.
You create simulations. These are like test runs that show what happens when something changes. This helps us see if a new idea will actually work—like a new way of storing products in the warehouse.
You make clever math models to figure out the best and most efficient way to do things. One example is a tool that shows the best walking routes in the warehouse.
You do research with data (statistics) to find out what’s going well and what can be better. For example: does warehouse traffic slow people down? And how can we fix that?
You work closely with others to spot opportunities and make clear plans. You help figure out what’s needed and how to get it done.

Working in Action means working in a dynamic and highly motivated environment that is constantly looking for improvements. As a team we support a wide variety of stakeholders and our mission is to transform Action’s data into value for them. Can we for example predict by means of ML what’s coming so they can prepare for it. Or can we predict by means of discrete event simulations what’s happening if they would change something in their process designs. Or can we offer by means of mathematical optimization an optimal solution for processing a batch of workload in a warehouse. Since there are more data- scientists and analysts working in the team you can team up with experience and knowledge to achieve the best results for Action and learn from each other.

This is you

You are passionate about taking Data Science to the next level. With strong analytical skills, you turn business questions into mathematical models that deliver real value. You understand key business drivers and translate complex data into actionable insights. You present these clearly and work well with others to reach shared goals. You’re pragmatic, communicative, and fluent in English.

You also have:


A master’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g. Operations Research, Econometrics, Business Analytics)
5+ years of experience as a data scientist
Experience with machine learning models (e.g. clustering, forecasting, classification, regression)
Experience with simulation and optimization models (e.g. discrete-event modeling, heuristics, linear programming)
Experience working with large datasets
Proficiency in PySpark, Python, SQL; C++ is a plus
Experience with Azure (e.g. Databricks, Workflows, Container Registries, MLflow)


What we offer


Annual bonus scheme based on personal and company targets.
24 paid holidays and the opportunity to buy up to 5 additional holidays;
Commuting allowance;
Company laptop and mobile phone;

We zijn op zoek naar een ML Engineer die ons gaat helpen bij het oplossen van waardevolle business uitdagingen voor KLM's Operations afdeling, door het bouwen van innovatieve data science en ML oplossingen. Je werkt samen met Data Scientists en Machine Learning Engineers van de afdeling Operation Decision Support (ODS). De kernfocus van ODS is het optimaliseren van processen rondom vloot, bemanning en gronddiensten. Onze modellen zijn gericht op het beantwoorden van zeer relevante vragen zoals:

Hoeveel maaltijden zijn er nodig aan boord?
Hoeveel grondpersoneel is er nodig en op welk tijdstip?
Hoeveel no-shows kunnen we verwachten op deze vlucht?
Hoeveel vertraging zal een vlucht oplopen en hoe kunnen we de impact minimaliseren?




De antwoorden op deze vragen hebben direct invloed op de operaties van KLM, wat betekent dat er volop mogelijkheden zijn om te werken aan projecten die daadwerkelijk kosten besparen en/of inkomsten verhogen. Naast het bijdragen aan deze spannende projecten, zijn er mogelijkheden om:

Werken aan een innovatieproject in KickstartAI (kickstartai.nl);
Je nieuwste learnings te presenteren op een van onze Data Science Community events of tijdens onze wekelijkse kennisdelingssessies.




We zijn nu op zoek naar uitbreiding van onze Machine Learning mogelijkheden. Wil je de voorspellingen van je model in actie zien de volgende keer dat je een vlucht neemt?




Wat ga je doen?

Als ML Engineer kom je te werken in een groeiend agile Machine Learning team, momenteel bestaande uit 4 ML Engineers, 6 Data Scientists en 2 Business Consultants / Product Owners. Het team is volledig opgenomen in de afdeling en onze modellen zullen ondersteunen en adviseren op operationeel en tactisch niveau. Belangrijke aspecten van je dagelijkse werk zijn:




Werken aan voorspellingsmodellen, die 24/7 gebruikt worden in de live operaties van KLM. Deze modellen helpen je collega's bij de maaltijdvoorziening aan boord of bij de personeelsplanning in de terminals;
De volledige ML-pijplijn ontwerpen, onderzoeken en implementeren, van hertraining tot modelimplementatie en -monitoring
De geproduceerde ML-modellen voortdurend bewaken en verbeteren.
Aangezien KLM momenteel migreert naar Google Cloud Platform, ben jij een van de experts om onze cloudimplementatie tot een succes te maken.
Toezicht houden op de datapijplijn van ML-modellen
Nauw samenwerken met data scientists en data engineers
Je beste lessen delen op een Data Science Community-evenement
Plezier hebben en genieten terwijl je het doet!




Je wordt ook aangemoedigd en verwacht dat je 15-20% van je tijd bij ons besteedt aan het leren van nieuwe dingen, het doen van onderzoek en jezelf ontwikkelen. Dit kun je doen door cursussen te volgen, papers te lezen of coole hack-projecten te doen met je collega's. De projecten die je doet in je 15-20% tijd moeten gerelateerd zijn aan je functie, maar hoeven niet gerelateerd te zijn aan de projecten waar je normaal gesproken aan werkt.




Waar land je?

Je werkt op een hybride manier, deels vanuit huis en deels vanuit het kantoor op Schiphol-Oost, waar je de vliegtuigen kunt zien opstijgen terwijl je dockercontainer wordt gebouwd. We hebben flexibele werktijden en kantoordagen, dus we vinden wel iets wat bij je past. Het team is onderdeel van de grotere Operations Decision Support (ODS) afdeling, waar je ook nauw samenwerkt met andere data teams die gespecialiseerd zijn in bijvoorbeeld Operational Research of Data Engineering.




Jouw profiel

We hebben gemerkt dat mensen die aan de volgende eisen voldoen het beste bij ons passen:

Technisch onderlegd met gevoel voor logica, wiskunde en statistiek.
Ondernemend, analytisch, creatief en resultaatgericht.
Goed in het uitleggen van technische oplossingen in lekentaal.
Leergierig en op de hoogte van de nieuwste technologieën op het gebied van machine learning.




De vaardigheden en ervaring die je inbrengt in het team:

Een masterdiploma (of hoger) in Informatica, Data Science, Kunstmatige Intelligentie, Econometrie of een aanverwant vakgebied.
2 jaar ervaring in softwareontwikkeling.
Ten minste 1 jaar ervaring in het werken met Data Science/Machine Learning-teams.
Aantoonbare ervaring met het ontwikkelen van MLOps-pijplijnen, inclusief implementatie, monitoring en hertraining.
Sterke basis in software engineering met expertise in Object Georiënteerd Programmeren (OOP) principes en design patterns.
Ervaring met het schrijven van Python-code op productieniveau, inclusief best practices in CI/CD, testgestuurde ontwikkeling en codeoptimalisatie.
Ervaring met ten minste één grote Cloud provider.
Ervaring met Git, Unix shell, REST API's, Docker, Kubernetes, Kibana, Prometheus, Grafana, (py)Spark, SQL, Terraform en andere relevante tools is een pré.
Ervaring met Large Language Models (LLM's) en Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is een pré.




Competenties

Initiatief

Mondeling communiceren

Probleemanalyse

Samenwerken




Wat bieden wij?

Een brutosalaris tussen €4.252,77 en €6.075,38 bruto per maand;
Volop ruimte voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling en mooie doorgroeimogelijkheden;
Een uitstekende pensioenregeling en 8% vakantiegeld;
Een eindejaarsuitkering van 8,33%;
Een regeling voor winstdeling, tot 20%;
25 vakantiedagen en 5 extra vrije dagen;
Fikse korting op vliegtickets (als je minimaal 6 maanden in dienst bent);
Een duurzaam vervoersbeleid, met o.a. 100% gratis reizen naar het werk met het Openbaar Vervoer (binnen Nederland);
Als je functie dit toelaat: thuiswerken en tot 8 weken werken vanuit het buitenland (EU en Caribisch gebied);
2% vrij te besteden ontwikkelbudget;




Ready for your next destination?

Wacht dan niet langer, en solliciteer voor de ‘final boarding call’ op 03-06-2025! Je hoeft geen motivatiebrief te schrijven; tijdens je online sollicitatie stellen we je enkele gerichte vragen. Je sollicitatieprocedure bestaat uit twee gesprekken en mogelijk een assessment, capaciteitentest en een veiligheidsonderzoek. Binnen twee weken na sluitingsdatum van de vacature krijg je bericht van ons.




Wist je dat volgens onderzoek vrouwen minder graag solliciteren dan mannen, als ze niet aan alle functie-eisen voldoen? Zonde. Want ‘de perfecte kandidaat’ is wat ons betreft een fabeltje. Dus heb jij de drive om op enkele aspecten in deze rol nog te groeien? We kijken uit naar je sollicitatie.




Een dossiercheck (voor ex-KLM-medewerkers) en/of een referentiecheck kunnen onderdeel uitmaken van de sollicitatieprocedure. Door te solliciteren op deze vacature geef je toestemming voor deze checks.

As a Machine Learning Engineer, you collaborate with Data Scientists and Data Engineers to develop scalable, production-ready applications powered by data and AI. You are a Scientist or Engineer who embraces mathematics and understands the process of taking models from development to production. You possess the necessary skills and courage to bring ideas from your laptop to a cluster.




How you will help in creating value with Data & AI

At Xebia, we establish robust Data & AI practices to bring value to our clients and their customers. Our team of data professionals has successfully predicted daily bread demand, implemented energy-saving algorithms at a national scale, and established data innovation labs in large multinational corporations. By joining our team, you can contribute to even greater achievements in making top companies AI-driven.

As a machine learning engineer, your responsibility is to take AI solutions into production to generate value. You ensure that applications are scalable, testable, robust, and extendable through your expertise in engineering and machine learning.




What you will do to make AI-driven applications

You collaborate closely with data scientists on your team to understand the problem being addressed and their approach. You review their code, modularise it, identify areas for testing, and even challenge their solutions to enhance their effectiveness. Your proficiency in Python enables you to improve code quality or potentially translate it to other languages like Scala or Java.

During on-site client engagements, you may encounter challenging problems. Fortunately, Xebia organizes regular remote work sessions where you can discuss and find solutions with the collective intelligence of the entire team. If immediate assistance is needed, every Xebia member is just a quick message away, always ready to provide support.




THIS IS YOUR DREAM JOB IF…

✅ You like working on the overlap between AI and software or data engineering.

✅ You like building your solutions with services on public clouds or want to learn how to do that.

✅ You like working for different clients and enjoy the excitement of regularly getting to learn new environments and know new people.

✅ You speak Dutch fluently.




THIS IS NOT YOUR DREAM JOB IF…

❌ You only want to build models from data and are not interested in doing the work involved in taking these models into production.

❌ You are just fine with spaghetti code or do not understand what that is.

❌ You do not like coding, scripting, or templating.




WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A CONSULTANT AT XEBIA DATA

As a consultant at Xebia Data, you will have projects of varying lengths. Some are 2 weeks, some are 1 year, most are in between. Every project is different, as is every client. We, however, always deliver the best quality possible. It is not always easy, but it is always rewarding. You will be exposed to different companies, problems, systems, and solutions. Join our dynamic team and collaborate with industry leaders such as Ahold, ASML, Sligro, and Vattenfall! Explore the exciting projects we've undertaken by diving into our inspiring customer stories.




You will be surrounded by experts in different fields, and you will learn so many new things in a short time. Xebia Data offers the perfect environment to shine as a data professional.

You will never be alone on this journey. We have all experienced imposter syndrome, had a difficult project, or felt down at times. We know what it takes, we know it is difficult sometimes, and we will be there for you when you need it. We say People First, and we mean it.




Xebia Data offers you great benefits too, of course!

You can enjoy, for free, healthy lunches and not-so-healthy drinks/snacks at our offices.
You can use the great benefits we offer for your physical and mental well-being.
You get a generous tech budget.
You can build/test/experiment anything you want in our sandbox environments in GCP, AWS and Azure.
You can work on that innovative idea of yours during the monthly Xebia Data Fridays.
You have 5.000 Euros and 6 days of development budget per year which you can spend on anything that will make you a better data professional.
You also have a monthly mobility budget to spend on leasing a car, leasing the e-bike of your dreams, or getting an NS Business Card.

By ensuring our investments deliver maximum value for 13.5 million customers. You’ll shape how we optimize and prioritize initiatives across our 1,400-strong Product & Tech organization. Using sophisticated analytical tooling and methods, you’ll enable leadership to make data-driven resource investment decisions that have a real impact. As such, you demonstrably influence how we evolve our product portfolio to maximize our ROI.

The biggest challenge

Navigating complex trade-offs in a fast-moving environment where priorities constantly evolve. Success means developing robust analytical frameworks that help us allocate resources to the highest-impact initiatives. You must also ensure we retain the agility to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions. You’ll work alongside one colleague analyst and four portfolio managers on the team. How can you translate vast amounts of data into clear strategic recommendations – even when faced with uncertainty or incomplete information?

What you’ll do as an Economist - Portfolio Management

As part of our newly established Portfolio Management team, you’ll be the primary data expert at the intersection of data science, economics, and product analytics. Working closely with product analysts, engineers, product managers, finance teams, and commercial leads, you’ll ensure data-driven decisions determine our product and technology investments.

Responsibilities

Your analyses will span our entire product portfolio, identifying relationships between product groups, business metrics, and financial outcomes. You’ll develop sophisticated models using causal inference methods and ML to measure initiative impact and build scalable frameworks that drive decision-making. Perhaps most importantly, you’ll translate complex findings into clear, actionable insights for senior stakeholders. Key responsibilities:


Lead the analysis of relationships between product performance and business outcomes
Define and track portfolio KPIs to evaluate investment effectiveness
Build predictive models and dashboards that drive better decision-making
Assess business cases using rigorous statistical methods
Apply causal inference techniques to measure strategic initiative impact
Partner with Product, Finance, and Commercial teams to shape investment strategies
Transform complex analyses into clear leadership recommendations


Why you can make a difference

Because you combine advanced analytical expertise with solid business acumen and communication skills. With an MSc, MPhil, or PhD in Economics, Econometrics, Applied Statistics, or Data Science, and at least 2 years (PhD) or 4 years (Master’s) of hands-on experience in a product-led organization, you bring both the theoretical and practical aspects of data-driven decision-making. Your technical toolkit includes Python/R for advanced statistical modeling (including causal inference methods like difference-in-differences and synthetic controls), SQL for data manipulation, and cloud platforms like BigQuery. Experience with modern data engineering tools (Git, dbt, Airflow) is a plus, as is prior experience in tech or e-commerce.

We recognize that expertise comes in many forms. If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply! We value diverse perspectives and believe the right mindset and the willingness to learn are just as important as checking every box.

3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


- Modeling mayhem Correlation does not imply causation!
- Stakeholder shy You wish the data would do a better job of speaking for itself
- Analysis avoider You prefer delegating the number crunching to ""the data people""
+ Statistically business-savvy You combine deep statistical expertise with keen business instincts
+ Pragmatic modeler You find creative ways to deliver insights, even when working with imperfect data
+ Organizational navigator You enjoy building bridges across teams to drive data-driven decisions

          <strong>How do you make our customers happy? <br><br></strong>By ensuring our investments deliver maximum value for 13.5 million customers. You’ll shape how we optimize and prioritize initiatives across our 1,400-strong Product &amp; Tech organization. Using sophisticated analytical tooling and methods, you’ll enable leadership to make data-driven resource investment decisions that have a real impact. As such, you demonstrably influence how we evolve our product portfolio to maximize our ROI.<br><br><strong> The biggest challenge <br><br></strong>Navigating complex trade-offs in a fast-moving environment where priorities constantly evolve. Success means developing robust analytical frameworks that help us allocate resources to the highest-impact initiatives. You must also ensure we retain the agility to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions. You’ll work alongside one colleague analyst and four portfolio managers on the team. How can you translate vast amounts of data into clear strategic recommendations – even when faced with uncertainty or incomplete information?<br><br><strong> What you’ll do as an Economist - Portfolio Management <br><br></strong>As part of our newly established Portfolio Management team, you’ll be the primary data expert at the intersection of data science, economics, and product analytics. Working closely with product analysts, engineers, product managers, finance teams, and commercial leads, you’ll ensure data-driven decisions determine our product and technology investments.<br><br><strong>Responsibilities<br><br></strong>Your analyses will span our entire product portfolio, identifying relationships between product groups, business metrics, and financial outcomes. You’ll develop sophisticated models using causal inference methods and ML to measure initiative impact and build scalable frameworks that drive decision-making. Perhaps most importantly, you’ll translate complex findings into clear, actionable insights for senior stakeholders. Key responsibilities:<br><br><ul><li> Lead the analysis of relationships between product performance and business outcomes </li><li> Define and track portfolio KPIs to evaluate investment effectiveness </li><li> Build predictive models and dashboards that drive better decision-making </li><li> Assess business cases using rigorous statistical methods </li><li> Apply causal inference techniques to measure strategic initiative impact </li><li> Partner with Product, Finance, and Commercial teams to shape investment strategies </li><li> Transform complex analyses into clear leadership recommendations <br><br></li></ul><strong> Why you can make a difference <br><br></strong>Because you combine advanced analytical expertise with solid business acumen and communication skills. With an MSc, MPhil, or PhD in Economics, Econometrics, Applied Statistics, or Data Science, <strong>and at least 2 years (PhD) or 4 years (Master’s) of hands-on experience in a product-led organization</strong>, you bring both the theoretical and practical aspects of data-driven decision-making. Your technical toolkit includes Python/R for advanced statistical modeling (including causal inference methods like difference-in-differences and synthetic controls), SQL for data manipulation, and cloud platforms like BigQuery. Experience with modern data engineering tools (Git, dbt, Airflow) is a plus, as is prior experience in tech or e-commerce.<br><br>We recognize that expertise comes in many forms. If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply! We value diverse perspectives and believe the right mindset and the willingness to learn are just as important as checking every box.<br><br><strong>3 reasons why this is (not) for you</strong> <strong>Switch to find out<br><br></strong><ul><li> - Modeling mayhem Correlation does not imply causation! </li><li> - Stakeholder shy You wish the data would do a better job of speaking for itself </li><li> - Analysis avoider You prefer delegating the number crunching to ""the data people"" </li><li> + Statistically business-savvy You combine deep statistical expertise with keen business instincts </li><li> + Pragmatic modeler You find creative ways to deliver insights, even when working with imperfect data </li><li> + Organizational navigator You enjoy building bridges across teams to drive data-driven decisions <br><br></li></ul><strong> Where you'll work <br><br></strong>You’ll join our newly established Portfolio Management team, working alongside four portfolio managers who combine analytical rigor with business pragmatism.

Bol.com is changing retail to make daily life simpler for 13 million Dutch and Belgian customers. We are joined on this mission by 52,000 partner sellers that do business on our retail tech platform. This represents a combined assortment of approximately 42 million products. And each of these products needs to be onboarded quickly, efficiently and flawlessly into the product catalog. A complex endeavor because product information comes in many shapes and sizes. So how do we rationalize and automate that process?

What you do as Data Scientist in Traffic Management?

Are you a passionate explorer of the data universe, driven by the thrill of uncovering hidden insights and patterns? Do you have a keen eye for turning raw data into actionable information? If so, we invite you to embark on a data-driven adventure with us as a Data Scientist.

Team Value Steering is looking for a Senior Data Scientist to help us unlock valuable insights for various projects.

Currently we are working on an exciting new project: Value steering. For this project we are in an exploration phase to steer PBM towards both GMV and profit.

The new Data Scientist in the team would continue these explorations to create insights/rules/models that we can use in production, with a huge potential impact on the efficiency of our marketing budget.

Why you can make the difference

To be successful as a Data Scientist in the Traffic Product, you obviously need the right credentials, such as a background in Data Science (AI or equivalent) and at least 3 years of relevant work experience. This ideally comprises a mix of Machine Learning / Deep Learning, A/B testing experience and NLP / Information Retrieval techniques. We also expect a proven ability to program in Python and write queries in SQL and BigQuery . Bonus points are awarded for Data engineering experience (ETL and Airflow), Cloud solutions and Google’s AI platform experience. On a more personal level, we highly value a strong drive to help people with wildly diverging backgrounds and skill sets to understand your models, as well as strong social skills. Moreover, the team loves to share, both ‘internally’ and with the broader Data Science community. If you share that mentality, great!

3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


- No if your attention span plummets after the POC phase
- No if neural nets are your answer to anything and everything
- No if you like flying solo #allthatairspaceismiiiiiiiiiiine!
+ Yes if you are keen to collaborate with the engineers in your team: they build what you envision, so the closer the bonds, the better
+ Yes if mixing and mingling with the Product Catalogue crowd is your thing: you are eager to spread the Data Science word
+ Yes if you feel responsible for turning ideas into realities


This is where you’ll work

At the premier online retail tech platform in the Netherlands and Belgium. A platform where 13 million Dutch and Belgian customers can choose from over 35 million articles. A platform that helps roughly 52,000 commercial partners run their business. And a platform that will never be ‘finished’, because bol.com has been reinventing retail since 1999 and we always will be. If there’s a better way to do something, we’re working on it! Together with our customers, partners, and about 3000 colleagues. And hopefully together with you! In this role, you work closely with our Product Managerand Software Engineers with a focus on ML solutions.

We take pride in our B Corp certification and strive for continuous improvement every day. Our annual bonus is tied to sustainability goals, and we are committed to equality and equal opportunities for all.

We zijn op zoek naar een ML Engineer die ons gaat helpen bij het oplossen van waardevolle business uitdagingen voor KLM's Operations afdeling, door het bouwen van innovatieve data science en ML oplossingen. Je werkt samen met Data Scientists en Machine Learning Engineers van de afdeling Operation Decision Support (ODS). De kernfocus van ODS is het optimaliseren van processen rondom vloot, bemanning en gronddiensten. Onze modellen zijn gericht op het beantwoorden van zeer relevante vragen zoals:

Hoeveel maaltijden zijn er nodig aan boord?
Hoeveel grondpersoneel is er nodig en op welk tijdstip?
Hoeveel no-shows kunnen we verwachten op deze vlucht?
Hoeveel vertraging zal een vlucht oplopen en hoe kunnen we de impact minimaliseren?




De antwoorden op deze vragen hebben direct invloed op de operaties van KLM, wat betekent dat er volop mogelijkheden zijn om te werken aan projecten die daadwerkelijk kosten besparen en/of inkomsten verhogen. Naast het bijdragen aan deze spannende projecten, zijn er mogelijkheden om:

Werken aan een innovatieproject in KickstartAI (kickstartai.nl);
Je nieuwste learnings te presenteren op een van onze Data Science Community events of tijdens onze wekelijkse kennisdelingssessies.




We zijn nu op zoek naar uitbreiding van onze Machine Learning mogelijkheden. Wil je de voorspellingen van je model in actie zien de volgende keer dat je een vlucht neemt?




Wat ga je doen?

Als ML Engineer kom je te werken in een groeiend agile Machine Learning team, momenteel bestaande uit 4 ML Engineers, 6 Data Scientists en 2 Business Consultants / Product Owners. Het team is volledig opgenomen in de afdeling en onze modellen zullen ondersteunen en adviseren op operationeel en tactisch niveau. Belangrijke aspecten van je dagelijkse werk zijn:




Werken aan voorspellingsmodellen, die 24/7 gebruikt worden in de live operaties van KLM. Deze modellen helpen je collega's bij de maaltijdvoorziening aan boord of bij de personeelsplanning in de terminals;
De volledige ML-pijplijn ontwerpen, onderzoeken en implementeren, van hertraining tot modelimplementatie en -monitoring
De geproduceerde ML-modellen voortdurend bewaken en verbeteren.
Aangezien KLM momenteel migreert naar Google Cloud Platform, ben jij een van de experts om onze cloudimplementatie tot een succes te maken.
Toezicht houden op de datapijplijn van ML-modellen
Nauw samenwerken met data scientists en data engineers
Je beste lessen delen op een Data Science Community-evenement
Plezier hebben en genieten terwijl je het doet!




Je wordt ook aangemoedigd en verwacht dat je 15-20% van je tijd bij ons besteedt aan het leren van nieuwe dingen, het doen van onderzoek en jezelf ontwikkelen. Dit kun je doen door cursussen te volgen, papers te lezen of coole hack-projecten te doen met je collega's. De projecten die je doet in je 15-20% tijd moeten gerelateerd zijn aan je functie, maar hoeven niet gerelateerd te zijn aan de projecten waar je normaal gesproken aan werkt.




Waar land je?

Je werkt op een hybride manier, deels vanuit huis en deels vanuit het kantoor op Schiphol-Oost, waar je de vliegtuigen kunt zien opstijgen terwijl je dockercontainer wordt gebouwd. We hebben flexibele werktijden en kantoordagen, dus we vinden wel iets wat bij je past. Het team is onderdeel van de grotere Operations Decision Support (ODS) afdeling, waar je ook nauw samenwerkt met andere data teams die gespecialiseerd zijn in bijvoorbeeld Operational Research of Data Engineering.




Jouw profiel

We hebben gemerkt dat mensen die aan de volgende eisen voldoen het beste bij ons passen:

Technisch onderlegd met gevoel voor logica, wiskunde en statistiek.
Ondernemend, analytisch, creatief en resultaatgericht.
Goed in het uitleggen van technische oplossingen in lekentaal.
Leergierig en op de hoogte van de nieuwste technologieën op het gebied van machine learning.




De vaardigheden en ervaring die je inbrengt in het team:

Een masterdiploma (of hoger) in Informatica, Data Science, Kunstmatige Intelligentie, Econometrie of een aanverwant vakgebied.
2 jaar ervaring in softwareontwikkeling.
Ten minste 1 jaar ervaring in het werken met Data Science/Machine Learning-teams.
Aantoonbare ervaring met het ontwikkelen van MLOps-pijplijnen, inclusief implementatie, monitoring en hertraining.
Sterke basis in software engineering met expertise in Object Georiënteerd Programmeren (OOP) principes en design patterns.
Ervaring met het schrijven van Python-code op productieniveau, inclusief best practices in CI/CD, testgestuurde ontwikkeling en codeoptimalisatie.
Ervaring met ten minste één grote Cloud provider.
Ervaring met Git, Unix shell, REST API's, Docker, Kubernetes, Kibana, Prometheus, Grafana, (py)Spark, SQL, Terraform en andere relevante tools is een pré.
Ervaring met Large Language Models (LLM's) en Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is een pré.




Competenties

Initiatief

Mondeling communiceren

Probleemanalyse

Samenwerken




Wat bieden wij?

Een brutosalaris tussen €4.252,77 en €6.075,38 bruto per maand;
Volop ruimte voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling en mooie doorgroeimogelijkheden;
Een uitstekende pensioenregeling en 8% vakantiegeld;
Een eindejaarsuitkering van 8,33%;
Een regeling voor winstdeling, tot 20%;
25 vakantiedagen en 5 extra vrije dagen;
Fikse korting op vliegtickets (als je minimaal 6 maanden in dienst bent);
Een duurzaam vervoersbeleid, met o.a. 100% gratis reizen naar het werk met het Openbaar Vervoer (binnen Nederland);
Als je functie dit toelaat: thuiswerken en tot 8 weken werken vanuit het buitenland (EU en Caribisch gebied);
2% vrij te besteden ontwikkelbudget;




Ready for your next destination?

Wacht dan niet langer, en solliciteer voor de ‘final boarding call’ op 03-06-2025! Je hoeft geen motivatiebrief te schrijven; tijdens je online sollicitatie stellen we je enkele gerichte vragen. Je sollicitatieprocedure bestaat uit twee gesprekken en mogelijk een assessment, capaciteitentest en een veiligheidsonderzoek. Binnen twee weken na sluitingsdatum van de vacature krijg je bericht van ons.




Wist je dat volgens onderzoek vrouwen minder graag solliciteren dan mannen, als ze niet aan alle functie-eisen voldoen? Zonde. Want ‘de perfecte kandidaat’ is wat ons betreft een fabeltje. Dus heb jij de drive om op enkele aspecten in deze rol nog te groeien? We kijken uit naar je sollicitatie.




Een dossiercheck (voor ex-KLM-medewerkers) en/of een referentiecheck kunnen onderdeel uitmaken van de sollicitatieprocedure. Door te solliciteren op deze vacature geef je toestemming voor deze checks.

Unternehmensprofil

„Am Anfang schaute ich mich um, konnte aber den Wagen, von dem ich träumte, nicht finden. Also beschloss ich, ihn mir selbst zu bauen.“

Dieser Satz von Ferry Porsche bringt alles auf den Punkt, was Porsche ausmacht. Als Marke, als Unternehmen, als Automobilhersteller, als Arbeitgeber. Die „Idee Porsche“ hat so einzigartige Sportwagen wie den Porsche 356 oder den 911 hervorgebracht. Durch die Kombination von Tradition und Innovation mit den Porsche typischen, manchmal etwas unkonventionellen Denkweisen unserer Mitarbeiter, lassen wir automobile Träume wahr werden und haben so immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick. Porsche ist allerdings viel mehr als ""nur"" ein exklusiver Sportwagenhersteller. Denn auch als Arbeitgeber hat Porsche viel zu bieten: vielfältige Einstiegs- und Karrieremöglichkeiten, Maßnahmen zur Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie sowie flexible Arbeitszeitmodelle.

Exklusive Einblicke hinter die Kulissen

Unabhängig von dem, was andere tun, sind wir stets bestrebt, unsere Grenzen ständig neu zu definieren und Maßstäbe zu setzen. Das können wir heute und in Zukunft aber nur mit Mitarbeitern und Führungskräften erreichen, die immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick haben.

Exklusive Einblicke in die Porsche Arbeitswelt erhalten Sie auch auf unseren Karriereprofilen in den sozialen Netzwerken:

Full-Stack-Entwicklung und Embedded Systems

 

Gestalte mit uns die Zukunft der Zustandsüberwachung im Stromnetz

Bei der BSS Hochspannungstechnik GmbH entwickeln wir innovative Monitoring-Systeme und Sensoren zur Zustandsüberwachung von Transformatoren und anderen Betriebsmitteln im Energienetz. Unsere Technologie unterstützt Netzbetreiber weltweit dabei, erneuerbare Energien sicher zu integrieren und die Netzstabilität zu sichern.

Wir suchen Softwareentwickler, die Lust auf moderne Technologien, enge Verzahnung mit der Hardware-Entwicklung und echten Gestaltungsspielraum haben – ob erfahrene Profis oder motivierte Talente.

Als junges Unternehmen mit gefestigter Marktposition und starkem Wachstum bieten wir dir die Chance, Prozesse aktiv mitzugestalten und deine Karriere langfristig zu entwickeln.




Deine Aufgaben:

Embedded & Cloud: Wirke aktiv an der Softwareentwicklung für unsere Embedded Systeme (Frontend/Backend) mit und trage zur Gestaltung unserer Cloud-Anwendung bei.
Teamarbeit: Im engen Austausch mit Hardware-Entwicklung, Produktion, Qualitätssicherung, Vertrieb und Support bringst du deine Ideen ein. Deine Perspektive hilft uns, Anforderungen zu schärfen und unsere Software erfolgreich zu verbessern.
Automatisierung: Unterstütze die Optimierung unserer Produktion, indem du an der Entwicklung cleverer Software-Tools für automatisierte Konfiguration und Routinetests mitwirkst.
Qualität & Dokumentation: Trage durch deine Mitarbeit bei Teststrategien, deine Teilnahme an Code-Reviews und eine sorgfältige Dokumentation aktiv zur hohen Qualität und Stabilität unserer Software bei.




Dein Profil:

Erfahrung: Du bringst mehrjährige Berufserfahrung in der Softwareentwicklung mit, davon mindestens in einem der Bereiche Web-Entwicklung oder Embedded Systems.
Kernkompetenzen: Du beherrschst Python sicher und hast praktische Erfahrung mit JavaScript sowie modernen Frontend-Frameworks wie Vue.js (oder Alternativen wie React, Angular).
Von Vorteil: Kenntnisse im Umgang mit Linux/Yocto oder C sind ein Pluspunkt.
Qualitätsbewusstsein: Du legst Wert auf eine saubere, gut strukturierte und wartbare Implementierung. Erfahrung im Aufbau von Softwaretests, dem Erstellen von Dokumentationen und der Durchführung von Code-Reviews bringst du mit.
Motivation & Mindset: Du bist motiviert, dich kontinuierlich in neue Technologien einzuarbeiten. Du bist ein Teamplayer mit einer lösungsorientierten Denkweise.

Das bieten wir dir:

Gestaltungsspielraum: Ein abwechslungsreiches Tätigkeitsfeld mit großem Einflussbereich und flachen Hierarchien.
Flexibilität: Flexible Arbeitszeiten zur optimalen Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Privatleben.
Effizienz & Kultur: Schnelle Entscheidungswege und eine offene, kollegiale Unternehmenskultur.
 Vergütung & Zusatzleistungen: Attraktive Bezahlung inklusive jährlicher Gewinnbeteiligung sowie zusätzliche Benefits wie ein steuerfreier Tankgutschein.
Wachstum & Perspektive: Ein modernes, wachsendes Arbeitsumfeld mit langfristigen Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten.




Bei uns darf und soll sich jeder einbringen, wir leben Teamgeist und Offenheit. Wo andernorts flache Hierarchien künstlich eingeführt werden, leben wir sie ganz natürlich von Anfang an. Deine Stimme hat genauso viel Wert wie die der anderen. In kleinen, engagierten Teams entwickeln, testen, diskutieren und lachen wir gemeinsam. Klingt nach deinem nächsten Job?

Wir freuen uns auf deine Bewerbung!

DerBosch Health Campusvereint alle Institutionen und Förderaktivitäten der Robert Bosch Stiftung im Bereich Gesundheit. „Behandeln. Forschen. Bilden. Fördern.“ - Dieser Mission folgt der Campus mit seinen Einrichtungen für eine zukunfts- und patientenorientierte Gesundheitsversorgung. Es erwarten Sie ein abwechslungsreiches Arbeitsumfeld mit Schwerpunkt Förder- und Forschungsaktivitäten, vielfältige Themen sowie ein engagiertes und freundliches Team.

Weitere Informationen zum Bosch Health Campus:www.bosch-health-campus.de

Das Programm

Das Robert Bosch Centrum für Innovation im Gesundheitswesen fördert im Rahmen einer Partnerschaft zwischen dem Bosch Health Campus Stuttgart (koordiniert durch den Bosch Digital Innovation Hub (BDIH)) und der ETH Zürich (koordiniert durch das ETH AI Center) gemeinsame KI-Forschungsstipendien für Nachwuchswissenschaftler (m/w/d). Mit dem Stipendienprogramm wollen die beiden Einrichtungen innovative Ansätze in der KI-Forschung entwickeln und so die Gesundheitsversorgung der Zukunft verbessern.

Das Centrum für Medizinische Datenintegration

Das Centrum für Medizinische Datenintegration (meDIC) hat zum Ziel, die vielfältigen klinischen Daten der Regelversorgung am Robert Bosch Krankenhaus für die medizinische Forschung zugänglich zu machen. Hierzu werden technische Lösungen erarbeitet sowie organisatorische und regulatorische Rahmenbedingungen geschaffen. Das meDIC übernimmt damit sowohl eine verbindende Rolle zwischen Medizin und Informatik, als auch zwischen klinischer Behandlung und medizinischer Forschung. Als zentrale Einrichtung am BHC für die Entwicklung innovativer digitaler Lösungen für eine patientenzentriete und personalisierte Versorgung und Forschung werden am meDIC bereits heute vielfältige Projekte in enger Kooperation mit den Forschern und Klinikern am Campus umgesetzt. Ein besonderer Fokus liegt hierbei auf der Entwicklung und Implementierung von KI basierten Systemen zur Optimierung der Patientenversorgung sowie der klinischen Prozesse. Im Rahmen des BHC-ETH Stipendienprogramms ist eine Fellowship-Position am meDIC zu besetzen.

Stellenbeschreibung

Ein langjähriges aktives Forschungsfeld des meDICs ist die automatisierte Erkennung und Vorhersage von Komplikationen, insbesondere auf der Intensivstation nach schweren chirurgischen Eingriffen. Hierbei ist das Ziel, die aus unterschiedlichen Quellen erzeugten Datenmengen so auszuwerten, dass die auf den relevanten Stationen tätigen Ärzt:innen und Pflegekräfte frühzeitig auf sich anbahnende schwerwiegende Komplikationen hingewiesen werden, um schnell und zielgerichtet einschreiten zu können. In enger Kooperation mit der Herzchirurgie und der Nephrologie wurden bereits sehr umfangreiche Vorarbeiten und vielversprechende Ergebnisse entwickelt und publiziert. Diese beinhalten auch innovative KI Modelle insbesondere für die Vorhersage von akutem Nierenversagen.

Im Rahmen des Stipendiums sollen diese Entwicklungen fortgeführt werden und für den Einsatz in der Regelversorgung weiterentwickelt werden. Ziel ist insbesondere:


Eine Verbesserung und Generalisierung bestehender KI Modelle unter Verwendung multimodaler Daten (Texte, Zeitreihen, …)
Die Einbindung und Zusammenführung weiterer klinischer Datenentitäten aus verschiedenen Quellsystemen
Die Planung und Durchführung einer praxisnahen Erprobung der entwickelten Funktionalitäten unter Begleitung des Fachbereichs
Die Entwicklung und Implementierung von Software Schnittstellen (bspw. REST-APIs) in einer hoch regulierten IT Infrastruktur
Die Umsetzung interner Softwarekomponenten zur Weiterentwicklung existierender Automatisierungsprozesse (ETL-Strecken)
Die Überführung des Projekts in eine nachhaltige Betriebsstruktur


Qualifikationen

Anforderungen

Wohnsitz: Nur für Bewerber aus Deutschland

Sprache: Deutsch - Muttersprachliches Niveau


Du hast ein abgeschlossenes Studium im Bereich Technische Kybernetik, Mechatronik, Maschinenbau oder eine vergleichbare Qualifikation und möchtest deine Kenntnisse in einem praxisnahen Umfeld einbringen? Dann bist du bei uns richtig.
Du bringst eine gesunde Neugier mit, gepaart mit dem Wunsch, experimentell zu arbeiten und die gewonnenen Daten systematisch auszuwerten. Dabei gehst du eigenverantwortlich und mit hoher Eigenmotivation an neue Herausforderungen heran – sei es beim Erlernen neuer Methoden oder beim Lösen technischer Fragestellungen.
Deine analytische Stärke ergänzt du durch Teamgeist und ausgeprägte Kommunikationsfähigkeiten, mit denen du dich aktiv in unser dynamisches Entwicklungsteam einbringst. Idealerweise hast du bereits Erfahrung in Versuchsplanung, Datenanalyse und Systemdynamik gesammelt. Kenntnisse in Matlab, Python oder GIT sind von Vorteil – aber kein Muss, wenn du bereit bist, dich schnell einzuarbeiten.


Tätigkeiten


In deiner Rolle entwickelst du Validierungsszenarien mit Fokus auf Druckqualität, Dynamik und Genauigkeit, um Weiterentwicklungen und neue Funktionalitäten an unserem 3D-Betondrucker systematisch zu evaluieren. Du führst präzise Messungen zur Druckgenauigkeit und zum dynamischen Verhalten des Drucksystems durch und leitest daraus konkrete Optimierungspotenziale ab.
Darüber hinaus definierst du eine skalierbare Dateninfrastruktur für die Analyse umfangreicher Zeitreihen – stets mit dem Ziel, deine Lösungen nahtlos in unsere durchgängige, interoperable Toollandschaft zu integrieren. Als zentrale Ansprechperson für die Datenauswertung übernimmst du Verantwortung für die Analyseprozesse und treibst datenbasierte Entscheidungsgrundlagen aktiv voran.
Du identifizierst Fehlerursachen, entwickelst fundierte Lösungsvorschläge und teilst deine Erkenntnisse mit Kolleg:innen aus Entwicklung und Baustellenteam. In enger Abstimmung mit internen wie externen Stakeholdern leistest du so einen maßgeblichen Beitrag zur kontinuierlichen Verbesserung unseres 3D-Druckprozesses.


Team

Bei INSTATIQ wirst du Teil eines hochmotivierten, interdisziplinären Teams, das mit Leidenschaft an der Digitalisierung und Automatisierung des Bauens arbeitet. Unsere Kultur ist geprägt von flachen Hierarchien, kurzen Entscheidungswegen und echtem Gestaltungswillen – jede Meinung zählt, jede Idee kann den Unterschied machen. In deiner Rolle arbeitest du direkt unter dem CTO und bist damit nah an der technischen Strategie des Unternehmens beteiligt. Du bringst dein Know-how unmittelbar in richtungsweisende Entscheidungen ein und gestaltest gemeinsam mit dem CTO und dem Team zukunftsfähige Softwarelösungen, die reale Probleme lösen und echte Wirkung entfalten. Bei uns findest du ein dynamisches Umfeld, in dem Innovation nicht nur gefordert, sondern aktiv gefördert wird – mit Raum für Eigenverantwortung, technologische Exzellenz und persönliches Wachstum.

Über das Unternehmen

Wir bei INSTATIQ revolutionieren die Baubranche mit unserer innovativen 3D-Betondruck-Technologie. Als Startup und Spinoff der Putzmeister Unternehmensgruppe verbinden wir technologische Exzellenz mit nachhaltigen Lösungen. Unser Ziel ist es, den Bauprozess effizienter, umweltfreundlicher und zukunftssicher zu machen.

Steuerbot ist ein Start-up aus Stuttgart (Fellbach). Unsere Mission ist es, allen Menschen eine Steuererklärung wie vom Steuerberater zu ermöglichen. Dazu führt Steuerbot den Nutzer im Chat mit persönlichen, leicht verständlichen und individuell angepassten Fragen auf dem optimalen Weg zu seiner Steuererklärung. Mit unserer Steuer-App kämpfen wir dafür, dass wirklich jeder seine Steuererklärung selbst machen kann und das Maximale für sich herausholt – unabhängig von Gehalt und Lebenssituation! 💪

Das sind wir 👫

Bei uns geht es darum, kreative Ideen umzusetzen und unsere Vision Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Wir verstecken uns nicht hinter ausgefallenen Berufsbezeichnungen oder bürokratischen Prozessen. Stattdessen behandeln wir alle im Team gleich, fair und geben jede Menge Freiheit, um gemeinsam etwas Großartiges zu (er-)schaffen.

Jeder macht Fehler, wir auch! Wir versuchen aber aus allen Fehlern zu lernen und treffen unsere Entscheidungen immer mit Daten, Logik 📈 und gesundem Menschenverstand 🧠

Seit 7 Jahren ist Steuerbot eine der bestbewerteten Steuer-Apps in Deutschland 🤩 Seit zwei Jahren bieten wir zusammen mit Taxfix ein breites Spektrum an Steuerlösungen an, die wir mit dir in die Hände von Millionen Steuerzahlern bringen möchten.

Deine Aufgaben 👩‍💻

Als Fullstack-Entwickler wirst du Teil eines geteilten Teams zwischen Steuerbot und Taxfix unter der direkten Führung der Steuerbot Gründer. Du hilfst uns, die einzigartige Technologie zu entwickeln, die das Wachstum von Steuerbot und Taxfix ermöglicht und weiter beschleunigt. Gleichzeitig hast du die Möglichkeit, bereits bestehende Ansätze in den Bereichen CI/CD und Testautomatisierung weiter auszubauen. Auch abseits der reinen Entwicklung hast du die Möglichkeit, dich mit spannenden Themen wie maschinelles Lernen, Datenbankoptimierung oder Data Engineering zu befassen. Gerne geben wir dir die Zeit, dich in neue Themengebiete einzuarbeiten und dich weiterzuentwickeln!

Dazu wirst du:


Die Weiterentwicklung und Pflege unserer internen Services und Tools übernehmen.
Den Aufbau einer skalierbaren, zukunftsorientierten Architektur und Infrastruktur wesentlich mitgestalten.
Eng mit unserem Produkt- und Frontend-Team zusammenarbeiten, um neue Funktionen zu entwerfen und umzusetzen.
Ganzheitlich denken, um unseren Kunden die bestmögliche Usability bieten zu können.
Die Möglichkeit haben, bei der Entwicklung ganz neuer Features oder Produkte von Anfang an involviert zu sein und einen großen Beitrag zu leisten.


Das beschreibt dich 🙋‍♂️


Du hast sehr gute Kenntnisse in mindestens einer objektorientierten oder funktionalen Programmiersprache (C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Javascript/Typescript, Scala, Python) – idealerweise Kenntnisse in Go.
Du hast Spaß am Schreiben von performantem und wartbarem Code.
Erfahrungen mit dem Entwurf und der Implementierung komplexer Systeme
Know-how in Containerorchestrierung mit Kubernetes, Docker-Swarm oder vergleichbaren Tools
Du hast großes Interesse, in ganz neue Themen einzusteigen.
Du hast Lust, ein wichtiges Teammitglied zu werden und hast Freude am Arbeiten in einem kleinen, sehr effizienten Team.


Das bieten wir dir 🎁


Löse mit uns ein Problem, das jeder in Deutschland kennt – auch deine Familie und Freunde!
Im coolsten Start-up der Stadt hast du einen großen und vor allem direkten Einfluss auf den Erfolg und die Zufriedenheit unserer Nutzer.
Top modernes Büro: Tischtennisplatte, ergonomische Stühle, beschreibbare Wände, …
Natürlich flexible Arbeitszeiten + Homeoffice
Top Ausstattung (Apple/Mac-Hardware) 💻
Kaffee- und Getränke-Flatrate für alle ☕️
Ein kleines, familiäres Team bei Steuerbot 👪
großes, tolles Team bei Taxfix in Berlin
Gemeinsame Aktivitäten im Team 🎳🏃🍻
Die passenden Steuerbot-Birkenstock-Büro-Hausschuhe 👡


Es ist immer eine aufregende Zeit bei Steuerbot – wir haben viele großartige Ideen für die Zukunft und einige spannende Herausforderungen, an denen wir gerne mit dir arbeiten möchten. Wir hoffen, dass du dir vorstellen kannst, ein Teil unseres Teams und unserer Geschichte zu werden! 🚀

Wir sind pragmatisch in dem, was wir tun. Deswegen ist es uns wichtig, dich nicht mit dem umständlichen Verfassen eines Anschreibens aufzuhalten. Wir freuen uns, wenn du zu deinem Lebenslauf kurz und formlos folgende zwei Fragen beantwortest:


Warum reizt dich gerade Steuerbot?
Was erwartest du von deiner Position bei Steuerbot?

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Out humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

You will be asked to demo your experience in the interview process
Proficiency in Swedish


What We Offer


Professional growth - to work with the most talented developers in the industry.
Modern technology - we invest in the latest technologies and tools, we sign agreements with the largest players, and we encourage our team members to share their ideas and take ownership of their work to form a collaborative environment where AI is used throughout the group.
Innovation - to work on exciting projects that push the boundaries of our industry and make a real impact.
Commitment to quality - a dynamic and forward-thinking company that values profitable and long-term product development.


Location

We find great value in being able to work closely with our Stockholm-based team in person. At the same time, we understand the need to focus deeply without interruptions. Therefore, the team works according to a hybrid setup with 3 days at the Stockholm office, and 2 days remotely from home, combining the best of both worlds.

Excited?

If you are excited about being part of a successful team, apply for this position!

Filed is building the first AI tax preparer trusted by America’s accounting firms. This industry might seem boring—but it’s a $70B backbone of the economy that’s breaking under a talent shortage no one has solved. We’re fixing it—fast.

In just 9 months, we’ve hit strong product-market fit, are generating fast-growing, sticky revenue, and are backed by top-tier investors. We’re not a tool—we’re the missing workforce firms have been sounding the alarm for. We’re building the future with expanding our already 30 person team, with those who want to say “I was there when it all started.”

⸻

Here’s Why This Is a Terrible Job

This is not a job for someone who likes to move slow.

We operate week to week with ruthless speed. Sometimes we’re going in the wrong direction, but more times than not we’re going in the right direction.

If you need a few extra days to perfect your model, chances are there’s already a handful of team members blocked behind you.

We use tools like Cursor, OpenAI, and Gemini to prototype fast, test in prod, and push to users in hours—not quarters.

You’ll be operating at the intersection of large language models, user behavior, regulatory compliance, and structured knowledge graphs.

There are no clean datasets. No definitive papers. Just judgment calls, ambiguity, and noise from every direction.

You’ll ask yourself, is this really the work?

It is. And it’s not for everyone.

⸻

Here's Why It's The Best Career Choice You'll Make

We’re hyperscaling. We’re very well-funded. Generating very fast revenue, and have reached a strong product market fit score all within 9 months.

We’re building what tax pros call impossible. A product that behaves like a teammate, not just another tool.

We run reviews every 4 months. We operate with total transparency around pay, performance, and progress.

You’ll be paid above market. You’ll earn equity that grows fast.

And you’ll have full autonomy to make high-impact decisions.

You’ll ship models because you believe in them, not because they passed a review board.

You’ll talk to users weekly. You’ll drive outcomes end to end.

We’ll tell you the goal. How you reach it—prompting, fine-tuning, embeddings, retrieval, structured data—is up to you.

We expect you to build a customer Oracle. An internal simulator so precise it can predict what a user will ask, before they even ask it.

That comes from immersion, curiosity, and care.

⸻

The Teammate We're Looking For


Thinks in probabilities, systems, and second-order consequences
Navigates ambiguity across LLMs, APIs, and semi-structured corpora
Gets excited by the edge cases most people run away from
No research-for-research’s-sake — we ship fast and learn even faster
Big bonus if you’ve shipped AI products into production, not just demos


⸻

What You’ll Be Responsible For


Designing and implementing LLM-powered workflows across tax, finance, and compliance
Building and scaling Graphiti-like knowledge systems for memory and retrieval
Owning prompt pipelines, vector stores, fine-tuned models, and evals
Becoming an Oracle with a model of the customer and the domain in your head


⸻

Your Hard Skillset


Deep understanding of how LLMs actually work under the hood—beyond the hype
Fluency with APIs like OpenAI, Gemini, Claude; experience with structured evals
Comfortable working across Python and cloud infra (GCP or Azure)
Strong grasp of embeddings, RAG, structured retrieval, and production-grade inference
Bonus if you’ve contributed to or built internal tooling for model debugging or evals


⸻

Your Soft Skillset


Ruthlessly pragmatic—knows when to ship and when to iterate
Empathetic with users and critical of vague assumptions
Deeply collaborative across product, engineering, and operations
Obsessively curious—you want to understand everything about the domain you’re automating
You own your outcomes—and love having your work in front of real users daily


⸻

Growth And Levels

We operate on six levels, from Level 1 to Level 6. Each reflects increasing ownership, impact, and scope with meaningful jumps in salary and equity.

We review levels every 4 months. Promotions are based on output and ownership, not tenure.

This isn’t a comfy AI role. It’s fast, focused, and brutally user-driven.

You will build fast. You will learn fast. You will own what you ship.

⸻

The process


Quick intro call
Code and system walkthrough + async technical task
Final round with our team
Optional 2 to 3 day paid trial
Then we decide together if this is the right fight


⸻

If you want to work with real users, real constraints, and build AI that goes far beyond chatbot demos—this is it.

Compensation Range: $71.5K - $104K

Brixo är ett snabbväxande fintechbolag som utmanar det traditionella banksystemet genom digitala kontokrediter, med innovativa lösningar som gör finansiering mer tillgänglig och bygger på ansvarsfull kreditprövning. Vi har tillstånd att bedriva konsumentkreditgivning och har nyligen ansökt om tillstånd att driva finansieringsrörelse, vilket ger en unik möjlighet att vara med från start och bygga upp en analysverksamhet anpassad till nya regulatoriska krav. Samtidigt genomgår marknaden för konsumentkrediter stora förändringar med nya lagförslag, vilket gör det till en spännande tid att bidra med analys och insikter som driver verksamheten framåt.




Om tjänsten

Som Data Scientist hos oss får du en central roll i att forma vår analysavdelning. Du kommer arbeta i ett mindre analysteam under uppbyggnad och stöttar andra avdelningar med analys, ad-hoc-initiativ, uppföljning, rapportering och utvecklingsprojekt. Du kommer också att delta i verksamhetsnära initiativ inom allt från kreditriskmodellering till finansiell rapportering, där din tekniska expertis och analytiska förmåga stärker bolagets kapacitet inom finans, risk och compliance.




Det här ser vi gärna hos dig:

2 - 5 års erfarenhet i rollen som Data Scientist eller motsvarande
Goda kunskaper i Python, SQL och datavisualiseringsverktyg
Erfarenhet av att arbeta i molnmiljöer, särskilt AWS 
Flytande i svenska och engelska

Har du dessutom erfarenhet av maskininlärning och/eller kreditriskmodeller inom finans är det ett plus i kanten.




Varför Brixo?

Vi erbjuder en inspirerande arbetsmiljö med cirka 25 stycken engagerade kollegor och stora möjligheter att påverka. Vår kultur präglas av öppenhet, innovation och teamwork.




Hos oss får du:

Möjlighet att påverka, både din roll och vår utveckling
Regelbundna afterworks, middagar och teamevents
Tjänstepension via Avanza och generöst friskvårdsbidrag
Centralt beläget kontor i Stockholm med flexibla arbetstider

Vi arbetar heltid på plats, dels av säkerhetsskäl, men också för att vi som litet team värdesätter den nära samarbetsmiljön, där spontana samtal och snabba avstämningar gör stor skillnad i vår vardag.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Ads Analytics At Wolt

As the name Ads Analytics implies, this team aims to provide reliable data insights that drive informed decision-making, empower Wolt's product organisation, and foster a data-driven culture through collaboration and education.

About The Ads Domain

The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer visibility and increased performance. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect Marketing or AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Stockholm and Tallinn, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
5+ years of experience in a Data Analyst or Data Scientist position.
Experience with the Ads domain - as a huge plus.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing (A/B testing), experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.


Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Are you a medical doctor with clinical experience or a PhD or postdoc interested in working with cutting-edge cell therapies and contributing to groundbreaking research – then take the opportunity to apply for the role as Clinical Research Scientist at Cellcolabs.

About Cellcolabs

Cellcolabs is an impact start-up specializing in the industrial GMP production of high-quality Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs). Our mission is to prevent and treat diseases by making high quality stem cells available and affordable. We do that by industrial scale production and collaborations. Based at Campus Solna, Cellcolabs builds on over 20 years of stem cell research and clinical expertise from Karolinska Institutet.

We are expanding through a series of clinical trials across different locations globally and need to expand our team with one more highly motivated and ambitious Clinical Research Scientist to interpret and communicate trial participants’ results and generate research findings on the ICH-GCP compliant clinical data in these trials.

The role

As a member of our Clinical Success team, you will be responsible for analysing how MSCs influence biomarkers related to inflammation, immune regulation, and cellular aging, as well as developing strategies to optimize our therapies in collaboration with the RnD team. If you are a medical doctor and/or a driven scientist with a passion for translational research, we want you on our team!

Key Responsibilities:


Interpret large datasets generated within our clinical trials from initiation to close-out, focusing on long-term follow-up data in line with study protocols and quality standards.
Generate research findings from exploratory laboratory test results on +60 biomarkers, study questionnaires and qualitative data from follow-up visits between participants and investigators.
Analyse and draw conclusions on individual laboratory results on biomarkers related to inflammation, immunoprofiling and age-related diseases to be communicated externally in meetings with patients within our patient-funded trials.
Compile and present research findings internally and externally (conferences, scientific publications, regulatory reports).
Review validation reports and select clinical and laboratory partners in line with necessary quality standards, as well as build and maintain effective relationships with external laboratory partners within the clinical trials.
Collaborate interdisciplinary internally with teams in preclinical research, clinical development, and business strategy to advance our MSC-based therapies and product development initiatives.
Build the foundation and structure for the clinical biomarker data analytics as the company grows (we are a startup where we build ground as we go).


Qualifications And Requirements

We want you to grow together with us and we will do our best for you to develop and enjoy work. For this role you will need the following:


Clinical experience as medical doctor and/or PhD or postdoc experience in cell biology, immunology, molecular biology, biomedicine, precision medicine or a related field in inflammation and/or biomarker research.
Experience of quantifying biomarkers such as inflammatory cytokines, lymphocytes, telomere length, DNA methylation, clinical chemistry markers and other MSC relevant parameters using advanced techniques (Luminex, qPCR, flow cytometry, NGS etc).
Strong communication skills and excellent skills in written and spoken Swedish and English – partly to be used in conversations with trials participants.
Basic knowledge of statistics and coding.
Bonus: Experience in bioinformatics and AI-driven analyses.
You are self-motivated, analytical, and innovative – you thrive in a fast-paced startup environment where you take ownership and make an impact without compromising on quality and scientific integrity.
You have a flexible mindset and capability to operate in a company where multiple logics meet - ranging from GMP production of MSCs, B2B sales to clinical partners, development and operations within clinical trials and B2C marketing and diagnostics streams in our trials.


What We Offer

The role will involve collaboration and teamwork as well as independent work. The role may involve international travel, with our offices in Solna, Sweden as the base.

What is it like to work at Cellcolabs?

At Cellcolabs, we are committed to your growth and professional development. We offer a supportive and dynamic work environment, good employment conditions, and the opportunity to be part of a team that is making a real difference in the field of stem cell medicine.

We are committed to the growth of our cells, our company and ourselves, and are passionate about making a real difference in people´s lives and to promote a better health globally. We win as one, embracing collaboration as an integral part of our culture. We believe that nothing is impossible, finding new and creative solutions. We celebrate victories and create a workplace where everyone feels valued and motivated. Our decisions are guided by scientific integrity, transparency, and high ethical standards.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Vi är ett innovativt och samarbetsorienterat team som fokuserar på att skapa lösningar som gör skillnad, både för våra kunder och våra medarbetare. Hos oss får du möjlighet att bidra till att bygga skalbara, robusta och användarvänliga AI-lösningar som spelar en central roll för vår verksamhet.

Om jobbet

Som AI-Engineer med fokus på generativ AI på Länsförsäkringar AB blir du en nyckelperson i vårt tvärfunktionella spjutspetsteam med fullstack-kompetens. Vi bygger lösningar från ax till limpa och arbetar med hela livscykeln för våra applikationer. Hos oss får du möjlighet att arbeta brett över alla lager i applikationen och utveckla din förståelse för hur moderna AI-system fungerar i praktiken.

Vi arbetar med flera plattformar, dels exponerade mot slutkund, och dels interna system som används av våra medarbetare. En av våra mest centrala plattformar är vår interna GPT-lösning, som används av över 6000 medarbetare för att effektivisera arbetsflöden och beslutsfattande.

Rollen är fokuserad kring tre huvudsakliga områden:


Språkmodeller Utveckla lösningar som använder språkmodeller och agentteknik för att förstå användarens behov, identifiera relevant information och fatta beslut kring hur denna information ska användas. Du arbetar med tekniker som retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), prompt engineering och agentramverk för att skapa kraftfulla och användarvänliga AI-drivna upplevelser.
Databearbetning Bygg skalbara och robusta datapipelines som gör det möjligt för användare att ladda upp filer och extrahera relevant information. Du ansvarar för att konvertera, strukturera och lagra data i olika former, som exempelvis objektlagring, vektor- eller grafdatabaser, och bygger integrationer mot andra system för att tillgängliggöra information.
Operationalisering Arbeta med att säkerställa att våra generativa AI-lösningar är robusta, säkra och skalbara i praktiken. Det innebär att hantera hela driftsättningen och livscykelhanteringen av plattformarna – från övervakning och felsökning till prestandaoptimering och rättighetshantering. Du ser till att lösningarna uppfyller de höga krav på säkerhet och dataskydd som gäller inom finansiell verksamhet och skapar förutsättningar för god observerbarhet.


Vår teknikstack

Vi använder en flexibel teknikstack för att bygga och skala våra lösningar:


Språk: Python, Javascript, Typescript
Databaser: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind, DaisyUI
API Gateway: Nginx
Plattform: Azure Container Apps – Planeras för Kubernetes
Backend: FastAPI, Celery
Lokal utvecklingsmiljö: Docker Compose, WSL, VS Code med GitHub Copilot
CI/CD: Azure Devops
IaC: Bicep


Vem är du?

För att trivas och lyckas i denna roll ser vi att du har kunskap inom några av följande områden:


Backendutveckling: Erfarenhet av Python och gärna FastAPI för att bygga API:er. Kunskap inom Celery och asynkron programmering är meriterande.
Databaser: Erfarenhet av att arbeta med MongoDB och PostgreSQL som applikationsdatabaser. Kunskap om vektor- och grafbaserad datahantering är ett plus.
Frontendutveckling: Grundläggande kunskaper i React.js och Tailwind CSS är meriterande, men inte ett krav.
Molnplattformar: Erfarenhet av att arbeta med Azure och containerlösningar som Kubernetes är fördelaktigt.
CI/CD och DevOps: Erfarenhet av att arbeta med Azure DevOps eller liknande SCM-plattformar samt förståelse för och hantering av CI/CD-pipelines.
Infrastruktur som kod (IaC): Erfarenhet av att använda Bicep eller andra IaC-verktyg är meriterande.
Praktisk erfarenhet av att integrera LLMs i olika lösningar är meriterande.
Samverkande och kommunikativ: Du trivs i tvärfunktionella team och kan kommunicera lösningar till både tekniska och icke-tekniska intressenter.


Vi söker någon som:


Har ett intresse av att skapa en helhetsbild och utveckla ett systemtänk, även om du inte har expertkunskap inom alla områden.
Är nyfiken och villig att lära dig och växa inom olika delar av stacken.
Är självgående men också samarbetsvillig och löser problem effektivt tillsammans med andra.
Trivs i en dynamisk och innovativ arbetsmiljö där du får bidra till att bygga framtidens lösningar.

Vill du ha en roll där du kan använda din analytiska kompetens för att göra verklig skillnad? Vi söker en erfaren Lead Data Scientist som vill leda utvecklingen inom AI och ML – hos några av Sveriges mest spännande bolag.




Hos oss får du inte bara bygga modeller – du blir en nyckelspelare i att forma våra kunders beslut genom datadrivna insikter.




Du kliver in i ett ambitiöst team av data scientists och analytiker där samarbete, nytänkande och affärsförståelse är centrala värden. Vi söker dig som både har djup teknisk kompetens och förmågan att se det större perspektivet – att koppla analys till faktiska affärsresultat.







Vad Du Får Hos Oss

Påverkan på riktigt – var med och forma strategi, processer och beslut hos Sveriges mest intressanta företag.
Ett skarpt team – jobba med drivna och kunniga kollegor som brinner för AI/ML och avancerad analys.
Ständig utveckling – ta ledningen i den tekniska utvecklingen inom AI, maskininlärning och analyslösningar.
Riktiga case – arbeta med allt från datatransformation och produktinnovation till affärsoptimering.
En öppen kultur – hos oss är det korta beslutsvägar, högt i tak och fokus på samarbete snarare än prestige.







Vi Tror Att Du Har

En akademisk bakgrund inom datavetenskap, statistik, matematik eller liknande.
Minst 8 års erfarenhet som Data Scientist, gärna i roller med både strategiskt ansvar och kundkontakt.
Förmåga att driva komplexa affärsproblem från behov till lösning – med hjälp av dataanalys och modellering.
Talang för att göra det komplexa begripligt och presentera insikter på ett affärsmässigt sätt.







Teknisk Skicklighet Som Vi Gillar

Programmering: Python (t.ex. Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), gärna även SQL, SAS eller R.
ML / AI: Gedigen erfarenhet av att bygga, träna och implementera prediktiva modeller och optimeringslösningar.
Datahantering: Vana vid att strukturera och bearbeta data för analys samt att produktionssätta modeller – gärna i cloudmiljö.
Visualisering: Förmåga att skapa insiktsfulla visualiseringar med verktyg som Power BI eller Python-bibliotek som Seaborn eller Plotly.




Du talar och skriver flytande svenska – och har gärna ett starkt kontaktnät i Stockholm eller Sverige.




Vill du vara med och skapa affärsvärde på riktigt – i ett nyfiket, internationellt team där du får både ansvar och frihet? Då vill vi höra från dig.

Om oss

Vi på Softronic jobbar ständigt med att förﬂytta våra kunder mot morgondagens teknik. Vare sig det handlar om att utveckla AI, automatisera processer eller modernisera en äldre lösning med bibehållen tillgänglighet. En annan sida av det vi gör är att vi hjälper våra kunder att utveckla innovativa och driftsäkra tjänster som skapar samhällsnytta genom att förenkla människors liv och jobb. På så sätt blir vi och vår teknik en positiv kraft i samhället och en del i att göra världen lite mer hållbar. Det är det vi kallar GoodTech.

Vi ser arbetet och arbetsplatsen som en av flera energigivande delar i människans liv. Därför odlar vi aktivt en kultur av gemenskap och lust, där brädspelskvällar, löprundor med kollegorna längs vattnet eller en ﬁka på terrassen är viktigt och ska få lov att ta plats. Genom gemenskap och samhörighet blir det också enklare att tillsammans vidareutveckla våra förmågor, för att i förlängningen kunna vässa vårt erbjudande mot våra kunder.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Out humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Filed is building the first AI tax preparer trusted by America’s accounting firms. This industry might seem boring—but it’s a $70B backbone of the economy that’s breaking under a talent shortage no one has solved. We’re fixing it—fast.

In just 9 months, we’ve hit strong product-market fit, are generating fast-growing, sticky revenue, and are backed by top-tier investors. We’re not a tool—we’re the missing workforce firms have been sounding the alarm for. We’re building the future with expanding our already 30 person team, with those who want to say “I was there when it all started.”

⸻

Here’s Why This Is a Terrible Job

This is not a job for someone who likes to move slow.

We operate week to week with ruthless speed. Sometimes we’re going in the wrong direction, but more times than not we’re going in the right direction.

If you need a few extra days to perfect your model, chances are there’s already a handful of team members blocked behind you.

We use tools like Cursor, OpenAI, and Gemini to prototype fast, test in prod, and push to users in hours—not quarters.

You’ll be operating at the intersection of large language models, user behavior, regulatory compliance, and structured knowledge graphs.

There are no clean datasets. No definitive papers. Just judgment calls, ambiguity, and noise from every direction.

You’ll ask yourself, is this really the work?

It is. And it’s not for everyone.

⸻

Here's Why It's The Best Career Choice You'll Make

We’re hyperscaling. We’re very well-funded. Generating very fast revenue, and have reached a strong product market fit score all within 9 months.

We’re building what tax pros call impossible. A product that behaves like a teammate, not just another tool.

We run reviews every 4 months. We operate with total transparency around pay, performance, and progress.

You’ll be paid above market. You’ll earn equity that grows fast.

And you’ll have full autonomy to make high-impact decisions.

You’ll ship models because you believe in them, not because they passed a review board.

You’ll talk to users weekly. You’ll drive outcomes end to end.

We’ll tell you the goal. How you reach it—prompting, fine-tuning, embeddings, retrieval, structured data—is up to you.

We expect you to build a customer Oracle. An internal simulator so precise it can predict what a user will ask, before they even ask it.

That comes from immersion, curiosity, and care.

⸻

The Teammate We're Looking For


Thinks in probabilities, systems, and second-order consequences
Navigates ambiguity across LLMs, APIs, and semi-structured corpora
Gets excited by the edge cases most people run away from
No research-for-research’s-sake — we ship fast and learn even faster
Big bonus if you’ve shipped AI products into production, not just demos


⸻

What You’ll Be Responsible For


Designing and implementing LLM-powered workflows across tax, finance, and compliance
Building and scaling Graphiti-like knowledge systems for memory and retrieval
Owning prompt pipelines, vector stores, fine-tuned models, and evals
Becoming an Oracle with a model of the customer and the domain in your head


⸻

Your Hard Skillset


Deep understanding of how LLMs actually work under the hood—beyond the hype
Fluency with APIs like OpenAI, Gemini, Claude; experience with structured evals
Comfortable working across Python and cloud infra (GCP or Azure)
Strong grasp of embeddings, RAG, structured retrieval, and production-grade inference
Bonus if you’ve contributed to or built internal tooling for model debugging or evals


⸻

Your Soft Skillset


Ruthlessly pragmatic—knows when to ship and when to iterate
Empathetic with users and critical of vague assumptions
Deeply collaborative across product, engineering, and operations
Obsessively curious—you want to understand everything about the domain you’re automating
You own your outcomes—and love having your work in front of real users daily


⸻

Growth And Levels

We operate on six levels, from Level 1 to Level 6. Each reflects increasing ownership, impact, and scope with meaningful jumps in salary and equity.

We review levels every 4 months. Promotions are based on output and ownership, not tenure.

This isn’t a comfy AI role. It’s fast, focused, and brutally user-driven.

You will build fast. You will learn fast. You will own what you ship.

⸻

The process


Quick intro call
Code and system walkthrough + async technical task
Final round with our team
Optional 2 to 3 day paid trial
Then we decide together if this is the right fight


⸻

If you want to work with real users, real constraints, and build AI that goes far beyond chatbot demos—this is it.

Compensation Range: $71.5K - $104K

          <strong>About Filed<br><br></strong>Filed is building the <strong>first AI tax preparer</strong> trusted by America’s accounting firms. This industry might seem boring—but it’s a $70B backbone of the economy that’s breaking under a talent shortage no one has solved. We’re fixing it—fast.<br><br>In just 9 months, we’ve hit <strong>strong product-market fit</strong>, are generating <strong>fast-growing, sticky revenue</strong>, and are <strong>backed by top-tier investors</strong>. We’re not a tool—we’re the missing workforce firms have been sounding the alarm for. We’re building the future with expanding our already 30 person team, with those who want to say <strong>“I was there when it all started.”<br><br></strong>⸻<br><br><strong>Here’s Why This Is a Terrible Job<br><br></strong>This is not a job for someone who likes to move slow.<br><br>We operate week to week with ruthless speed. Sometimes we’re going in the wrong direction, but more times than not we’re going in the right direction.<br><br>If you need a few extra days to perfect your model, chances are there’s already a handful of team members blocked behind you.<br><br>We use tools like Cursor, OpenAI, and Gemini to prototype fast, test in prod, and push to users in hours—not quarters.<br><br>You’ll be operating at the intersection of large language models, user behavior, regulatory compliance, and structured knowledge graphs.<br><br>There are no clean datasets. No definitive papers. Just judgment calls, ambiguity, and noise from every direction.<br><br>You’ll ask yourself, is this really the work?<br><br>It is. And it’s not for everyone.<br><br>⸻<br><br><strong>Here's Why It's The Best Career Choice You'll Make<br><br></strong>We’re hyperscaling. We’re very well-funded. Generating very fast revenue, and have reached a strong product market fit score all within 9 months.<br><br>We’re building what tax pros call impossible. A product that behaves like a teammate, not just another tool.<br><br>We run reviews every 4 months. We operate with total transparency around pay, performance, and progress.<br><br>You’ll be paid above market. You’ll earn equity that grows fast.<br><br>And you’ll have full autonomy to make high-impact decisions.<br><br>You’ll ship models because you believe in them, not because they passed a review board.<br><br>You’ll talk to users weekly. You’ll drive outcomes end to end.<br><br>We’ll tell you the goal. How you reach it—prompting, fine-tuning, embeddings, retrieval, structured data—is up to you.<br><br>We expect you to build a customer Oracle. An internal simulator so precise it can predict what a user will ask, before they even ask it.<br><br>That comes from immersion, curiosity, and care.<br><br>⸻<br><br><strong>The Teammate We're Looking For<br><br></strong><ul><li> Thinks in probabilities, systems, and second-order consequences</li><li> Navigates ambiguity across LLMs, APIs, and semi-structured corpora</li><li> Gets excited by the edge cases most people run away from</li><li> No research-for-research’s-sake — we ship fast and learn even faster</li><li> Big bonus if you’ve shipped AI products into production, not just demos<br><br></li></ul>⸻<br><br><strong>What You’ll Be Responsible For<br><br></strong><ul><li> Designing and implementing LLM-powered workflows across tax, finance, and compliance</li><li> Building and scaling Graphiti-like knowledge systems for memory and retrieval</li><li> Owning prompt pipelines, vector stores, fine-tuned models, and evals</li><li> Becoming an Oracle with a model of the customer and the domain in your head<br><br></li></ul>⸻<br><br><strong>Your Hard Skillset<br><br></strong><ul><li> Deep understanding of how LLMs actually work under the hood—beyond the hype</li><li> Fluency with APIs like OpenAI, Gemini, Claude; experience with structured evals</li><li> Comfortable working across Python and cloud infra (GCP or Azure)</li><li> Strong grasp of embeddings, RAG, structured retrieval, and production-grade inference</li><li> Bonus if you’ve contributed to or built internal tooling for model debugging or evals<br><br></li></ul>⸻<br><br><strong>Your Soft Skillset<br><br></strong><ul><li> Ruthlessly pragmatic—knows when to ship and when to iterate</li><li> Empathetic with users and critical of vague assumptions</li><li> Deeply collaborative across product, engineering, and operations</li><li> Obsessively curious—you want to understand everything about the domain you’re automating</li><li> You own your outcomes—and love having your work in front of real users daily<br><br></li></ul>⸻<br><br><strong>Growth And Levels<br><br></strong>We operate on six levels, from Level 1 to Level 6.

Are you a medical doctor with clinical experience or a PhD or postdoc interested in working with cutting-edge cell therapies and contributing to groundbreaking research – then take the opportunity to apply for the role as Clinical Research Scientist at Cellcolabs.

About Cellcolabs

Cellcolabs is an impact start-up specializing in the industrial GMP production of high-quality Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs). Our mission is to prevent and treat diseases by making high quality stem cells available and affordable. We do that by industrial scale production and collaborations. Based at Campus Solna, Cellcolabs builds on over 20 years of stem cell research and clinical expertise from Karolinska Institutet.

We are expanding through a series of clinical trials across different locations globally and need to expand our team with one more highly motivated and ambitious Clinical Research Scientist to interpret and communicate trial participants’ results and generate research findings on the ICH-GCP compliant clinical data in these trials.

The role

As a member of our Clinical Success team, you will be responsible for analysing how MSCs influence biomarkers related to inflammation, immune regulation, and cellular aging, as well as developing strategies to optimize our therapies in collaboration with the RnD team. If you are a medical doctor and/or a driven scientist with a passion for translational research, we want you on our team!

Key Responsibilities:


Interpret large datasets generated within our clinical trials from initiation to close-out, focusing on long-term follow-up data in line with study protocols and quality standards.
Generate research findings from exploratory laboratory test results on +60 biomarkers, study questionnaires and qualitative data from follow-up visits between participants and investigators.
Analyse and draw conclusions on individual laboratory results on biomarkers related to inflammation, immunoprofiling and age-related diseases to be communicated externally in meetings with patients within our patient-funded trials.
Compile and present research findings internally and externally (conferences, scientific publications, regulatory reports).
Review validation reports and select clinical and laboratory partners in line with necessary quality standards, as well as build and maintain effective relationships with external laboratory partners within the clinical trials.
Collaborate interdisciplinary internally with teams in preclinical research, clinical development, and business strategy to advance our MSC-based therapies and product development initiatives.
Build the foundation and structure for the clinical biomarker data analytics as the company grows (we are a startup where we build ground as we go).


Qualifications And Requirements

We want you to grow together with us and we will do our best for you to develop and enjoy work. For this role you will need the following:


Clinical experience as medical doctor and/or PhD or postdoc experience in cell biology, immunology, molecular biology, biomedicine, precision medicine or a related field in inflammation and/or biomarker research.
Experience of quantifying biomarkers such as inflammatory cytokines, lymphocytes, telomere length, DNA methylation, clinical chemistry markers and other MSC relevant parameters using advanced techniques (Luminex, qPCR, flow cytometry, NGS etc).
Strong communication skills and excellent skills in written and spoken Swedish and English – partly to be used in conversations with trials participants.
Basic knowledge of statistics and coding.
Bonus: Experience in bioinformatics and AI-driven analyses.
You are self-motivated, analytical, and innovative – you thrive in a fast-paced startup environment where you take ownership and make an impact without compromising on quality and scientific integrity.
You have a flexible mindset and capability to operate in a company where multiple logics meet - ranging from GMP production of MSCs, B2B sales to clinical partners, development and operations within clinical trials and B2C marketing and diagnostics streams in our trials.


What We Offer

The role will involve collaboration and teamwork as well as independent work. The role may involve international travel, with our offices in Solna, Sweden as the base.

What is it like to work at Cellcolabs?

At Cellcolabs, we are committed to your growth and professional development. We offer a supportive and dynamic work environment, good employment conditions, and the opportunity to be part of a team that is making a real difference in the field of stem cell medicine.

We are committed to the growth of our cells, our company and ourselves, and are passionate about making a real difference in people´s lives and to promote a better health globally. We win as one, embracing collaboration as an integral part of our culture. We believe that nothing is impossible, finding new and creative solutions.

Portchain was founded to make maritime shipping more predictable, efficient, and green, which currently transports 90% of global traded goods. By enabling more efficient operations and streamlining communication between terminals and shipping lines, Portchain is helping to optimise vessel speed, reduce idle time and ultimately lower fuel consumption. Today Portchain coordinates 5% of global shipping traffic, with projections to reach 10% by year-end and an ambitious 25% the following year. The environmental impact is significant, with fuel savings achieved through Portchain's platform equating to removing 100,000 cars from the roads from just the last 12 months.




The role

We are currently using Node.js (TypeScript) and PostgreSQL running on Google Cloud and using Github and Terraform for CI/CD.




We believe in release early, release often, which is why we run several daily releases using our continuous integration and deployment setup.




Developers work on projects in small teams of 2-3 people each. We focus on minimal overhead and bureaucracy as we want to ensure independence and that decision power stays within the teams. This means that teams have a lot of influence on how they work, what they focus on, and how they deliver new features and functionality.




A typical day as a Portchain software engineer will start with a team check-in to ensure nobody is blocked or needs help. Then maybe catch up with the PM about any questions before determining how to solve this. Maybe a quick chat with the Designer to see if your solution will match the need or if it is a data task, then catching-up with one of the analytics people to double check the data flow makes sense.




You’ll be responsible for moving your own code into production and monitoring it afterwards with our metrics and logging setup (built around Datadog).

You will work in our Copenhagen office with the option of working remotely 1-2 days a week.




What we're looking for

We don’t expect you to tick every box in our current tech stack. What matters is that you have experience as a developer, you like to learn, and know how to leverage your experience across technology stacks and languages.




But here's what would be a good fit:

Experience in more than one technology stack
RESTful/GraphQL APIs in Node.js, Go or similar
PostgreSQL, MySQL or similar
JavaScript, TypeScript or similar
Dependency management tools like Yarn or npm
Continuous integration, TDD or similar
Google Cloud, AWS, Azure or similar
Focus on quality and doing things right

You get extra points, if you:

Code in your spare time
Have GitHub or a similar account with sample code
Have Open Source development experience




What's in it for you?

Competitive salary and pension scheme
Flexible working hours
Awesome lunch from Meyers
Snacks and drinks
Amazing Colleagues: Collaborate with a team of passionate and talented individuals.
Development Budget: We support your career and skill development with a dedicated budget and time for learning and improvement.

Copli is a fast-growing GenAI software company transforming content creation workflows for the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. Over the past 12 months, we’ve established ourselves as a trusted partner, collaborating with many of the top pharma companies globally and are experiencing strong demand for our solution.




We’re building an innovative, agentic system that pushes the boundaries of what GenAI can do - redefining the “Medical, Legal, and Regulatory” (MLR) review process for promotional materials. This process is currently conducted 100% manually and requires specialized medical, legal, and regulatory expertise. At Copli, we’re automating it, saving days of manual work for our users.




We are principled, focused entirely on building useful, practical products our customers genuinely value. We leverage AI extensively but know great ideas require real human insight - yours.




About the role

We’re seeking a full-stack software engineer to help us reshape how marketing content is produced within one of the most regulated industries in the world. You'll work closely with our team on defining and building core product features. This could involve everything from developing AI agents that understand research papers, building evaluation pipelines to ensure their performance, and help shape how their output should be delivered to the end user.




You’re adaptable, proactive, and enjoy deeply understanding complex domains in order to automate them with software. Our team is lean and fast-moving, so you should thrive in a low-structure environment and be comfortable communicating clearly and effectively.




A few things to think about as you're reaching out to us:

What core principles guide your work? Which of these have remained stable for you across the pre- and post-GenAI landscape?
In the context of GenAI, how do you ensure you're solving genuine customer problems and adding tangible value - not just chasing hype?
How do you balance leveraging AI capabilities with essential human judgment or 'organic intelligence'? Where is human oversight most critical?
What's your approach to addressing inherent limitations, potential biases, or inaccuracies associated with GenAI tools?




What you will work on

Product development: Design and implement end-to-end AI solutions that automate complex MLR workflows
Innovation and prototyping: Explore new ideas and push the boundaries of what's possible with GenAI in regulated industries
System performance and evaluation: Optimize and benchmark our AI systems to ensure they meet the high standards required in pharmaceutical regulatory processes
Knowledge integration: Ensure our models have access to perfect sources including regulatory rules, medical information, and other domain-specific content to make accurate decisions
Internal tools: Build and maintain tools that improve our team's productivity and capabilities - we are a team of builders where everyone contributes where needed




You are a great fit if you:

Have strong experience with Python, and ideally React
Have worked in a startup or similarly fast-paced environment and thrive with autonomy and ambiguity
Have experience or strong interest in GenAI and building agentic/autonomous systems
Are comfortable working across the stack and rapidly prototyping and shipping solutions
Possess natural curiosity and a desire to learn and understand complex domains
Are relentlessly resourceful - able to deliver solutions and figure things out even when the path isn't clear




What we offer:

A highly collaborative and innovative team culture with a strong focus on learning and growth
The opportunity to shape cutting-edge AI technology in a fast-growing startup
Significant ownership and impact from day one
Excellent breakfast, chef-prepared lunch, and great coffee




Tech stack

Back-end: Python following Domain-Driven Design principles, cloud-native with Azure as our provider, LLMs from different providers
Front-end: React




How to Apply

Email Jacob (CEO, co-founder) at hello@copli.io with your CV/resume and a short note about your motivation.




We look forward to hearing from you!

The roughly 1 million new ML practitioners will face the same challenges that current ML practitioners do: to schedule ML jobs, you must not only be a strong ML engineer or data scientist but also be proficient in infrastructure setup, code packaging, virtual environments, and data engineering—all at once.




The stats speak for themselves:




58% of ML practitioners spend up to 20 hours per month on environment setup alone
93% report that AI team productivity would increase if real-time compute resources could be self-served easily
74% see clear value in having compute and scheduling functionality as part of a single, unified AI/ML platform




Mimiry is changing how ML is accessed today. Our platform makes it easier than ever to launch ML jobs. Utilizing a mix of cloud technologies and distributed ML, users can start training with the click of a button and access advanced machine learning capabilities - without needing substantial in-house mastery or infrastructure.




We take you from code to compute in minutes.




You are




A solid back-end developer with experience in several of the following areas: Cloud/SaaS development/architecture, Cloud infrastructure/DevOps, and machine learning
You hold a degree in Software Engineering, Computer Science, or another relevant major
You like to work in a dynamic environment where the focus is on the product (what we make) and where team performance is what counts
You have an opinion, you are open-minded, and you like to cooperate on collectively finding the best-suited solutions
You have a burning passion for being part of a deep-tech start-up on the forefront of technological innovation. That means being comfortable starting in a small team with the potential for rapid growth




Technical Requirements




You have experience with most of the following

Golang (Phyton, Javascript/Typescript is a big plus)
Implementing APIs (RESTful and/or GraphQL)
Event Driven Development/Design/Architecture
Cloud Security
Kubernetes
Microservices/(event-)functions
Docker/Contained




It is much appreciated if you have experience with




KEDA
Dapr
Redis
MongoDB
Kafka
OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo
Schema standards, like OpenAPI or Avro
Open Source (using and/or contributing)
Front-end frameworks like Angular, React, Next, Vue, or Svelte…




We offer




The opportunity to work on innovative solutions with both a domain and the tech being most relevant for the future developer role
One of the best office spaces in Copenhagen, at Bloxhub, next to the canals
Fully flexible work options with remote, hybrid, and in-office solutions
An ambitious team that truly wants to make an impact
Industry-standard salary and the possibility of stock option intensives

Are you currently pursuing a master’s degree in computer science, mathematics, economics, or something similar – and passionate about data, automation, and hands-on analysis? Then we have an exciting student position waiting for you in our Data Services & Automation team and we’d love to hear from you.




Why Aleta?

Aleta is a fast-moving fintech company that empowers family offices, wealth managers, and advisors with a holistic wealth overview and unparalleled insights in a next-generation wealth platform.




By bringing all investment data into one place and offering advanced AI-powered analytics tools, our platform enables users to seize control and turbocharge their productivity.




We’re a tight-knit team of specialists in finance and software development, working in a dynamic and collaborative environment. We love taking initiative, hosting social events, and fostering a team culture where ideas thrive and innovation is encouraged.




What you’ll be doing ⭐

Our team works with complex data structures, automation of manual processes, and supports onboarding of new clients to our platform – often in close collaboration with both developers and business stakeholders.




As our new Student Data Scientist, you’ll become an integral part of the team and work with tasks like:

Analyzing transaction data and validating data quality.
Developing smaller automation tools and data models.
Developing and implementing scripts for onboarding flows and client reporting.
Supporting operations and troubleshooting data flows.
Contributing to documentation and systematization of solutions.
Assisting with development of ML-based tools or data mapping.

You’ll work on real tasks that create real value for both clients and internal operations – and you’ll get professional sparring from experienced colleagues with both technical and financial backgrounds.




What we’re looking for 🎯

You’re probably a great match if you:

Are currently studying a relevant master’s program (e.g., computer science, data science, math-econ, etc.).
Have solid skills in SQL and Python — and ideally some experience with Power BI or similar.
Are analytical, detail-oriented, and care about data quality.
Have an interest in finance and investment (no need to be an expert – curiosity goes a long way).
Are proactive, self-driven, and enjoy working in a team that values collaboration and high standards.




What we offer 🎁

A study-relevant part-time job (approx. 15-20 hours/week) with flexibility around exam periods.
The chance to gain practical experience with data work on a scalable fintech platform.
A key role in a high-impact, cross-functional team.
A steep learning curve and plenty of room to grow your skills in a real-world setting.
The opportunity to grow in the role – potentially joining development or operations projects over time.




Sounds like you? 🚀

If you’re excited about joining a bunch of passionate nerds who are building the future of wealth management software, we’d love to hear from you!




We’ll be conducting interviews on a rolling basis.

Som softwareudvikler i Native Tech-teamet kommer du helt tæt på udviklingen af Bankdatas mobil- og netbank – med ansvar for centrale komponenter som login og signering. Her arbejder du med en kompleks hybrid-løsning, hvor kvalitet, samarbejde og de nyeste teknologier går hånd i hånd.

Din mission: Byg sikker og moderne mobilbank

Bankdatas mobil- og netbank er blandt de mest brugte finansielle apps i Danmark – og det stiller høje krav til både sikkerhed, stabilitet og brugervenlighed. I rollen som softwareudvikler bliver du medansvarlig for at videreudvikle de komponenter, der binder hele løsningen sammen: login, signering og andre kritiske sikkerhedsfunktioner.

Du kommer til at arbejde i grænselandet mellem native mobiludvikling og web, hvor du bygger videre på vores hybride platform. Her har du mulighed for både at dykke teknisk dybt og tænke på tværs – så vi sikrer, at mobilbanken ikke bare fungerer, men opleves gnidningsfri, moderne og tryg at bruge for slutbrugeren.

Teamet består af 5 udvikler og én PO. Vi er et tæt og erfarent team med højt til loftet, masser af sparring og frihed til at eksperimentere med ny teknologi – for vi har ambitioner om at sætte standarden for digital bankoplevelse.

Din rolle: Udvikl kernefunktioner i en af Danmarks mest brugte apps

Som softwareudvikler i Native Tech kommer du til at:


Udvikle og vedligeholde centrale komponenter i mobil- og netbanken – fx login og signering
Arbejde i krydsfeltet mellem native og web – med Angular, Capacitor, Android og iOS
Bidrage aktivt til teamets DevOps-setup og vores teknologiske retning
Tage ansvar for løsninger med høj kvalitet og sikkerhed
Være med til at sætte retning og udvikle teamets arbejdsformer



Din profil – Faglighed, nysgerrighed og lyst til at lære

Vi forestiller os, at du har en baggrund som datalog eller ingeniør – og vigtigst: at du er nysgerrig, lærevillig og teamorienteret.

Du har:


Erfaring med Android og/eller iOS udvikling – eller lyst til at dykke ned i det
Erfaring med Angular eller andet SPA-framework
Interesse for DevOps og at arbejde med drift og udvikling i samme team
Et øje for kvalitet og evnen til at tænke i helheder
Lyst til at tage ansvar og bidrage aktivt til teamet



Hvad tilbyder vi?


Opgaver med direkte indflydelse på brugeroplevelsen i mobil- og netbank
Et erfarent og fagligt stærkt team med høj trivsel og samarbejde
Udviklingsmuligheder gennem kurser, guilds og løbende sparring



Er du klar til at tage udfordringen op?

Send os dit CV allerede i dag via nedenstående link. Tiltrædelse er snarest muligt – vi indkalder løbende til samtaler. Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte Nikolas Bram, leder for Team Native Tech, på nbm@bankdata.dk eller +45 24770158.

The roughly 1 million new ML practitioners will face the same challenges that current ML practitioners do: to schedule ML jobs, you must not only be a strong ML engineer or data scientist but also be proficient in infrastructure setup, code packaging, virtual environments, and data engineering—all at once.




The stats speak for themselves:




58% of ML practitioners spend up to 20 hours per month on environment setup alone
93% report that AI team productivity would increase if real-time compute resources could be self-served easily
74% see clear value in having compute and scheduling functionality as part of a single, unified AI/ML platform




Mimiry is changing how ML is accessed today. Our platform makes it easier than ever to launch ML jobs. Utilizing a mix of cloud technologies and distributed ML, users can start training with the click of a button and access advanced machine learning capabilities - without needing substantial in-house mastery or infrastructure.




We take you from code to compute in minutes.




You are




A solid back-end developer with experience in several of the following areas: Cloud/SaaS development/architecture, Cloud infrastructure/DevOps, and machine learning
You hold a degree in Software Engineering, Computer Science, or another relevant major
You like to work in a dynamic environment where the focus is on the product (what we make) and where team performance is what counts
You have an opinion, you are open-minded, and you like to cooperate on collectively finding the best-suited solutions
You have a burning passion for being part of a deep-tech start-up on the forefront of technological innovation. That means being comfortable starting in a small team with the potential for rapid growth




Technical Requirements




You have experience with most of the following

Golang (Phyton, Javascript/Typescript is a big plus)
Implementing APIs (RESTful and/or GraphQL)
Event Driven Development/Design/Architecture
Cloud Security
Kubernetes
Microservices/(event-)functions
Docker/Contained




It is much appreciated if you have experience with




KEDA
Dapr
Redis
MongoDB
Kafka
OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo
Schema standards, like OpenAPI or Avro

Front-end frameworks like Angular, React, Next, Vue, or Svelte…




We offer




The opportunity to work on innovative solutions with both a domain and the tech being most relevant for the future developer role
One of the best office spaces in Copenhagen, at Bloxhub, next to the canals
Fully flexible work options with remote, hybrid, and in-office solutions
An ambitious team that truly wants to make an impact
Industry-standard salary and the possibility of stock option intensives

Are you currently pursuing a master’s degree in computer science, mathematics, economics, or something similar – and passionate about data, automation, and hands-on analysis? Then we have an exciting student position waiting for you in our Data Services & Automation team and we’d love to hear from you.




Why Aleta?

Aleta is a fast-moving fintech company that empowers family offices, wealth managers, and advisors with a holistic wealth overview and unparalleled insights in a next-generation wealth platform.




By bringing all investment data into one place and offering advanced AI-powered analytics tools, our platform enables users to seize control and turbocharge their productivity.




We’re a tight-knit team of specialists in finance and software development, working in a dynamic and collaborative environment. We love taking initiative, hosting social events, and fostering a team culture where ideas thrive and innovation is encouraged.




What you’ll be doing ⭐

Our team works with complex data structures, automation of manual processes, and supports onboarding of new clients to our platform – often in close collaboration with both developers and business stakeholders.




As our new Student Data Scientist, you’ll become an integral part of the team and work with tasks like:

Analyzing transaction data and validating data quality.
Developing smaller automation tools and data models.
Developing and implementing scripts for onboarding flows and client reporting.
Supporting operations and troubleshooting data flows.
Contributing to documentation and systematization of solutions.
Assisting with development of ML-based tools or data mapping.

You’ll work on real tasks that create real value for both clients and internal operations – and you’ll get professional sparring from experienced colleagues with both technical and financial backgrounds.




What we’re looking for 🎯

You’re probably a great match if you:

Are currently studying a relevant master’s program (e.g., computer science, data science, math-econ, etc.).
Have solid skills in SQL and Python — and ideally some experience with Power BI or similar.
Are analytical, detail-oriented, and care about data quality.
Have an interest in finance and investment (no need to be an expert – curiosity goes a long way).
Are proactive, self-driven, and enjoy working in a team that values collaboration and high standards.




What we offer 🎁

A study-relevant part-time job (approx. 15-20 hours/week) with flexibility around exam periods.
The chance to gain practical experience with data work on a scalable fintech platform.
A key role in a high-impact, cross-functional team.
A steep learning curve and plenty of room to grow your skills in a real-world setting.
The opportunity to grow in the role – potentially joining development or operations projects over time.




Sounds like you? 🚀

If you’re excited about joining a bunch of passionate nerds who are building the future of wealth management software, we’d love to hear from you!




We’ll be conducting interviews on a rolling basis.

What’s more meaningful than seeing the real-world impact of your work?




Ok, maybe ending world hunger, but this is a strong second.

At OOONO, you’re not just building models in a notebook. You’re shaping the algorithms that directly power a physical product - used in real time by real people in the real world.

Join a small, collaborative team where you’re trusted to take ownership, test bold ideas, and push things into production. You’ll work hands-on with rich geospatial data to make our location logic smarter and faster.

And you’ll do it side by side with engineers, hardware specialists, and designers who genuinely care - about the product, the users, and each other.

What you’ll be doing

Develop and improve core algorithms to enhance product performance and user experience.
Contribute to map matching logic and road network analysis to improve location accuracy
Design, build, and maintain predictive models to solve complex business challenges.
Analyze large-scale data sets from Athena, MongoDB, and other sources to extract actionable insights.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Software, Hardware, UX/UI) to implement data-driven solutions.
Experiment with cutting-edge geospatial tools and frameworks to continuously improve analytical workflows.
Handle location data and geo spatial field.




We imagine you’re someone who has

A master’s degree in data science, geoinformatics or similar field
Proven experience (3+ years) in a Data Science role or similar, ideally within a tech environment and working with geospatial data
Proficiency in Python, including libraries such as Polars, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, Pyproj, Folium, Osmnx
Knowledge of geospatial analysis techniques (e.g., spatial joins, indexing, projections).
Strong understanding of statistical analysis, machine learning, and algorithm development.
Solid problem-solving skills and ability to work independently when needed
Hands-on person that can drive processes from A to B independently
English is a requirement.
Self-driven




How is it working at OOONO?

We’re glad we asked. It’s a nice working place. As in nice-nice. We have a relaxed, informal atmosphere and a flat hierarchy. Whenever you need a break from your important work stuff, you can get beat in table tennis, foosball, or just smalltalk about the weather by the coffee machine. We have monthly social events where we do anything from go-karting to going to festivals.

And when we’re not social? Then we’re pretty damn ambitious. We don’t like conservative targets or linear growth. We’re all about the extraordinary. This has led OOONO to become one of the fastest-growing tech scaleups and surprise-surprise: We have no plans of slowing down. So yes, OOONO is a lovely place to work, but it’s also a pretty good opportunity to develop as a person and take the next steps in your career.




The practical stuff

Start date: ASAP
Send your motivated CV to job@ooono.dk
Working hours: Full-time (37 hours)
Location: Gearhalsvej 1.1, 2500 Valby

How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?


The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process.

About the Role




Intellect Group is proud to be exclusively representing a high-growth, multi-sector organisation that has scaled from £0 to over £30 million in revenue – with ambitions to reach £100 million in the next five years.




We are seeking a Graduate Data Scientist to join the business at a pivotal stage in its growth. This is a foundational hire, where you'll be the first data-focused employee and have a real opportunity to shape the company's data strategy from the ground up.

The Opportunity:

Key Responsibilities:




Conduct a data audit across various departments and business units
Clean, integrate, and standardise datasets stored across different systems and platforms
Build interactive dashboards and visualisations using tools such as Power BI or Tableau
Deliver insights that support strategic decisions across operations, finance, HR, and procurement
Work collaboratively with stakeholders to understand their data needs and translate them into technical solutions
Contribute to defining a long-term data strategy, including infrastructure and tooling recommendations




Ideal Candidate Profile:




A recent graduate in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, or a related field
Strong working knowledge of Python and SQL
Exposure to data visualisation tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, Looker)
A genuine passion for data and solving real-world problems
Excellent communication skills and the ability to explain data insights to non-technical audiences
A proactive, self-starter attitude with a willingness to learn and grow




What’s on Offer:




A rare opportunity to build a data function from scratch within a fast-growing organisation
Direct exposure to C-suite executives and decision-makers
Varied, impactful work across multiple industries and business functions
Long-term career development and potential to progress into a leadership role
Supportive, entrepreneurial environment with room to innovate

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Machine Learning Engineer with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive. 

That's why, since 2016, we've been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they're at the heart of everything we do.

We've sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.

We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to play a key role in our Core Pricing team. You will drive innovation by optimising and automating Pricing processes to enable faster, more accurate decision-making. Your work will focus on developing and maintaining tooling and frameworks that enhance the efficiency of our predictive models, reducing deployment times, increasing scalability, and improving model performance through regular updates and monitoring. You will work closely with our Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product team to deliver scalable, production-grade ML systems.

Key Responsibilities


Build model lifecycle tooling (deployment, monitoring and alerting) for our predictive models (for example claims cost, conversion, retention, market models)
Maintain and improve the development environment (Kubeflow) used by our Data Scientists and Actuaries
Develop and maintain pricing analytics tools that enable faster impact assessments, reducing manual work

Job Summary

At Defence Equipment & Support (DE&S), we supply and maintain vital equipment and services for the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force. Together, we deliver a vast range of essential defence programmes, and strive for what's next. Because it helps keep our military at the top of their game and our nation safe – for today, and tomorrow.

We offer 25+ days’ holiday, flexible and hybrid working, enhanced parental leave schemes, shopping discounts, and an exceptional employer pension contribution of 28.97%, to help make work work for you.

Job Description

We are recruiting for a talented, motivated individual to join our growing multi-disciplinary team, with data analysis, data modelling, and digital engineering skills and knowledge.

As the landscape of threats and challenges evolves rapidly, our cohesive team must respond with a renewed focus on embedding technology into our operations.

We are working to reduce the time it takes to design and deliver equipment to the armed forces through the adoption of digital engineering techniques, to ensure the equipment we buy works as part of a coherent system with existing platforms within the UK Armed Forces, across NATO and with allies and industry.

To spearhead this transformation, we’ve established three Capability Centres. Each Capability Centre has a unique focus, playing a crucial role in developing our future transformative digital capabilities.

Through collaboration and innovation, this exceptional team will help us maintain our strategic edge over adversaries, both now and in the future.

The Capability Centres offer excellent opportunities to work with and influence senior management within DE&S and the broader Defence Enterprise, fostering new ways of working and embracing cutting-edge technologies.

We hope you will join us, to help develop these approaches and to utilise new technologies, modelling, and analysis techniques, to equip the UK armed forces with the edge to protect our nation.

The Digital and Data profession offer a range of on the job and structured training, however, if you already have experience and knowledge of other programming languages such as R, JavaScript, Python and SQL, it would be beneficial.

For security reasons this role is open to sole UK nationals only. A sole UK national refers to an individual who holds citizenship solely in the UK, without dual citizenship or nationality from another country. We’re unable to offer visa sponsorship.

This role requires you to have lived in the UK for the last 5 years and obtain Security Check (SC) security clearance. Clearance must be obtained without any caveats that prevent you from carrying out the role you’ve been recruited for. If it isn’t obtained or is obtained but with caveats that prevent you from carrying out the role, any conditional offer made to you will be withdrawn. Obtaining SC security clearance can be a lengthy process, and we reserve the right to withdraw any conditional offer made if the necessary security clearance isn’t obtained within 12 months.

We champion flexible ways of working. Regular in-person attendance is required to promote the benefits of face-to-face collaboration alongside flexibility of hours to support work-life balance. Initially, you may be expected to attend more frequently to familiarise yourselves with the site, the team, and your role.

Whilst on site, you’ll experience our impressive range of on-site facilities including a restaurant and coffee bistros and free parking. Our sports facilities include a fully equipped gym and sports hall with bookable classes, as well as tennis courts and a squash court.

What You’ll Be Doing


Perform complex exploratory data analysis using data mining techniques and develop and deliver algorithmic tools and solutions to business problems.
Utilise Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to draw insights from data whilst adhering to industry standards and best practices for development and version control.
Identify, define and propose options for the application data science techniques and approaches to decide the most effective way of meeting business requirements, in collaboration with Business Analysts.
Champion Data Science and applied methodologies across DE&S, presenting findings in a clear and concise manner, tailored to your audience.
Champion the knowledge of AI ethics development, evaluation, monitoring and deployment of data science solutions safely and understand the risks and how they can be mitigated.

Cambridge (1x day PW)

Up to £55,000

Health/MedTech

I’m supporting a long-standing client in Cambridge who have had some huge success recently and needs to scale their Data Science function to keep up with demand.

This is very much your traditional statistics-focused Data Science position. I’m looking to speak to people with around 2+ years of commercial Data Science experience, heavily focused on probability and statistics.

You’ll be joining a genuinely lovely and talented team. It’s an opportunity to use your skills to positively impact the lives of others. Health/MedTech experience would be a nice bonus, but certainly not essential.

Responsibilities:

As a key member of the data science team, you’ll provide statistical expertise for clinical research, designing and refining study protocols, analysis workflows, and data pipelines. You’ll help develop advanced methodologies and visualisation tools, collaborate with clinicians to enhance statistical processes, and partner with internal and external stakeholders to deliver data-driven solutions.

Essential experience:

Python.
Git for version control.
Classical statistics.
Hypothesis testing (parametric and non-parametric).
Survival analysis techniques (Cox regression, etc).
Linear or logistic regression models.
Exposure to small datasets, not just large (very important).

Desirable experience:

Familiarity with pharma/health/medical datasets.
Mixed effects models – ability to use matching techniques to create synthetic arms in clinical trials.
BSc or MSc Mathematics (statistics focus).




The office is located just five minutes from Cambridge train station, and you’ll only need to be on-site once a week (more if you wish), so it’s suitable for people who live a commutable distance from Cambridge.

Finally, in a world of 4-6 stage interview processes, you’ll be pleased to hear this is just 3 stages consisting of a 30-minute pre-screening call, one hour technical and a final culture fit interview, which is done in person.

Reach out to Jamie Forgan for more information.

You will have an understanding of how to implement technical solutions into client processes to effect real change. As a senior member of the team, you will be expected to support junior colleagues with mentoring, training and quality assurance. You will also be expected to contribute to defining and raising technical standards in the team and to scope out proposals and help win work.

As well as being an advanced Python user, you will be able to use SQL to extract and analyse data. A strong emphasis is placed on applying good DevOps principles and version control. Knowledge and experience of deploying solutions in the cloud (especially Azure) would be a plus.

You will be able to design solutions around client requirements and have an understanding of test principles.
