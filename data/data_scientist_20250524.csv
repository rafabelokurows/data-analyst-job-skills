We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Do you have a passion for deriving insights from data to make a difference in people's lives? Are you a Day 1 thinker who is passionate about pushing the boundaries of conventional talent development approaches and innovating on behalf of our customers? If so, we would like to hear from you!

PATOE is a centralized technology, data, reporting, and analytics organization that supports over a million employees globally, spanning support across NA Customer Fulfillment, Global Operations Learning & Development and PXT Capability & Impact, and Employee Relations.

We are seeking a DS who will lead new pioneering ideas from concept to reality and in this role—new bold ideas are always welcome. This DS will obsess over the Amazon employee experience and the employee voice across the organization. This DS will directly apply their knowledge to dig deep and help Amazon leaders gain actionable insights. Finding, prioritizing and resolving employee experience defects will be the mission every day. Thus, the challenge of this role is that it is never complete; we will always strive to push Amazon to be the Earth’s best employer.

The Data Scientist will play a critical role in advancing our mission. You will join a tight-knit team of PXT professionals, including HR, operational, program, product, tech and legal leaders. You will be supporting Amazon's World Wide Corporate, Consumer and Operations (WWCC & Ops) portfolio, and have direct impact on the daily work of over 1.3M+ Amazonians.

Our projects span multiple organizations and require coordination of experimentation, economic and causal analysis, forecasting, dashboarding and predictive machine learning tools. We’re looking for an enthusiastic technical expert and storyteller to explore the world of Amazon data to generate insights—connecting employee experiences to decision makers in a compelling way backed by data. Your focus will cover all aspects of how we learn more about our employees, uncover problems that need to be solved, and validate the impact of our solutions. You will work with other thinkers, creators, and communicators to build the skills of the entire team to create a research-driven organization. You will invent, refine solutions from start to finish—data sets, queries, models, reports, dashboards, analyses—to answer business questions while ensuring we are meeting the needs of the business and team goals. You will draw on your knowledge of data science best practices, big data management fundamentals, and analysis principles to build solutions that enable effective, data-driven business decisions. You will learn the business context and technologies behind your team’s data infrastructure and work with customers (e.g., researchers, economists, data engineers, business intelligence engineers, product managers) and other internal partners to ensure deliverables are aligned with expectations.

If you love getting to the “a-ha” moment, when the solution to a customer or employee problem reveals itself in the data— let’s talk!

Do you have a passion for deriving insights from data to make a difference in people's lives? Are you a Day 1 thinker who is passionate about pushing the boundaries of conventional talent development approaches and innovating on behalf of our customers? If so, we would like to hear from you!

PATOE is a centralized technology, data, reporting, and analytics organization that supports over a million employees globally, spanning support across NA Customer Fulfillment, Global Operations Learning & Development and PXT Capability & Impact, and Employee Relations.

We are seeking a DS who will lead new pioneering ideas from concept to reality and in this role—new bold ideas are always welcome. This DS will obsess over the Amazon employee experience and the employee voice across the organization. This DS will directly apply their knowledge to dig deep and help Amazon leaders gain actionable insights. Finding, prioritizing and resolving employee experience defects will be the mission every day. Thus, the challenge of this role is that it is never complete; we will always strive to push Amazon to be the Earth’s best employer.

The Data Scientist will play a critical role in advancing our mission. You will join a tight-knit team of PXT professionals, including HR, operational, program, product, tech and legal leaders. You will be supporting Amazon's World Wide Corporate, Consumer and Operations (WWCC & Ops) portfolio, and have direct impact on the daily work of over 1.3M+ Amazonians.

Our projects span multiple organizations and require coordination of experimentation, economic and causal analysis, forecasting, dashboarding and predictive machine learning tools. We’re looking for an enthusiastic technical expert and storyteller to explore the world of Amazon data to generate insights—connecting employee experiences to decision makers in a compelling way backed by data. Your focus will cover all aspects of how we learn more about our employees, uncover problems that need to be solved, and validate the impact of our solutions. You will work with other thinkers, creators, and communicators to build the skills of the entire team to create a research-driven organization. You will invent, refine solutions from start to finish—data sets, queries, models, reports, dashboards, analyses—to answer business questions while ensuring we are meeting the needs of the business and team goals. You will draw on your knowledge of data science best practices, big data management fundamentals, and analysis principles to build solutions that enable effective, data-driven business decisions. You will learn the business context and technologies behind your team’s data infrastructure and work with customers (e.g., researchers, economists, data engineers, business intelligence engineers, product managers) and other internal partners to ensure deliverables are aligned with expectations.

If you love getting to the “a-ha” moment, when the solution to a customer or employee problem reveals itself in the data— let’s talk!

Do you have a passion for deriving insights from data to make a difference in people's lives? Are you a Day 1 thinker who is passionate about pushing the boundaries of conventional talent development approaches and innovating on behalf of our customers? If so, we would like to hear from you!

PATOE is a centralized technology, data, reporting, and analytics organization that supports over a million employees globally, spanning support across NA Customer Fulfillment, Global Operations Learning & Development and PXT Capability & Impact, and Employee Relations.

We are seeking a DS who will lead new pioneering ideas from concept to reality and in this role—new bold ideas are always welcome. This DS will obsess over the Amazon employee experience and the employee voice across the organization. This DS will directly apply their knowledge to dig deep and help Amazon leaders gain actionable insights. Finding, prioritizing and resolving employee experience defects will be the mission every day. Thus, the challenge of this role is that it is never complete; we will always strive to push Amazon to be the Earth’s best employer.

The Data Scientist will play a critical role in advancing our mission. You will join a tight-knit team of PXT professionals, including HR, operational, program, product, tech and legal leaders. You will be supporting Amazon's World Wide Corporate, Consumer and Operations (WWCC & Ops) portfolio, and have direct impact on the daily work of over 1.3M+ Amazonians.

Our projects span multiple organizations and require coordination of experimentation, economic and causal analysis, forecasting, dashboarding and predictive machine learning tools. We’re looking for an enthusiastic technical expert and storyteller to explore the world of Amazon data to generate insights—connecting employee experiences to decision makers in a compelling way backed by data. Your focus will cover all aspects of how we learn more about our employees, uncover problems that need to be solved, and validate the impact of our solutions. You will work with other thinkers, creators, and communicators to build the skills of the entire team to create a research-driven organization. You will invent, refine solutions from start to finish—data sets, queries, models, reports, dashboards, analyses—to answer business questions while ensuring we are meeting the needs of the business and team goals. You will draw on your knowledge of data science best practices, big data management fundamentals, and analysis principles to build solutions that enable effective, data-driven business decisions. You will learn the business context and technologies behind your team’s data infrastructure and work with customers (e.g., researchers, economists, data engineers, business intelligence engineers, product managers) and other internal partners to ensure deliverables are aligned with expectations.

If you love getting to the “a-ha” moment, when the solution to a customer or employee problem reveals itself in the data— let’s talk!

Do you have a passion for deriving insights from data to make a difference in people's lives? Are you a Day 1 thinker who is passionate about pushing the boundaries of conventional talent development approaches and innovating on behalf of our customers? If so, we would like to hear from you!

PATOE is a centralized technology, data, reporting, and analytics organization that supports over a million employees globally, spanning support across NA Customer Fulfillment, Global Operations Learning & Development and PXT Capability & Impact, and Employee Relations.

We are seeking a DS who will lead new pioneering ideas from concept to reality and in this role—new bold ideas are always welcome. This DS will obsess over the Amazon employee experience and the employee voice across the organization. This DS will directly apply their knowledge to dig deep and help Amazon leaders gain actionable insights. Finding, prioritizing and resolving employee experience defects will be the mission every day. Thus, the challenge of this role is that it is never complete; we will always strive to push Amazon to be the Earth’s best employer.

The Data Scientist will play a critical role in advancing our mission. You will join a tight-knit team of PXT professionals, including HR, operational, program, product, tech and legal leaders. You will be supporting Amazon's World Wide Corporate, Consumer and Operations (WWCC & Ops) portfolio, and have direct impact on the daily work of over 1.3M+ Amazonians.

Our projects span multiple organizations and require coordination of experimentation, economic and causal analysis, forecasting, dashboarding and predictive machine learning tools. We’re looking for an enthusiastic technical expert and storyteller to explore the world of Amazon data to generate insights—connecting employee experiences to decision makers in a compelling way backed by data. Your focus will cover all aspects of how we learn more about our employees, uncover problems that need to be solved, and validate the impact of our solutions. You will work with other thinkers, creators, and communicators to build the skills of the entire team to create a research-driven organization. You will invent, refine solutions from start to finish—data sets, queries, models, reports, dashboards, analyses—to answer business questions while ensuring we are meeting the needs of the business and team goals. You will draw on your knowledge of data science best practices, big data management fundamentals, and analysis principles to build solutions that enable effective, data-driven business decisions. You will learn the business context and technologies behind your team’s data infrastructure and work with customers (e.g., researchers, economists, data engineers, business intelligence engineers, product managers) and other internal partners to ensure deliverables are aligned with expectations.

If you love getting to the “a-ha” moment, when the solution to a customer or employee problem reveals itself in the data— let’s talk!

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

You will build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for critical decision-making, along with self-service tools that empower business partners
You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing sales outreach strategies or building a sales forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for GTM analytics



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Revenue Operations, Finance, Growth, Marketing
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy



Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Sales, Customer Success, Revenue Operations, and/or Finance teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)

Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and X, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Role

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join the Money team at Twitch, which supports the systems behind creator payouts, payments infrastructure, and fraud detection.

You’ll work closely with product, engineering, finance, legal, and data partners to measure and refine our payout-related programs like the Plus Program and support new monetization initiatives to expand who can monetize on Twitch. While many changes are policy driven rather than AB tested, they require thoughtful measurement, reporting, operations, and causal reasoning.

This role is well suited for someone early on in their data science career who is eager to take ownership of high-impact, cross–functional projects and grow into a senior role. You’ll need to be comfortable with writing SQL, working with imperfect data, and flexing into data workflows when data engineering coverage is limited.

You Will:



Analyze and evaluate policy and program changes that affect how creators are paid
Own reporting and insights related to payout eligibility, earning, and program performance
Partner with cross-functional stakeholders to inform product and business decisions
Write, maintain, and validate pipelines to support recurring analytics and reporting
Apply causal inference methods to estimate the impact of payout changes



You Have:



1+ years of experience as a data scientist, data analyst, or a related field
Proficiency in SQL
Proficiency with Python or R
Understanding of Causal Inference concepts (ex/ DiD, matching, IPW, experiment design)
Strong communication skills across technical and non-technical stakeholders
High level of comfort creating dashboards



Bonus Points



Hands-on experience with Airflow, Sagemaker or deploying ML models in production environments
Strong familiarity with econometrics
Contribute to machine learning efforts in fraud or churn prediction
Experience Ideating, executing, and analyzing A/B tests.



Perks

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market.

Our work is ingrained in Brex's decision-making process, the efficiency of our operations, our risk management policies, and the unparalleled experience we provide our customers.

What You’ll Do

As a Data Scientist focused on Product Analytics, you will work closely with Product, Engineering, and Customer Success teams to understand the interactions between product engagement, customer retention, and overall customer growth. Your work will be instrumental in shaping product decisions by uncovering insights into how customers interact with Brex’s platform, identifying opportunities to refine the product experience, optimize user workflows, and introduce impactful changes that increase long-term customer value and drive sustainable revenue growth.

The ideal candidate has experience leveraging product intuition and advanced analytics to understand customer behavior, measure product impact on revenue retention and growth, and derive insights through causal inference and predictive modeling. They should also have a strong ability to translate data insights into actionable recommendations for product and business teams.

Where you’ll work

This role will be based in our San Francisco office. You must be willing to work in office at least 2 days per week on Wednesday and Thursday. Employees will be able to work remotely for up to 4 weeks per year.

Responsibilities


Develop and apply data-driven methodologies to analyze customer behavior, retention trends, and product adoption, focusing on how product changes impact long-term customer value.
Design and implement predictive models, causal inference methods, as well as experimentation strategies to measure and optimize the effect of product changes on customer growth and engagement.
Partner with Product, Engineering, and Customer Success teams to identify key opportunities for improving customer engagement and long-term retention.
Collaborate with Data Engineering to build scalable data pipelines that support product analytics and reporting.
Clearly communicate findings and strategic recommendations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


Requirements


Master’s degree or Ph.D. in Statistics, Computer Science, Economics, or a related quantitative field.
3+ years of experience in a data science, analytics, or related role focused on product analytics.
Strong experience with SQL and Python (or R) for data analysis and modeling.
Proficiency in A/B testing methodologies, causal inference, and predictive modeling.
Ability to translate complex data insights into strategic business recommendations.
Familiarity with BI tools (e.g., Tableau, Looker) and data visualization best practices.
Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work in a fast-paced, cross-functional environment.


Bonus Points


Experience working in B2B SaaS or fintech.
Experience in developing frameworks to measure feature adoption and identifying product opportunities that drive customer lifetime value.
Familiarity with product analytics tools (e.g., Amplitude, StatSig).


Compensation

The expected salary range for this role is $152,000 - $190,000. However, the starting base pay will depend on a number of factors including the candidate’s location, skills, experience, market demands, and internal pay parity. Depending on the position offered, equity and other forms of compensation may be provided as part of a total compensation package.

Automate high-friction workflows using Python, APIs, and lightweight tools.
Integrate Generative AI and LLMs to optimize and augment workflows.
Apply causal inference, forecasting, or A/B testing where necessary.
Choose the right surface for delivery—Tableau, Streamlit, Google Sheets—based on context and audience.


Who You Are


Bachelor’s or Master’s in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering).
2+ years of experience using data to solve product, marketing, or business problems.
Strong Python and SQL skills; write clean, maintainable code.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

We are seeking a data scientist with a background in economics to support our work to understand the economic impacts of increasingly powerful AI systems. As a member of our Public Policy and Data Science and Analytics teams, you will play an instrumental role in our company’s mission of building beneficial artificial intelligence by scaling our understanding of how models are being used across industries and economies. You’ll be building and scaling a data driven culture from the ground up, while building a body of work that will help shape public policy. This is a unique role, in a unique company, technology, and moment in history; your work will be critical to informing company and external stakeholders as we deploy frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with public policy leadership and societal impact researchers, as well as engineering and go-to-market leaders to define and measure key company economic metrics, analyze product behavior and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You will bring an economist's mind to your data science work, preparing internal and external reports that will inform how the world should think about AI’s impact on economies. With potential timelines for powerful AI systems as early as 2026, this role demands both technical acumen and strategic foresight. You’ve worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into user behavior data to provide insights to policy leaders and influence the company’s product, strategy, and policy priorities.
Define core economic metrics that measure how AI is being used in the economy. Set goals, build forecasts, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting
Identify and size opportunities to improve our societal impacts research and public policy agenda through your insights and recommendations.
Develop hypotheses on economic impacts of our products, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics.
Working with the policy team, write and publish internal and external reports on the economic impacts of AI that provide unique insights and perspectives on the usage of the technology.
Create data systems that can be responsive to inquiries from external experts and policymakers.
Build a data driven culture from the ground up by establishing foundational data best practices and making data more accessible across the company.


You May Be a Good Fit If You Have


6+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in a data infrastructure or operations context.
3+ years of experience of data analysis at the intersection of economics and industry
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI.
Background in public policy and economics
Expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective.
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress.
Demonstrate analytical capabilities in assessing policy implications of emerging technologies.
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions.
Experience in turning open questions and data into concise and insightful analysis.
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills.
Experience translating technical and data work to non-technical audiences


Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 - $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market. In compliance with pay transparency laws and in pursuit of pay equity and fairness, we publish salary ranges for our open roles.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.


The Role


Our innovative and technology-forward approach to risk management and customer support has been fundamental to how we invent and build financial products.

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

At Netflix, our mission is to connect global stories with audiences worldwide. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story or a game that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.

Beyond connecting global stories with existing audiences, we also aim to reach new subscribers and increase engagement through innovative marketing campaigns. By crafting compelling and targeted marketing strategies, we strive to capture the attention of potential members and convert their interest into subscriptions. Additionally, we focus on increasing conversation and excitement about Netflix and our content, creating buzz and anticipation that encourages both current and prospective members to explore and engage with our diverse offerings.

Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order; however, the Promo Media Algo team, with assistance from creative supervision and member feedback data, have built tools & processes that use technologies like Computer Vision, and Machine Learning to enable our creators to tell the best version of the story they want while allowing our studio to scale further.

Join us to be part of a team that is shaping the future of media and marketing at Netflix. We are seeking an experienced Machine Learning Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience to join our team.

Partner with our ML platform team to translate technical needs into infrastructure requirements, advocating for platform capabilities that enhance reliability, boost team productivity, and support our long-term vision for innovation at scale
Optimize systems and workflows for latency, throughput, and reliability across both batch processing workflows and real-time services to meet SLA requirements
Strategically identify and address technical debt to improve development velocity, while implementing tools and processes that enhance team productivity and code quality


About You

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 118 million registered users and 243,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 443+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.198.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Scientist to join our newly established Demand and Marketing Analytics team. In this role, you will play a pivotal role in enhancing marketing effectiveness through advanced analytics and supporting demand forecasting initiatives, ensuring our marketing strategies are data-driven and impactful.

As a Marketplace, Marketing is one of Too Good To Go’s most powerful levers for driving demand. Consequently, a strong foundation in marketing metrics is essential for this role. The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, your role may extend beyond marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Your role


Support business leaders in identifying and defining key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive marketing and business performance.
Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders to inform strategic marketing decisions.
Design and develop self-service analytical tools to empower marketing and other functional teams for operational excellence.
Create and implement statistical and machine learning models to evaluate marketing effectiveness and optimize campaign strategies.
Collaborate with marketing teams to understand their needs and translate them into effective models and tools.
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify drivers of demand and quantify the impact of marketing initiatives.
Create advanced analytical tools and models to enhance demand forecasting accuracy.
Contribute to broader data-driven projects, leveraging advanced analytics to support company-wide objectives.


Requirements


You have a minimum Master in econometrics, statistics, data science, or similar.
Previous professional experience in data science, with a strong focus on statistical modeling and machine learning.
Expertise in developing advanced models and analytical tools for time series forecasting and demand forecasting.
Familiarity with marketing mix modeling is a plus.
Understanding of marketing data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation, and Python for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and model development; R is a plus.
Hands-on experience collaborating with marketing teams, ideally in dynamic settings like hackathons, to deliver data-driven insights.
Great communicator and storyteller, adept at helping non-technical marketing audiences understand data insights.
Passionate about advancing analytical skills and fostering a data-driven culture.
Fluent in English, with excellent written and verbal communication skills.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer


An opportunity to work in a global social-impact company and certified B Corporation! where you can see a real and tangible impact in your role.
To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.
Work-life balance is important to us! Focus on the job to be done, not the hours spent, there is no need for overtime.
We trust in our employees and encourage an autonomous environment that provides several opportunities for employees to contribute, develop and take ownership of their work in a way that works for them.
To be part of an international company, with over 1,300+ colleagues across 19 countries that are on the same important mission.

Job Ref

A Movement for Everyone

We want to inspire and empower everyone to fight food waste together. With that mission, it’s only natural that we want to build a diverse and inclusive team of highly capable individuals who are passionate about doing things in a better way. We strongly believe we all excel and are more creative when we’re allowed to be ourselves, and we’re committed to a culture where all of us belong.

Over the past few months, and with a founding team consisting of Julien, second time founder with a PhD in materials science, and Katie, former experienced operator within the climate tech space, we have raised our first round of funding from leading investors, secured several letters of intent and demonstrated that we have a way of boosting the world's production of recycled copper.

We have developed a new wire-forming technology that produces high-conductivity copper wire without the need for 99.95% pure copper raw materials. No smelting. No refining. Just a smarter process.




By eliminating these costly and highly polluting steps, we are considerably reducing the overall cost of copper wire production, while making use of millions of tonnes of copper scrap currently unsuitable for electrical use. Our technology paves the way for fully circular and cost-effective copper wire production, making it an essential part of the global energy transition.

We’re now building our core team, and it’s the perfect time to jump on board.




About the role

We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in deep learning for predictive process control, to help us model and optimize our novel mechanical and thermal wire forming process.




You’ll take the lead on developing a model-based controller capable of anticipating system behavior and driving performance improvements in real-time. Your work will sit at the intersection of physical process modeling, data-driven algorithms, and real-world industrial systems.




Contract: CDI (permanent)
Location: Nanterre (hybrid)
Language: English fluency required. French is a plus but not required.




Your responsibilities

Develop and deploy predictive control algorithms to optimize mechanical and thermal processes for wire forming
Build hybrid models using deep learning and physics-based insights, incorporating process data and literature-based proxies
Design and implement efficient data collection pipelines from characterization methods to support model training and validation, to gather an optimized dataset
Simulate process dynamics, stress-test control logic, and run live tests on physical prototypes
Ensure the system is robust to uncertainties and ready for industrial scale-up




Ideal background

Engineering degree, MSc or PhD in Machine Learning, Control Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Material Science or related field
Strong hands on experience in model-based controlling and reinforcement learning for process control/material characterization
Proven track record applying deep learning to real-world physical systems
Proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, C++)
Familiarity with simulation tools (e.g., Abaqus, Ansys, Simulink, Modelica, or custom simulation environments)
Bonus: Experience working with manufacturing systems or industrial process control
Bonus: Demonstrated initiative in building and experimenting, whether through side projects, small-scale physical prototypes, or hands-on tinkering in a garage or lab




What we offer

We’re building a world-class industrial deep tech company, and we’re doing it from the ground up. You’ll be one of the earliest team members, shaping not only the tech, but the culture, direction, and impact of our start-up.




CDI contract
Competitive compensation + BSPCE package
50% health insurance coverage
Hybrid work model (office in Nanterre)




We believe deep tech needs deep diversity. We’re committed to building an inclusive, impact-driven team, and if you’re excited by our mission but don’t tick every box, we’d still love to hear from you. We value versatility and the ability to learn, which is absolutely essential at this stage of our business.




Let’s build the future of circular copper, together.

What’s more meaningful than seeing the real-world impact of your work?




Ok, maybe ending world hunger, but this is a strong second.

At OOONO, you’re not just building models in a notebook. You’re shaping the algorithms that directly power a physical product - used in real time by real people in the real world.

Join a small, collaborative team where you’re trusted to take ownership, test bold ideas, and push things into production. You’ll work hands-on with rich geospatial data to make our location logic smarter and faster.

And you’ll do it side by side with engineers, hardware specialists, and designers who genuinely care - about the product, the users, and each other.

What you’ll be doing

Develop and improve core algorithms to enhance product performance and user experience.
Contribute to map matching logic and road network analysis to improve location accuracy
Design, build, and maintain predictive models to solve complex business challenges.
Analyze large-scale data sets from Athena, MongoDB, and other sources to extract actionable insights.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Software, Hardware, UX/UI) to implement data-driven solutions.
Experiment with cutting-edge geospatial tools and frameworks to continuously improve analytical workflows.
Handle location data and geo spatial field.




We imagine you’re someone who has

A master’s degree in data science, geoinformatics or similar field
Proven experience (3+ years) in a Data Science role or similar, ideally within a tech environment and working with geospatial data
Proficiency in Python, including libraries such as Polars, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, Pyproj, Folium, Osmnx
Knowledge of geospatial analysis techniques (e.g., spatial joins, indexing, projections).
Strong understanding of statistical analysis, machine learning, and algorithm development.
Solid problem-solving skills and ability to work independently when needed
Hands-on person that can drive processes from A to B independently
English is a requirement.
Self-driven




How is it working at OOONO?

We’re glad we asked. It’s a nice working place. As in nice-nice. We have a relaxed, informal atmosphere and a flat hierarchy. Whenever you need a break from your important work stuff, you can get beat in table tennis, foosball, or just smalltalk about the weather by the coffee machine. We have monthly social events where we do anything from go-karting to going to festivals.

And when we’re not social? Then we’re pretty damn ambitious. We don’t like conservative targets or linear growth. We’re all about the extraordinary. This has led OOONO to become one of the fastest-growing tech scaleups and surprise-surprise: We have no plans of slowing down. So yes, OOONO is a lovely place to work, but it’s also a pretty good opportunity to develop as a person and take the next steps in your career.




The practical stuff

Send your motivated CV to job@ooono.dk
Working hours: Full-time (37 hours)
Location: Gearhalsvej 1.1, 2500 Valby
