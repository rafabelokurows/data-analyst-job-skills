Was passiert, wenn wir Risiken frühzeitig erkennen? Wenn wir Systeme bauen, die nicht nur reagieren, sondern vorausschauend handeln? Wenn ein Modell nicht nur Zahlen ordnet – sondern Orientierung gibt?

In unserem Team arbeiten Menschen, die genau solche Fragen stellen.

Weil sie wissen, dass gute Datenmodelle mehr sind als Code. Sie sind Verantwortung. Entscheidungshilfe. Und manchmal sogar ein Stück Sicherheit.

Wir suchen Data Scientists, die gestalten wollen – nicht nur technisch, sondern im Miteinander.

Die es schätzen, im Team zu arbeiten. Klar zu denken, präzise zu kommunizieren – und den Mut haben, Dinge weiterzudenken. Die wissen, wann man mit einem Modell beginnt – und wann man es loslässt.

Ob das auch zu Ihnen passt? Dann lesen Sie weiter.

Hier bringen Sie sich ein


Sie entwickeln Modelle, die Orientierung schaffen: Neue Kreditrisikomodelle entstehen bei Ihnen von Grund auf: konzeptionell, datenbasiert, verantwortungsvoll. Sie setzen auf Verfahren wie Prophet, LSTM, ARIMA oder XGBoost – nicht, weil es im Trend liegt, sondern weil es passt.
Sie halten bestehende Modelle lebendig: Gute Vorhersagen brauchen Pflege. Sie beobachten Veränderungen in Daten oder Rahmenbedingungen und justieren nach – präzise, nachvollziehbar und mit Blick fürs Ganze.
Sie denken über das Modell hinaus: Gemeinsam mit Kolleginnen entwickeln Sie neue Ideen für ML-Anwendungen – etwa zur Prognose von Prozesskennzahlen oder für intelligente Fachbereichslösungen, die Kundinnen wirklich weiterhelfen.


Das bringen Sie mit


Fachlicher Hintergrund: Ein abgeschlossenes Studium mit analytischem Schwerpunkt – z. B. Statistik, Mathematik oder Wirtschaftsinformatik
Modellierungskompetenz: Sicherheit im Umgang mit Time-Series-Analysen und Klassifikationsverfahren wie Prophet, LSTM oder XGBoost und idealerweise Vorerfahrung in der Kreditrisikomodellierung
Datenverständnis: Erfahrung im Umgang mit unbalancierten Datensätzen (Class Imbalance) und ein gutes Gespür für Datenqualität
Coding Skills: Fundierte Kenntnisse in Python und R – mit dem Anspruch, analytische Modelle sauber und produktionsnah umzusetzen
Kommunikation: Deutschkenntnisse auf C1-Niveau und die Fähigkeit, technische Inhalte klar, verständlich und zielgruppenorientiert zu vermitteln


Das ist für Sie drin


Intensive Einarbeitung durch erfahrene Kolleg*innen
Attraktive Vergütung und umfangreiche Arbeitgeberleistungen
Breites Qualifizierungsangebot zur fachlichen und persönlichen Weiterentwicklung
30 Urlaubstage bei einer 5-Tage-Woche; Verkürzung der Arbeitszeit (40 Std./W.) nach Absprache möglich
Hybrides Arbeitsmodell (mind. 2 Präsenztage/Woche) mit der grundsätzlichen Möglichkeit, aus dem EU-Ausland zu arbeiten

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Out humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

We've already:

✅ Mapped out workflows & designed the content database

✅ Validated the concept with early users

✅ Identified a massive market need

Now, we’re looking for a Co-Founder with NLP and/or Linguistics expertise to help shape the product, design language learning systems, and turn this into a transformative tool.




Why This Matters

Thousands of healthcare professionals want to work in Germany—but face serious delays and frustration due to language barriers. We believe AI-driven, contextual language learning, grounded in real medical communication, can unlock faster, more effective integration into the German healthcare system.




Who We’re Looking For

🔹NLP Researcher or Data Scientist or Linguist – You bring expertise in NLP, machine learning, or data science — ideally applied to language learning or linguistic data. You’ve worked with tools and methods like corpus-based learning, linguistic annotation, transformer-based models, embeddings, or libraries such as spaCy and NLTK. Experience working with German language models is a strong plus. You know how to design scalable systems that turn linguistic concepts into structured, personalized learning experiences. A background in applied linguistics, DaF/DaZ, or computational linguistics is a bonus, especially if you can bridge the gap between technical NLP and real learner needs.

🔹 Clear Communicator & Thinker – You can break down complex language ideas into simple flows and educational experiences. Bonus if you’ve worked on curriculum or content design.

🔹 Fluent German – B2 desired. You understand how non-native speakers struggle with German grammar, syntax, and domain-specific language.

🔹 Full-Time Commitment – This is not a side project. While we’re flexible on the start date, you’ll need to be fully invested—both in time and mindset.

🔹 Entrepreneurial Spirit – You're not looking for a job; you're looking to build. You’re excited by early-stage chaos, learning fast, and owning your domain.

🔹 Living in Berlin – Must be living in Berlin as of June at the latest







What We Offer

Early-Stage Salary – €2,500 month (gross). We know it’s less than market rate, but this is an opportunity to build something with long-term rewards.

Co-Founder Equity – Vesting-based ownership. You’ll have real skin in the game and share in our success.

A Culture of Learning – You'll shape the product, the pedagogy, and the technology. You’ll also grow as a leader and startup co-founder.




Next Steps?

1️⃣ Answer a Few Questions & Send Your CV – This helps us understand your background & mindset.

2️⃣ Review Our Pitch Deck – Learn about our mission, market, and vision for LingoMed.

3️⃣ Discussions & Next Steps – If we’re aligned, we’ll dive into product details, expectations, and how we can build together.

We are on a lookout for a hands-on Senior Data Scientist-Generative AI & Agents to join the Vendor Data Team on our journey to always deliver amazing experiences and go beyond prompt engineering into autonomous orchestration: designing agents that generate their own prompts, tools that empower AI with real-world actions, and judge models that validate outputs. Your work won’t sit in research notebooks — it’ll ship.

The Agentic AI team is building the next generation of AI-native products — intelligent systems that reason, act, and adapt. We combine the power of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to move beyond static prompts and chatbots into dynamic AI systems that solve real problems at scale. We don’t treat LLMs as tools to micromanage — we treat them as collaborators. Our products are designed to build and evolve themselves, leveraging AI to orchestrate workflows, make decisions, and continuously improve. If you’re ready to stop building brittle bots and start building AI that builds AI — this is your playground.


Architect and deploy agent-based systems using LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom frameworks
Build and optimize RAG pipelines — from smart chunking to embeddings and vector search - Fine-tune and evaluate LLMs for reliability, relevance, and factuality
Design evolving prompt and memory systems driven by LLMs and user feedback
Implement simulation and feedback loops using judge models or agent testing harnesses
Partner cross-functionally with product, research, and engineering teams
Stay current with the latest research in LLMs, generative modeling, and agent systems


What you need to be successful


Machine learning fundamentals (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning) - Data wrangling and preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
LLMs and NLP expertise (Transformers, BERT, GPT, etc.
Prompt engineering & fine-tuning
Knowledge of tokenization, embeddings, and attention mechanism
Using and fine-tuning Hugging Face models
Evaluation metrics for generative models (BLEU, ROUGE, faithfulness, hallucination detection)


Nice to have:


Open-source model experience (LLaMA3, Mistral, Mixtral) or custom inference stacks - Judge models, feedback loops, or synthetic user testing architectures
Familiarity with prompt injection defenses, output validation, or agent safety
Experience deploying generative AI in web or mobile products
Academic or industry background in statistics, cognitive science, or human-AI interaction

Familiarity with a cloud services platform, particularly for ML development and lifecycle; GCP fluency, specifically, is a bonus.
Strong analytical thinking and knowledge of the statistical foundations of ML, as well as practical experience developing models for tabular and natural language data; exposure to recommender systems or search applications a bonus.
Very strong proficiency in SQL is mandatory, proficiency in Big Data technologies (e.g. BigQuery, Hadoop, Flink, PySpark, Dask, etc.) is a nice to have.
Ability to translate business requirements into data-driven solutions.
Excellent communication and prioritization skills.




Your Profile:




You are comfortable in a role that straddles Data Science and software engineering.
You are excited about finding ways to improve our products with data and Machine Learning models.
You enjoy working independently, taking technical project ownership, and designing complete systems to solve challenges.
You are comfortable working at the interface between engineering, product, and business; being actively involved with the entire value chain around the models you develop.
You are eager to learn and research new methods, solutions, and technologies.
You love to work with data as much as you enjoy communicating your findings to an interested audience.
You are a strong team player and know that results come from great people working together around meaningful ideas.
You understand our mission and want to help us achieve it.




The Interview Process:




You will interview with several ResearchGate team members, including your hiring manager, potential teammates, and senior leadership. Your interview process will include experience-based interviews, technical challenges, and a Data Science case study.




Life at ResearchGate




You'll be working in an open and empowered company culture, with the chance to individually shape your professional development and growth.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Out humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

About The Role

Our mission is to build a world-class experimentation ecosystem. You will be at the forefront, researching cutting-edge methodologies, building proofs-of-concept (PoCs), and collaborating to bring these innovations to life. Your initial focus will be on critical projects like improving our test design methodology and rolling out ML-powered variance reduction methods into production. Future areas of exploration include advanced holdout strategies, sequential testing, variance reduction techniques, and estimating treatment effects in marketplace experiments.

This role is ideal for you if you’re interested in a mix of technical work and collaboration, and working on a diverse range of interesting problems across the company. If you think you fit this profile, but are unsure about whether you meet other criteria, please apply, and we can discuss!

Main tasks and responsibilities:


Research, prototype, and validate novel statistical methods for A/B testing and causal inference relevant to Bolt's challenges.
Develop PoCs for new methodologies, working closely with our two dedicated data engineers to support moving successful concepts into production.
Drive the democratization of experimentation by improving self-serve tooling, developing educational materials, and providing direct consultation to product teams.
Collaborate closely with engineers and product managers to translate advanced statistical methods into robust, scalable platform features used by hundreds of people across Bolt.
Work closely with Data Science and Analyst teams across all verticals to prioritize your research agenda and drive experimentation best practices throughout the company.
Effectively communicate complex statistical concepts and experiment results to stakeholders of different levels of data literacy when needed, from Data Scientists and Analysts, to Product Managers, Engineers, and leadership.



About you:


2+ years of experience working in the tech industry in a Data Scientist/Analyst or Economist role
Be able to translate novel methods from research papers on experimentation and causal inference into PoCs.
Deep understanding and practical application of Statistical Hypothesis Testing and A/B Testing / Randomized Controlled Trials (including advanced techniques).
Strong stakeholder management skills, notably collaborating with and influencing Data Scientists and Analysts.
Proficiency in R or Python (we work in Python, but this can be acquired) and SQL.
Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.
Accelerate your professional growth with unique career opportunities.
Get a rewarding salary and stock option package that lets you focus on doing your best work.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 118 million registered users and 243,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 443+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.198.000 tonnes of CO2e!

The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, your role may extend beyond marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Your role


Support business leaders in identifying and defining key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive marketing and business performance.
Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders to inform strategic marketing decisions.

Conduct in-depth analyses to identify drivers of demand and quantify the impact of marketing initiatives.
Create advanced analytical tools and models to enhance demand forecasting accuracy.
Contribute to broader data-driven projects, leveraging advanced analytics to support company-wide objectives.


Requirements


You have a minimum Master in econometrics, statistics, data science, or similar.
Previous professional experience in data science, with a strong focus on statistical modeling and machine learning.
Expertise in developing advanced models and analytical tools for time series forecasting and demand forecasting.
Familiarity with marketing mix modeling is a plus.
Understanding of marketing data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation, and Python for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and model development; R is a plus.
Hands-on experience collaborating with marketing teams, ideally in dynamic settings like hackathons, to deliver data-driven insights.
Great communicator and storyteller, adept at helping non-technical marketing audiences understand data insights.
Passionate about advancing analytical skills and fostering a data-driven culture.
Fluent in English, with excellent written and verbal communication skills.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer

To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.

Location: London, UK




Job ads are usually novels—we prefer conversations. But LinkedIn insists on words, so here’s the quick scoop on the role. If it sparks a grin, let’s chat over coffee (or google meets, pets welcome).




About upLYFT:

upLYFT is a VC-backed start-up redefining MSK care through clothing based wearables that augment human function. You will join the team to help deliver our first product MotionTrak, which combines sensors and textiles to monitor movement, gait and biomechanics- delivering insights for clinicals, athletes and the ageing. We move quickly and prototype obsessively!




Overview:

We are looking for a Data Scientist who will take end-to-end ownership of MotionTrak’s analytics layer—from raw sensor streams to production-ready algorithms. You will design signal-processing pipelines, build and validate machine-learning models, and work cross-functionally to embed your work in firmware, cloud and mobile applications.




Responsibilities

Own the signal pipeline – design, build, and maintain robust filtering, synchronization, and feature-extraction modules for multi-IMU data streams.
Develop movement analytics – develop algorithms that extract gait features, then turn these into actionable metrics.
End-to-End ML ownership – select and tune models for cloud analysis and longitudinal prediction.
Validate in real life – define study protocols, run data-collection campaigns, and perform statistical analyses to prove accuracy across diverse user populations.
Ship to production – collaborate with firmware, mobile, and cloud engineers to embed algorithms on cloud and integrate them into the full data stack.




Qualifications

Masters or PhD in Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Biomechanics, Data Science or a closely related discipline.
Deep understanding of digital signal processing, statistical modelling and machine-learning techniques, evidenced by publications, patents or shipped products.
Minimum 1–2 years applying quantitative analytics or data-modelling in a commercial or research environment.
Proficient in Python or MATLAB for building well-structured, version-controlled code bases.
Practical experience with IMU data, including orientation estimation, drift correction and sensor calibration.




Why upLYFT (a.k.a the fun bits)

Competitive salary plus meaningful equity in a rapidly scaling health-tech startup.
25 days paid holiday + bank holidays.
Real impact, fast – ownership and autonomy where code lands in the hands of users within months, not in a dusty backlog.
Lab playground – London office loaded with sensors, 3-D printers, and all the prototyping tech you'd ever need.
Passport stamps – Collaborate with partners in Japan and Hong Kong; optional travel if you fancy sushi + dim sum.
Backed to win – Supported by top UK & HK VCs who love big, audacious health-tech bets.




How to apply

Apply through LinkedIn or email careers@uplyftwearables.com with the subject line “Data Scientist”. Please include a CV and any relevant publications, GitHub links, or project portfolios. Although a cover letter isn't essential, adding will allow you to convey why you are best suited for this role.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a Data Scientist At Deliveroo, Your Main Goal Is To Maximise Business Impact Within One Of Many Business Areas. You Will Help Answer Questions Like


Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?


The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements


A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world.

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Overview:

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalization.

What you will be doing:

You’ll join a London-based agile team building and supporting data science products that drive business impact across PlayStation. You’ll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to serve teams such as marketing, operations, engineering, product planning, R&D, and finance.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Help drive data literacy across the business
Collaborate with a high-performing team of data scientists to apply insights and drive innovation throughout the company.


Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

These are global roles based in London, with occasional travel to partner teams in Europe, the US, and Japan — primarily to Sony offices in California or Tokyo.

Your impact and expertise:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.

We’re looking for someone who brings:


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience
Experience applying data science techniques such as supervised/unsupervised learning, segmentation, forecasting, causal inference, and uplift modelling
Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:


Experience with data science tooling (e.g., workflow orchestrators like Airflow, feature stores)
Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)
Private Medical Insurance
Dental Scheme
25 days holiday per year
On Site Gym
Subsidised Café
Free soft drinks
On site bar
Access to cycle garage and showers

Hybrid in London

The Company

Imagine a world where every small business has the power to thrive. That's the world we're building at iwoca. Small businesses aren't just statistics – they're the heartbeat of our communities, the character of our high streets, and the engine of our economy. Since 2012, we've revolutionised how these businesses access finance, turning what was once a lengthy, frustrating process into something remarkable: funding that's fast, flexible, and actually works for modern businesses.

Our impact speaks for itself: we've provided billions in funding to over 150,000 businesses across Europe, making us one of the continent's leading fintech innovators. But we're just getting started. Our mission? To empower one million businesses with the financial tools they deserve.

We combine cutting-edge technology and data science with genuine human understanding to make finance feel less like a barrier and more like a superpower. Whether it's managing cash flow or seizing unexpected opportunities, we ensure businesses get the funds they need – often within minutes.

The team

The Sales & Marketing (“Direct Acquisition”) team comprises our Marketing, Sales and Acquitech teams. We are responsible for reaching small and advertising finance to UK small businesses of all shapes and sizes. We do this through paid and organic marketing channels as well as direct sales.

We are an autonomous team with marketing, sales, software development, product, design, and data science team members. As a Data Scientist, you’ll work day to day with team members in all functions.

The role

As a Data Scientist in our Direct Acquisition team, you will play a crucial role working to set up and analyse tests, and to build statistical models. The data-driven insights you produce will help us develop strategies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales and marketing.

Strategy and innovation:


Work closely with the Head of Direct Acquisition, team and channel leads to ensure that your work aligns with business goals and achieves valuable commercial outcomes.
Design experiments to compare the performance of different strategies and evaluate them to inform decisions.
Share your findings and modelling with the wider business to impact our strategy.


Ownership and influence:


Independently build models to help solve our business problems, with responsibility for the solution design.
Promote analytical rigour within the team, ensuring that our experimental designs are correctly defined and that we evaluate tests without bias.
iwoca lives and breathes data, so data scientists have a key role in decision-making.


Development opportunities:


Join our community of analysts/data scientists/statisticians to ensure alignment in methodology across iwoca. You’ll be part of a peer group with whom you can discuss best practices or the latest advances so that you share and deepen your technical expertise.
Build expertise in Acquisition processes across the full range of marketing and sales activities.


The projects

Here are some examples of projects you might work on:


Setting up, monitoring and analysing split tests to help understand the value of marketing and sales activities. This could include determining the return on investment of different types of marketing strategies.
Building predictive models based on sales and marketing data, to determine whether certain activities lead to a positive return.
Building statistical models to enhance the ability of sales teams to do accurate forecasting and capacity planning.


The Requirements

Essential:


Strong problem-solving skills in probability and statistics.
Ability to dive deep into the business context and translate data into actionable insights.
Capability to manage projects end-to-end and produce good outcomes without much supervision.
Proficiency with data manipulation and modelling tools - e.g., pandas, statsmodels, R.
Experience with scientific computing and tooling - e.g., NumPy, SciPy, R, Matlab, Mathematica, BLAS.
Degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or equivalent.


Bonus:


Experience implementing solutions in a production environment (e.g., continuous integration).
Experience with Python. (Note: we mostly work in Python.)
Experience with Bayesian statistics.


The salary

We expect to pay from £60,000 - £90,000 for this role. But, we’re open-minded, so definitely include your salary goals with your application. We routinely benchmark salaries against market rates, and run quarterly performance and salary reviews.

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

The offices

We put a lot of effort into making iwoca a great place to work:


Offices in London, Leeds, Frankfurt, and Berlin with plenty of drinks and snacks.
Events and clubs, like bingo, comedy nights, yoga classes, football, etc.


The Benefits


Medical insurance from Vitality, including discounted gym membership.
A private GP service (separate from Vitality) for you, your partner, and your dependents.
25 days’ holiday, an extra day off for your birthday, the option to buy or sell an additional five days of annual leave, and unlimited unpaid leave.

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.

This role is for a talented Principal Data Scientist to lead the data science elements of PharosAI at Barts Health. They will join a growing team which is focused on AI and reproducible applications of healthcare data to deliver innovative health care products and services to the front line. Barts Health has been awarded £4.3m as part of £18.9m in funding from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to support the PharosAI project by providing expertise in AI development and ensuring that data from the Barts Health Data Platform as well as Barts' local tissue bank informs the building of the new AI models. These datasets will allow commercial and academic researchers to interrogate, develop and validate AI algorithms for the benefit of people in North East London, the UK and beyond. The project touches both on artificial intelligence and clinical patient benefit.

Interview date :1st July 2025

Barts Life Sciences is our programme for using research, innovation and technologies to transform health and care services. This covers a broad range of activities from discovery science, product development and testing, and the application of new technology. Life sciences in Whitechapel is firmly based on the principles of partnership and collaboration, with patients, a large number of highly engaged primary care providers, a wide range of commercial and other academic partners, local government and the local community. These partnerships will be founded on a common ambition and desire to achieve profound health, economic and social benefit for the people of east London, the UK, and internationally.

There is a requirement for the successful candidate to additionally cover the Barts Life Sciences Lead Data Scientist role as maternity cover. This will involve providing line-management to the existing highly-competent and experienced Data Science team until May 2026, when the incumbent Lead Data Scientist returns from maternity leave. At this point, the successful candidate will focus exclusively on PharosAI.

As part of Barts Life Sciences, the postholder will have access to data and computation power, knowledge and innovation to lead the project’s development and genuinely impact patient care. We have a close network of clinical teams across the Trust, research groups at Queen Mary University of London and engaged patient groups to priorities and spread project outputs.

Barts Health is one of the largest NHS trusts in the country, and one of Britain’s leading healthcare providers.

The Barts Health group of NHS hospitals is entering an exciting new era on our improvement journey to becoming an outstanding organisation with a world-class clinical reputation. Having lifted ourselves out of special measures, we now have the impetus and breathing space to chart a fresh course in which we are continually striving to improve all our services for patients.

Our vision is to be a high-performing group of NHS hospitals, renowned for excellence and innovation, and providing safe and compassionate care to our patients in east London and beyond. That means being a provider of excellent patient safety, known for delivering consistently high standards of harm-free care and always caring for patients in the right place at the right time. It also means being an outstanding place to work, in which our WeCare values and behaviours are visible to all and guide us in how we work together.

We strive to live by our WeCare values and are committed to promoting inclusion, where every staff member has a sense of belonging. We value our differences and fully advocate, cultivate and support an inclusive working environment.

We particularly welcome applications from Black, Asian and minority ethnic candidates as they are underrepresented within Barts Health at this band

Location: London

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Machine Learning Engineer with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

Since its start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World's Most Experienced Driver™—to improve access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, a fully autonomous ride-hailing service, and can also be applied to a range of vehicle platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has provided over one million rider-only trips, enabled by its experience autonomously driving tens of millions of miles on public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 13+ U.S. states.

The Simulator team builds state-of-the-art simulations of realistic environments for the testing and training of the Waymo driver. We use machine learning to model the real world, including realistic agents (vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists etc.), roads, traffic control systems, and weather. To increase the fidelity and steerability of the simulations, we employ large foundation models, trained on our massive datasets that allow us to quickly setup and rollout multiple scenarios to subject our driver to.

The team in London works with teams in Mountain View, California and Oxford, UK to build these foundation models out and to integrate them into several evaluation and training products. We are looking for research engineers to work on these exciting problems.

In this hybrid role, you will report to an Engineering Manager.

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive. 

That's why, since 2016, we've been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they're at the heart of everything we do.

We've sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.

Who we're looking for



We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to play a key role in our Core Pricing team. You will drive innovation by optimising and automating Pricing processes to enable faster, more accurate decision-making. Your work will focus on developing and maintaining tooling and frameworks that enhance the efficiency of our predictive models, reducing deployment times, increasing scalability, and improving model performance through regular updates and monitoring. You will work closely with our Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product team to deliver scalable, production-grade ML systems.

Key Responsibilities


Build model lifecycle tooling (deployment, monitoring and alerting) for our predictive models (for example claims cost, conversion, retention, market models)
Maintain and improve the development environment (Kubeflow) used by our Data Scientists and Actuaries
Develop and maintain pricing analytics tools that enable faster impact assessments, reducing manual work
Collaborate with the technical pricing, street pricing and product teams to gather requirements and feedback on tooling and to build impactful technology
Communicate complex concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders through clear storytelling

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.

The Company

Imagine a world where every small business has the power to thrive. That's the world we're building at iwoca. Small businesses aren't just statistics – they're the heartbeat of our communities, the character of our high streets, and the engine of our economy. Since 2012, we've revolutionised how these businesses access finance, turning what was once a lengthy, frustrating process into something remarkable: funding that's fast, flexible, and actually works for modern businesses.

Our impact speaks for itself: we've provided billions in funding to over 150,000 businesses across Europe, making us one of the continent's leading fintech innovators. But we're just getting started. Our mission? To empower one million businesses with the financial tools they deserve.

We combine cutting-edge technology and data science with genuine human understanding to make finance feel less like a barrier and more like a superpower. Whether it's managing cash flow or seizing unexpected opportunities, we ensure businesses get the funds they need – often within minutes.

The team

The Sales & Marketing (“Direct Acquisition”) team comprises our Marketing, Sales and Acquitech teams. We are responsible for reaching small and advertising finance to UK small businesses of all shapes and sizes. We do this through paid and organic marketing channels as well as direct sales.

We are an autonomous team with marketing, sales, software development, product, design, and data science team members. As a Data Scientist, you’ll work day to day with team members in all functions.

The role

As a Data Scientist in our Direct Acquisition team, you will play a crucial role working to set up and analyse tests, and to build statistical models. The data-driven insights you produce will help us develop strategies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales and marketing.

Strategy and innovation:


Work closely with the Head of Direct Acquisition, team and channel leads to ensure that your work aligns with business goals and achieves valuable commercial outcomes.
Design experiments to compare the performance of different strategies and evaluate them to inform decisions.
Share your findings and modelling with the wider business to impact our strategy.


Ownership and influence:


Independently build models to help solve our business problems, with responsibility for the solution design.
Promote analytical rigour within the team, ensuring that our experimental designs are correctly defined and that we evaluate tests without bias.
iwoca lives and breathes data, so data scientists have a key role in decision-making.


Development opportunities:


Join our community of analysts/data scientists/statisticians to ensure alignment in methodology across iwoca. You’ll be part of a peer group with whom you can discuss best practices or the latest advances so that you share and deepen your technical expertise.
Build expertise in Acquisition processes across the full range of marketing and sales activities.


The projects

Here are some examples of projects you might work on:


Setting up, monitoring and analysing split tests to help understand the value of marketing and sales activities. This could include determining the return on investment of different types of marketing strategies.
Building predictive models based on sales and marketing data, to determine whether certain activities lead to a positive return.
Building statistical models to enhance the ability of sales teams to do accurate forecasting and capacity planning.


The Requirements

Essential:


Strong problem-solving skills in probability and statistics.
Ability to dive deep into the business context and translate data into actionable insights.
Capability to manage projects end-to-end and produce good outcomes without much supervision.
Proficiency with data manipulation and modelling tools - e.g., pandas, statsmodels, R.
Experience with scientific computing and tooling - e.g., NumPy, SciPy, R, Matlab, Mathematica, BLAS.
Degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or equivalent.


Bonus:


Experience implementing solutions in a production environment (e.g., continuous integration).
Experience with Python. (Note: we mostly work in Python.)
Experience with Bayesian statistics.


The salary

We expect to pay from £60,000 - £90,000 for this role. But, we’re open-minded, so definitely include your salary goals with your application. We routinely benchmark salaries against market rates, and run quarterly performance and salary reviews.

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

The offices

We put a lot of effort into making iwoca a great place to work:


Offices in London, Leeds, Frankfurt, and Berlin with plenty of drinks and snacks.
Events and clubs, like bingo, comedy nights, yoga classes, football, etc.

Culture and values

We are guided by our shared values. It's not about finding people who think and act in the same way. These values help to guide our work and will continue to strengthen it.

Thoughtful

Thoughtful at Iso is about curiosity, creativity and care. It is about good people doing good, rigorous and future-making science every single day.

Brave

Brave at Iso is about fearlessness, but it’s also about initiative and integrity. The scale of the challenge demands nothing less.

Determined

Determined at Iso is the way we pursue our goal. It’s a confidence in our hypothesis, as well as the urgency and agility needed to deliver on it. Because disease won’t wait, so neither should we.

Together

Together at Iso is about connection, collaboration across fields and catalytic relationships. It’s knowing that transformation is a group project, and remembering that what we’re doing will have a real impact on real people everywhere.

Creating An Extraordinary Company

We believe that to be successful we need a team with a range of skills and talents. We're building an environment where collaboration is fundamental, learning is shared and every employee feels supported and able to thrive. We value unique experiences, knowledge, backgrounds, and perspectives, and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact.

We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Hybrid working

It’s hugely important for us to share knowledge and build strong relationships with each other, and we find it easier to do this if we spend time together in person. This is why we follow a hybrid model, and would require you to be able to come into the office 3 days a week (currently Tuesday, Wednesday, and one other day depending on which team you’re in). If you have additional needs that would prevent you from following this hybrid approach, we’d be happy to talk through these if you’re selected for an initial screening call.

Please note that when you submit an application, your data will be processed in line with our privacy policy.

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

What you’ll do

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Credit Detection brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s credit risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. Achieving this goal is critical to Stripe’s long term growth and profitability. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from credit losses that can put our financial position at risk.

The Credit Detection team consists of machine learning engineers who want to tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We work closely with our credit partners in product, business, data science, and operations to prioritize and drive our shared strategy. We are continuously exploring and undertaking new ideas and as an Engineering Manager you can have an outsized impact on the future of how Stripe manages risk at scale.

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers, product managers, and data scientists to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Support Experience engineering team builds and improves Stripe’s user support from end to end: how users get help within our products, how they get in touch with us when they have questions, and how our teams use internal tools to answer those questions. We’re accountable for the quality and reliability of this support stack and we use data and firsthand user research to continuously improve it.

Providing great support to users of all sizes is culturally important to everyone at Stripe. We are a group of friendly, user-oriented engineers that partner closely with Stripe’s world-class design, product, and operational teams. This includes the external-facing support interfaces (support.stripe.com), content, entry points, internal tooling, case routing, and helping product teams across the company reduce support volume by improving our products. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine support experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive.

What you’ll do

As a Machine Learning Engineer on the Support Experience team, you'll play a crucial role in enhancing our self-serve support experiences. You will be responsible for designing, building, training, evaluating, deploying, and owning ML models in production. For example, we apply LLMs to answer user questions with conversational agents and personalize product documentation, and are building automated systems to solve complex user problems. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers, product managers, and data scientists to operate Stripe’s ML powered systems, features, and products. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe and be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Design and implement state-of-the-art ML models and large scale ML systems for enhancing self-serve support capabilities, balancing ML principles, domain knowledge, and engineering constraints
Develop and optimize contextual conversation models and ML-powered resolution flows for common support scenarios, using tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and XGBoost
Create and refine pipelines for training and evaluating models in both offline and online environments, with a focus on improving support quality and user satisfaction
Implement ML features that streamline information collection and processing for support agents, enhancing overall support efficiency
Collaborate with product, strategy, and content teams to propose, prioritize, and implement new AI-driven support features and improve answer capabilities
Stay current with the latest developments in ML/AI, particularly in natural language processing and conversational AI, and apply innovative ideas to improve support experiences



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about building ML systems that touch the lives of millions. You have experience developing efficient feature pipelines, building advanced ML models, and deploying them to production. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, have a bias towards action, and thrive in a collaborative environment.

Minimum Requirements


Bachelor's Degree in ML/AI or related field (e.g. math, physics, statistics)
You have a strong technical background, including 7+ years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Proficient with ML libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, as well as Spark
Knowledge of various ML algorithms and model architectures
Hands-on experience in designing, training, evaluating & productionizing machine learning models at scale



Preferred Qualifications


MS/PhD degree in ML/AI or related field (e.g. math, physics, statistics)
Previous leadership or mentorship experience
Previous experience building ML solutions focused on support
Experience with LLMs and prompt engineering
Comfortable working with distributed teams across multiple locations and time zones
Proven track record of building and deploying ML systems that have effectively solved ambiguous business problems



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$193,500 - C$290,300. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

At Evident Digital, we’re transforming how dental labs and clinics operate—using smart, scalable AI to power the future of work. Our platform, EviSmart™, streamlines digital workflows across the dental industry. But we’re not here to theorize. We build fast, iterate faster, and launch products that solve real-world problems.




The Role




We’re looking for an AI Specialist who doesn’t just think big—but builds quickly. You’ll be hands-on with designing and fine-tuning AI systems that are multimodal and agentic—combining visual, textual, structured, and 3D data to enhance how people work, not replace them.




This role is perfect for do-ers who want to ship, learn, and evolve systems in production—not just research for research’s sake.




What You’ll Do




Build, fine-tune, and deploy models that understand images, text, 3D models (STL), and tabular data
Support development of agentic AI systems that take action and collaborate with users
Train and experiment with foundational models like CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, Gemini, and open LLMs
Work closely with engineers and product teams to deliver practical, scalable features
Build and maintain robust pipelines for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference
Apply new research in generative AI, LLMs, and multimodal ML—but only if it gets us to production faster




What You Bring




3+ years of hands-on experience in AI/ML, deep learning, or computer vision
Strong Python skills with tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Comfort with transformers, attention mechanisms, and other state-of-the-art architectures
Experience building with multimodal data (e.g. images + text + structured data)
A “get-it-done” mindset—you’re a builder who ships and improves in the wild
Bonus: experience working with 3D models (STL, point clouds) or dental/medical data




Why Join Evident




Work on real problems in healthcare—not hypothetical ones
Join a high-trust, low-ego team that values speed, impact, and ownership
Work from Vancouver’s tech hub with like minded people
Competitive salary, generous vacation, and full health, dental, and wellness benefits
Be part of a company that believes AI should uplift people, not replace them

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

At Evident Digital, we’re transforming how dental labs and clinics operate—using smart, scalable AI to power the future of work. Our platform, EviSmart™, streamlines digital workflows across the dental industry. But we’re not here to theorize. We build fast, iterate faster, and launch products that solve real-world problems.




The Role




We’re looking for an AI Specialist who doesn’t just think big—but builds quickly. You’ll be hands-on with designing and fine-tuning AI systems that are multimodal and agentic—combining visual, textual, structured, and 3D data to enhance how people work, not replace them.




This role is perfect for do-ers who want to ship, learn, and evolve systems in production—not just research for research’s sake.




What You’ll Do




Build, fine-tune, and deploy models that understand images, text, 3D models (STL), and tabular data
Support development of agentic AI systems that take action and collaborate with users
Train and experiment with foundational models like CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, Gemini, and open LLMs
Work closely with engineers and product teams to deliver practical, scalable features
Build and maintain robust pipelines for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference
Apply new research in generative AI, LLMs, and multimodal ML—but only if it gets us to production faster




What You Bring




3+ years of hands-on experience in AI/ML, deep learning, or computer vision
Strong Python skills with tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Comfort with transformers, attention mechanisms, and other state-of-the-art architectures
Experience building with multimodal data (e.g. images + text + structured data)
A “get-it-done” mindset—you’re a builder who ships and improves in the wild
Bonus: experience working with 3D models (STL, point clouds) or dental/medical data




Why Join Evident




Work on real problems in healthcare—not hypothetical ones
Join a high-trust, low-ego team that values speed, impact, and ownership
Work from Vancouver’s tech hub with like minded people
Competitive salary, generous vacation, and full health, dental, and wellness benefits
Be part of a company that believes AI should uplift people, not replace them

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.
