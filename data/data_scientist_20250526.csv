Responsibilities

​Partner with developers, product managers, and business partners to frame problems mathematically and in the right business context
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the problem
Construct and fit statistical, machine learning, or optimization models
Implement advanced analytics techniques to identify key factors impacting the quality and shelf life of fruits
Develop predictive models and machine-learning algorithms to predict the shelf life of different types of fruits
Design experimentation strategies for evaluating our models
Collaborate with developers to implement algorithms in production
Analyze experimental and observational data; communicate findings; facilitate launch decisions

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge.

You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing sales outreach strategies or building a sales forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for GTM analytics



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Revenue Operations, Finance, Growth, Marketing
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)

You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

Your insights will play a critical role in aligning risk management with business strategy and regulatory considerations.

The ideal candidate has experience in credit risk modeling, underwriting analytics, and quantitative risk assessment. They should have strong business acumen, deep familiarity with credit products, and the ability to communicate technical insights to non-technical stakeholders.

Work closely with our Credit Risk Machine Learning team to improve risk-scoring methodologies and loss forecasting models.
Support pricing and limit-setting strategies through quantitative analysis of risk-adjusted returns.
Design and evaluate tests to policy changes to measure the impact of credit risk strategies on financial performance.


Requirements


Master’s degree or Ph.D. in Statistics, Economics, Finance, Computer Science, or a related quantitative field.
3+ years of experience in credit risk analytics, underwriting strategy, or related data science roles in lending or financial services.
Strong experience with SQL and Python (or R) for data analysis and modeling.
Proficiency in credit risk modeling techniques, including logistic regression, scorecard development, and loss forecasting.
Familiarity with credit bureau data, alternative data sources, and regulatory risk considerations.
Ability to synthesize complex analyses into actionable business insights and communicate findings to stakeholders.
Experience with experimentation and causal inference methodologies.


Bonus Points


Experience working in B2B SaaS or fintech, particularly in a lending environment.
Familiarity with risk-based pricing models and financial modeling techniques.
Experience working with credit decisioning systems and automated underwriting workflows.

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools

Full-time / Onsite (5 days/week)

About The Role

We’re a telehealth company helping people lose weight at scale. Our internal team is core to delivering care—but scaling care delivery is messy, complex, and full of hidden inefficiencies. We’re looking for a Data Scientist who thrives on turning operational chaos into clarity. As a data scientist at Mochi Health, you’ll have the opportunity to work with and support various departments from marketing to operations. You’ll combine analytical thinking with engineering pragmatism—owning dashboards, automating workflows, uncovering bottlenecks, and building internal tools that let our team move faster with less friction. This role is ideal for someone who wants impact, autonomy, and real-world complexity.

What You’ll Do


Own the full lifecycle of operational metrics—from KPI design to dashboard deployment and stakeholder adoption.
Design metrics that drive accountability, surface inefficiencies, and guide automation.
Automate high-friction workflows using Python, APIs, and lightweight tools.
Integrate Generative AI and LLMs to optimize and augment workflows.
Apply causal inference, forecasting, or A/B testing where necessary.
Choose the right surface for delivery—Tableau, Streamlit, Google Sheets—based on context and audience.


Who You Are


Bachelor’s or Master’s in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering).
2+ years of experience using data to solve product, marketing, or business problems.
Strong Python and SQL skills; write clean, maintainable code.
Experienced in building dashboards (e.g. Tableau) and internal tools (e.g. Streamlit).
Curious, self-directed, and impact-driven—you chase high-leverage problems.
Clear communicator who can simplify the complex for any audience.
Comfortable with ambiguity and switching contexts in a fast-moving environment.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

We are seeking a data scientist with a background in economics to support our work to understand the economic impacts of increasingly powerful AI systems. As a member of our Public Policy and Data Science and Analytics teams, you will play an instrumental role in our company’s mission of building beneficial artificial intelligence by scaling our understanding of how models are being used across industries and economies. You’ll be building and scaling a data driven culture from the ground up, while building a body of work that will help shape public policy. This is a unique role, in a unique company, technology, and moment in history; your work will be critical to informing company and external stakeholders as we deploy frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with public policy leadership and societal impact researchers, as well as engineering and go-to-market leaders to define and measure key company economic metrics, analyze product behavior and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You will bring an economist's mind to your data science work, preparing internal and external reports that will inform how the world should think about AI’s impact on economies. With potential timelines for powerful AI systems as early as 2026, this role demands both technical acumen and strategic foresight. You’ve worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into user behavior data to provide insights to policy leaders and influence the company’s product, strategy, and policy priorities.
Define core economic metrics that measure how AI is being used in the economy. Set goals, build forecasts, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting
Identify and size opportunities to improve our societal impacts research and public policy agenda through your insights and recommendations.
Develop hypotheses on economic impacts of our products, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics.
Working with the policy team, write and publish internal and external reports on the economic impacts of AI that provide unique insights and perspectives on the usage of the technology.
Create data systems that can be responsive to inquiries from external experts and policymakers.
Build a data driven culture from the ground up by establishing foundational data best practices and making data more accessible across the company.


You May Be a Good Fit If You Have


6+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in a data infrastructure or operations context.
3+ years of experience of data analysis at the intersection of economics and industry
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI.
Background in public policy and economics
Expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective.
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress.
Demonstrate analytical capabilities in assessing policy implications of emerging technologies.
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions.
Experience in turning open questions and data into concise and insightful analysis.
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills.
Experience translating technical and data work to non-technical audiences


Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 - $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As an early member of our Data Science and Analytics team, you will play an instrumental role in our company's mission of building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence by driving marketing effectiveness through data-driven insights and analytics. In this unique company, technology, and moment in history, your work will be critical to informing our marketing strategy and optimizing our go-to-market approach as we deploy safe, frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with marketing, product, and commercial teams to define and measure key marketing success metrics, analyze customer acquisition and retention, and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You've worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable marketing analytics systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into marketing performance data to provide insights to marketing leaders and influence the company's marketing strategy
Define core marketing metrics that measure the team's success. Set goals, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting for campaigns and channels
Identify and size opportunities to improve marketing effectiveness, influencing marketing roadmap through your insights and recommendations on audience targeting, channel optimization, and messaging effectiveness
Develop hypotheses on marketing initiatives, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics
Develop a unified view of customer behavior across products through deeper analysis
Build a data-driven marketing culture from the ground up by establishing foundational marketing analytics best practices and making marketing data more accessible across the company


You May Be a Good Fit If You Have


6+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in a marketing or customer acquisition context
3+ years of experience deeply embedding in Marketing teams, turning marketing data into concise and insightful analysis that drives business outcomes
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI
Expertise in Python, SQL, and marketing analytics platforms and visualization tools
Experience with marketing attribution models across a variety of channels (SEO, Paid Search, Social, etc.) and A/B testing frameworks
Familiarity with both B2C and B2B/Enterprise marketing analytics
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions about customer behavior and marketing performance
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills, with ability to translate complex analyses into actionable marketing insights


Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 - $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Job Summary

Clinical, imaging, and genetic data at scale are powerful tools for biological discovery and risk prediction. Carefully structured analyses and reproducible analytic pipelines accelerate ongoing efforts to gain clinically relevant insights.

Our research efforts are at the intersection of cardiovascular disease and human genetics—including both somatic and germline variation. Our clinical research efforts employ new techniques for deep phenotyping, such as deep learning. But these techniques rely on a solid foundation of classical bioinformatics. The Bioinformatics Programmer/Data Scientist will assist in managing, cleaning, and analyzing large scale medical data using a wide variety of analytic techniques, both in the cloud and with on-premises compute depending on data permissions. Experience with a cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud is a plus, and ability to learn how to manage cloud-based pipelines, and to perform cloud data management will be essential to learn. Maintaining bioinformatic databases by obtaining and restructuring data, including both UCSF proprietary data and public data, and writing tools to streamline discovery and replication analyses using these databases will be core responsibilities. An important task will be writing and maintaining analytic pipelines in languages such as R, python, Go, Rust, shell, SQL, WDL, and/or other appropriate languages, and using tools such as Docker. Experience with databases or the ability to learn will be requisite. Under the supervision of the PI, the Data Scientist will also be involved in data analysis, and will be comfortable with bioinformatic analyses including variant calling and annotation. There will be opportunities to employ cutting-edge methods and to develop new methods. The ability to learn and implement new techniques depending on the problem at hand will be an essential skill, thus requiring a strong foundation in computer programming. This position will also include administrative duties and will have the opportunity to participate in—and to lead—authorship teams.

The final salary and offer components are subject to additional approvals based on UC policy.

Please note: An offer will take into consideration the experience of the final candidate AND the current salary level of individuals working at UCSF in a similar role.

For roles covered by a bargaining unit agreement, there will be specific rules about where a new hire would be placed on the range.

You’ll work in close partnership with technical and business stakeholders to ensure that data solutions provide measurable impact. This is an onsite role based in Arlington, VA, reporting to the Director of Business Intelligence, and embedded within the organization’s enterprise applications team.




Key Responsibilities:

Own and execute end-to-end data science workflows, from requirements gathering to model deployment and evaluation.
Transform, clean, and join large datasets to make them suitable for modeling—no data, no model.
Build, test, and deploy machine learning, simulation, and optimization models that drive real business value.
Deliver production-ready code that is modular, scalable, and minimizes technical debt.
Engage with subject matter experts to understand and solve targeted operational or strategic problems.
Contribute to the design of automated data science pipelines and continuous improvement of infrastructure.




Qualifications:

Required:

Bachelor's degree in a quantitative or technical field and 2+ years of experience, or a Master’s in Data Science or related discipline.
Proficiency in Python and deep familiarity with one or more data manipulation libraries (e.g., Pandas, Polars, Spark).
Experience preparing data for modeling: including ingestion, cleansing, transformation, aggregation, and profiling.
Ability to work autonomously, communicate technical concepts clearly, and manage multiple tasks in a fast-paced setting.




Preferred:

Hands-on expertise in Spark (PySpark) using the Spark SQL API (not Pandas-on-Spark).
Ability to build data visualizations using libraries like Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Altair, etc.
Familiarity with functional programming paradigms, unit testing, and software engineering best practices.
Experience with simulation modeling (e.g., system dynamics, agent-based modeling, or discrete event simulation).
Exposure to distributed ML/DL libraries (e.g., SparkML, PyTorch).
Familiarity with open-source Python optimization frameworks.

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

          <strong>About Blueprint<br><br></strong>At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.<br><br>Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license.

We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.<br><br>This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.<br><br>You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.<br><br>This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.<br><br><strong>What You'll Do<br><br></strong><ul><li>Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more</li><li>Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more</li><li>Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria</li><li>Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows</li><li>Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops</li><li>Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles</li><li>Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Who We're Looking For<br><br></strong>You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores.

Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and X, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog.

About The Role

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join the Money team at Twitch, which supports the systems behind creator payouts, payments infrastructure, and fraud detection. In this role you’ll focus on Payouts. Payouts is a high-leverage area that shapes how and when creators are paid and payout eligibility.

You’ll work closely with product, engineering, finance, legal, and data partners to measure and refine our payout-related programs like the Plus Program and support new monetization initiatives to expand who can monetize on Twitch. While many changes are policy driven rather than AB tested, they require thoughtful measurement, reporting, operations, and causal reasoning.

This role is well suited for someone early on in their data science career who is eager to take ownership of high-impact, cross–functional projects and grow into a senior role. You’ll need to be comfortable with writing SQL, working with imperfect data, and flexing into data workflows when data engineering coverage is limited.

You Will:



Analyze and evaluate policy and program changes that affect how creators are paid
Own reporting and insights related to payout eligibility, earning, and program performance
Partner with cross-functional stakeholders to inform product and business decisions
Write, maintain, and validate pipelines to support recurring analytics and reporting
Apply causal inference methods to estimate the impact of payout changes



You Have:



1+ years of experience as a data scientist, data analyst, or a related field
Proficiency in SQL
Proficiency with Python or R
Understanding of Causal Inference concepts (ex/ DiD, matching, IPW, experiment design)
Strong communication skills across technical and non-technical stakeholders
High level of comfort creating dashboards



Bonus Points



Hands-on experience with Airflow, Sagemaker or deploying ML models in production environments
Strong familiarity with econometrics
Contribute to machine learning efforts in fraud or churn prediction
Experience Ideating, executing, and analyzing A/B tests.

--

A global energy infrastructure company is seeking a highly skilled Data Scientist to design, build, and deploy machine learning and optimization models in a distributed computing environment. This role involves full lifecycle model development—from data preparation to deployment—and requires a strong foundation in data engineering, Python programming, and Spark (PySpark).

You’ll work in close partnership with technical and business stakeholders to ensure that data solutions provide measurable impact. This is an onsite role based in Arlington, VA, reporting to the Director of Business Intelligence, and embedded within the organization’s enterprise applications team.




Key Responsibilities:

Own and execute end-to-end data science workflows, from requirements gathering to model deployment and evaluation.
Transform, clean, and join large datasets to make them suitable for modeling—no data, no model.
Build, test, and deploy machine learning, simulation, and optimization models that drive real business value.

Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and X, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Role

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join the Money team at Twitch, which supports the systems behind creator payouts, payments infrastructure, and fraud detection. In this role you’ll focus on Payouts. Payouts is a high-leverage area that shapes how and when creators are paid and payout eligibility.

You’ll work closely with product, engineering, finance, legal, and data partners to measure and refine our payout-related programs like the Plus Program and support new monetization initiatives to expand who can monetize on Twitch. While many changes are policy driven rather than AB tested, they require thoughtful measurement, reporting, operations, and causal reasoning.

This role is well suited for someone early on in their data science career who is eager to take ownership of high-impact, cross–functional projects and grow into a senior role. You’ll need to be comfortable with writing SQL, working with imperfect data, and flexing into data workflows when data engineering coverage is limited.

You can work in San Francisco, CA; Irvine, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA

You Will:



Analyze and evaluate policy and program changes that affect how creators are paid
Own reporting and insights related to payout eligibility, earning, and program performance
Partner with cross-functional stakeholders to inform product and business decisions
Write, maintain, and validate pipelines to support recurring analytics and reporting
Apply causal inference methods to estimate the impact of payout changes



You Have:



1+ years of experience as a data scientist, data analyst, or a related field
Proficiency in SQL
Proficiency with Python or R
Understanding of Causal Inference concepts (ex/ DiD, matching, IPW, experiment design)
Strong communication skills across technical and non-technical stakeholders
High level of comfort creating dashboards



Bonus Points



Hands-on experience with Airflow, Sagemaker or deploying ML models in production environments
Strong familiarity with econometrics
Contribute to machine learning efforts in fraud or churn prediction
Experience Ideating, executing, and analyzing A/B tests.



Perks



Medical, Dental, Vision & Disability Insurance
401(k)
Maternity & Parental Leave
Flexible PTO
Amazon Employee Discount

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers

At Blueprint, we're on a mission to empower therapists with world-class tools so they can focus on what matters most—delivering exceptional mental health care.

Our AI assistant is purpose-built for therapists, automating the administrative tasks that slow them down and enabling them to operate at the top of their license. With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.

Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.

Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.

We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.

About The Role

We're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on — it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.

This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what ""good"" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.

You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.

This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.

What You'll Do


Design and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and more
Define and implement application-specific quality metrics — not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and more
Collaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteria
Monitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflows
Build tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loops
Work closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cycles
Help shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworks



Who We're Looking For

You're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used — not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.

You might be a fit if:


You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI products
You have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelines
You think in terms of feedback loops — and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metrics
You write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowing
You're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what ""good"" means in a real-world AI application


Bonus if you have:


Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environments
Familiarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scale
A strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices — and a willingness to invent new ones where needed



Benefits


Competitive salary and equity
100% remote - no office, no commuting
Health, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by Blueprint
Semi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)
Unlimited PTO
Opportunities to grow with the company and shape our product
Hardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkers
