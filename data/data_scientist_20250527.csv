As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.
Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partners - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com) and Jaksa Marojevic (jaksa.marojevic@external.wolt.com)

Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Merchant Group At Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business.

The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.
Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partners - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com) and Jaksa Marojevic (jaksa.marojevic@external.wolt.com)

Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 118 million registered users and 243,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 443+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.198.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Scientist to join our newly established Demand and Marketing Analytics team. In this role, you will play a pivotal role in enhancing marketing effectiveness through advanced analytics and supporting demand forecasting initiatives, ensuring our marketing strategies are data-driven and impactful.

The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, your role may extend beyond marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Your role


Support business leaders in identifying and defining key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive marketing and business performance.
Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders to inform strategic marketing decisions.
Design and develop self-service analytical tools to empower marketing and other functional teams for operational excellence.
Create and implement statistical and machine learning models to evaluate marketing effectiveness and optimize campaign strategies.
Collaborate with marketing teams to understand their needs and translate them into effective models and tools.
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify drivers of demand and quantify the impact of marketing initiatives.
Create advanced analytical tools and models to enhance demand forecasting accuracy.
Contribute to broader data-driven projects, leveraging advanced analytics to support company-wide objectives.


Requirements


You have a minimum Master in econometrics, statistics, data science, or similar.
Previous professional experience in data science, with a strong focus on statistical modeling and machine learning.
Expertise in developing advanced models and analytical tools for time series forecasting and demand forecasting.
Familiarity with marketing mix modeling is a plus.
Understanding of marketing data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation, and Python for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and model development; R is a plus.
Hands-on experience collaborating with marketing teams, ideally in dynamic settings like hackathons, to deliver data-driven insights.
Great communicator and storyteller, adept at helping non-technical marketing audiences understand data insights.
Passionate about advancing analytical skills and fostering a data-driven culture.
Fluent in English, with excellent written and verbal communication skills.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.

To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Overview:

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalization.

What you will be doing:

You’ll join a London-based agile team building and supporting data science products that drive business impact across PlayStation. You’ll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to serve teams such as marketing, operations, engineering, product planning, R&D, and finance.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Help drive data literacy across the business
Collaborate with a high-performing team of data scientists to apply insights and drive innovation throughout the company.


Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

These are global roles based in London, with occasional travel to partner teams in Europe, the US, and Japan — primarily to Sony offices in California or Tokyo.

Your impact and expertise:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.

We’re looking for someone who brings:


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience
Experience applying data science techniques such as supervised/unsupervised learning, segmentation, forecasting, causal inference, and uplift modelling
Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:


Experience with data science tooling (e.g., workflow orchestrators like Airflow, feature stores)
Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)
Private Medical Insurance
Dental Scheme
25 days holiday per year
On Site Gym
Subsidised Café
Free soft drinks
On site bar
Access to cycle garage and showers

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.




Vertex Search is acting as a recruitment agency on this assignment.

This role is for a talented Principal Data Scientist to lead the data science elements of PharosAI at Barts Health. They will join a growing team which is focused on AI and reproducible applications of healthcare data to deliver innovative health care products and services to the front line. Barts Health has been awarded £4.3m as part of £18.9m in funding from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to support the PharosAI project by providing expertise in AI development and ensuring that data from the Barts Health Data Platform as well as Barts' local tissue bank informs the building of the new AI models.

The project touches both on artificial intelligence and clinical patient benefit.

Interview date :1st July 2025

Barts Life Sciences is our programme for using research, innovation and technologies to transform health and care services. This covers a broad range of activities from discovery science, product development and testing, and the application of new technology. Life sciences in Whitechapel is firmly based on the principles of partnership and collaboration, with patients, a large number of highly engaged primary care providers, a wide range of commercial and other academic partners, local government and the local community. These partnerships will be founded on a common ambition and desire to achieve profound health, economic and social benefit for the people of east London, the UK, and internationally.

There is a requirement for the successful candidate to additionally cover the Barts Life Sciences Lead Data Scientist role as maternity cover. This will involve providing line-management to the existing highly-competent and experienced Data Science team until May 2026, when the incumbent Lead Data Scientist returns from maternity leave. At this point, the successful candidate will focus exclusively on PharosAI.

As part of Barts Life Sciences, the postholder will have access to data and computation power, knowledge and innovation to lead the project’s development and genuinely impact patient care. We have a close network of clinical teams across the Trust, research groups at Queen Mary University of London and engaged patient groups to priorities and spread project outputs.

Barts Health is one of the largest NHS trusts in the country, and one of Britain’s leading healthcare providers.

The Barts Health group of NHS hospitals is entering an exciting new era on our improvement journey to becoming an outstanding organisation with a world-class clinical reputation. Having lifted ourselves out of special measures, we now have the impetus and breathing space to chart a fresh course in which we are continually striving to improve all our services for patients.

Our vision is to be a high-performing group of NHS hospitals, renowned for excellence and innovation, and providing safe and compassionate care to our patients in east London and beyond. That means being a provider of excellent patient safety, known for delivering consistently high standards of harm-free care and always caring for patients in the right place at the right time. It also means being an outstanding place to work, in which our WeCare values and behaviours are visible to all and guide us in how we work together.

We strive to live by our WeCare values and are committed to promoting inclusion, where every staff member has a sense of belonging. We value our differences and fully advocate, cultivate and support an inclusive working environment.

We particularly welcome applications from Black, Asian and minority ethnic candidates as they are underrepresented within Barts Health at this band

Location: London

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Machine Learning Engineer with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

We believe that everyone can have equal and unconstrained access to educational experiences on par with Oxford, Cambridge, CalTech, et cetera. We believe that this can be achieved with a new class of learning tools, which combine advances in cognitive science, language models, and datasets. We are building these tools in England.

Our first product, Grasp Concepts, enables students to disambiguate and learn concepts through great online explanations and is deployed with design partners including Imperial College London. Our second product, Grasp Pathways, decomposes learning goals and suggests flexible learning trajectories to reach them, using reputable learning resources like books and lectures, and is in private alpha. An on-demand, online oxbridge-like experience.

Team and Funding

We've raised significant capital from top tier investors including Balderton Capital, Mozilla (yes, Firefox), and Point9. Our founder Ed built the Payments and Trading products at Revolut alongside his bachelors and masters degrees. He was also one of a handful of investors at DST Global. Our team have backgrounds in elite institutions including Revolut, Huawei, Max-Planck Institute, Oxford, and Cambridge. We're building something so hard we cannot afford to work with anyone but the best.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive. 

That's why, since 2016, we've been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they're at the heart of everything we do.

We've sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.

Who we're looking for



We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to play a key role in our Core Pricing team. You will drive innovation by optimising and automating Pricing processes to enable faster, more accurate decision-making. Your work will focus on developing and maintaining tooling and frameworks that enhance the efficiency of our predictive models, reducing deployment times, increasing scalability, and improving model performance through regular updates and monitoring. You will work closely with our Data Scientists, Actuaries, and Product team to deliver scalable, production-grade ML systems.

Key Responsibilities


Build model lifecycle tooling (deployment, monitoring and alerting) for our predictive models (for example claims cost, conversion, retention, market models)
Maintain and improve the development environment (Kubeflow) used by our Data Scientists and Actuaries
Develop and maintain pricing analytics tools that enable faster impact assessments, reducing manual work
Collaborate with the technical pricing, street pricing and product teams to gather requirements and feedback on tooling and to build impactful technology

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.

About RAPP

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

Role

Are you an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modelling, programming, and business problem-solving? Do you thrive on learning fast, solving real-world problems, and making an impact from day one? We’re looking for a Junior Machine Learning Engineer with a growth mindset and a solid grasp of data science fundamentals to join our world-class team at RAPP. You’ll support senior team members in delivering machine learning and advanced analytics solutions for global brands like Ralph Lauren, KFC, and Mercedes. This role is perfect for someone at the start of their career who is passionate about applying their skills to commercial challenges and growing rapidly in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. You’ll be joining a team led by George Cushen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cushen/ ), known for delivering innovative AI solutions at scale across marketing and customer experience.

What You’ll Do


Support the development of predictive models and data-driven solutions that solve real marketing and customer problems.
Conduct exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data cleaning to prepare data for modelling.
Write clean, well-documented Python and SQL code to support analysis and model development.
Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to turn insights into business recommendations.
Communicate findings clearly to internal stakeholders – both technical and non-technical.
Learn quickly and continuously – from new tools and techniques to client domains and business challenges.


Must-Have

What You’ll Bring


A strong foundation in statistics, probability, and machine learning fundamentals – either through a STEM degree, formal training, or self-study.
Fluency in Python and SQL, including experience with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or equivalent.
Demonstrated ability to solve real-world problems pragmatically using data.
Clear, structured communication – especially the ability to explain complex topics simply.
A growth mindset: curious, driven, humble, and eager to learn from others.
Business acumen and commercial awareness – able to think critically about the impact of your work.


Nice-to-Have


Experience working on live projects in a business setting – e.g., internships, grad schemes, or startups.
Familiarity with cloud tools (AWS, GCP, etc.) or version control (Git).
Exposure to A/B testing, forecasting, causal AI, or graph AI.
Experience working with marketing or customer-level datasets.


Why This Role is Different

This is not your average junior role. You won’t be stuck doing just data cleaning or dashboards – you’ll work on real projects, build models, contribute ideas, and grow under the mentorship of a senior, highly experienced team. This is the perfect launchpad for someone who wants to accelerate their career in data science within a global creative agency

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions.

Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations

Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$142,400 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

Carta connects founders, investors, and limited partners through world-class software, purpose-built for everyone in venture capital, private equity and private credit.

Carta’s fund administration platform supports nearly 7,000 funds and SPVs, representing $150B in assets under administration in venture capital and private equity. Trusted by more than 40,000 companies, Carta also helps private businesses in over 160 countries manage their cap tables, valuations, taxes, equity programs, compensation, and more.

Together, Carta is creating the end-to-end ERP platform for private markets. Traditional ERP solutions don’t work for Private Funds. Private capital markets need a comprehensive software solution to replace outdated spreadsheets and fragmented service providers. Carta’s software for the Office of the Fund CFO does just that - it’s a new category of software to make private markets look more like public markets - a connected ERP for private capital.

Evident is changing how dental clinics and labs operate—digitally and intelligently. Our flagship platform, EviSmart™, empowers dental professionals through smarter workflows powered by AI. We’re not here for theoretical research—we’re building real AI for real users in a high-impact industry.




The Role




We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who loves shipping real-world AI features. This isn’t a role for ivory-tower researchers—we want someone who can take an idea from notebook to production. You’ll build models that work with multimodal data—images, clinical text, 3D dental files—and make them run smoothly in a production SaaS platform.




If you’re a builder, a problem-solver, and someone who thrives on seeing your work in the hands of users—this one’s for you.




What You’ll Do




Design, train, and deploy machine learning models for classification, detection, and multimodal tasks
Work with 3D scans (STL), dental images, product specs, and clinical notes
Fine-tune models like CLIP, BLIP, open LLMs, and vision transformers for practical use
Develop production-grade ML pipelines—data preprocessing, evaluation, monitoring, and inference
Collaborate closely with product, design, and full-stack teams to ship fast and iterate
Monitor and improve model performance in real-world conditions




What You Bring




3+ years of experience in machine learning or applied AI roles
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace
Experience deploying models in production (bonus if you’ve worked in a SaaS or healthtech environment)
Comfort working with real-world, messy datasets and finding ways to make them useful
Understanding of transformer architectures, CNNs, or diffusion models
Bonus: experience with 3D modeling, STL files, or dental/medical imaging




Why You’ll Love It Here




Be part of a company that’s scaling with purpose—our AI directly supports better dental care
A low-ego, high-execution team that values action over perfection
Great benefits: health, dental and vacation
You’ll actually ship. Often.




Let’s Build Something That Matters




Join us if you’re ready to turn models into impact—not just experiments.

Carta connects founders, investors, and limited partners through world-class software, purpose-built for everyone in venture capital, private equity and private credit.

Carta’s fund administration platform supports nearly 7,000 funds and SPVs, representing $150B in assets under administration in venture capital and private equity. Trusted by more than 40,000 companies, Carta also helps private businesses in over 160 countries manage their cap tables, valuations, taxes, equity programs, compensation, and more.

Together, Carta is creating the end-to-end ERP platform for private markets. Traditional ERP solutions don’t work for Private Funds. Private capital markets need a comprehensive software solution to replace outdated spreadsheets and fragmented service providers. Carta’s software for the Office of the Fund CFO does just that - it’s a new category of software to make private markets look more like public markets - a connected ERP for private capital.

Thrives in a fast-paced environment with multiple priorities. You don’t break a sweat under pressure—because you’re just that good.

Benefits:

Competitive salary and benefits (we pay well so you can focus on the fun stuff).
Career growth opportunities that’ll make your professional life as exciting as your work.
A collaborative, innovative environment that supports and challenges you.
Flexible working hours (work hard, but on your own terms).

At Mogo, we’re reimagining the future of personal finance by embedding AI as the foundation — not as a layer. We're building intelligent, self-optimizing systems that aim to help millions of Canadians invest more intelligently and access credit more responsibly. Our platform is designed to break the cycle of short-term thinking in wealth and lending by combining proven value-investing principles with cutting-edge technology.

We’re building an elite platform for the next generation — one that helps Canadians graduate from stock gambling, underperforming funds, and high-fee advisors. By embedding intelligence into every layer of the product, we’re creating something that’s transparent, scalable, and truly transformative.

If you're a full stack builder who wants to go beyond ""using AI"" and help create a fintech that is built on AI, we want to talk.

The Role: Full Stack AI Engineer

We're looking for a product-minded engineer who can:


Move fast like a startup dev
Architect and ship production-grade systems
Build LLM-native, intelligent workflows
Help lead the evolution of Mogo into an AI-first platform


You’ll drive development across backend systems and LLM agent orchestration, contributing to features that are autonomous, adaptive, and self-optimizing.

The base salary for this role is $115,000 – $150,000 CAD

What You’ll Build


Production-Grade AI Systems Deploy and maintain LLM-powered systems in production environments with clear SLAs, observability, and fallback strategies. Focus on scalability, latency, throughput, and reliability to ensure AI services deliver real business value
AI-Native Workflows Design and ship agent-based flows across onboarding, support, credit decisioning, and payments. You'll help build a self-serve credit experience that gets smarter with every user interaction, improving decisioning, repayments, and personalization through intelligence. Work cross-functionally with Product, Design, and Compliance to ensure these flows drive real outcomes and align with regulatory standards
LLM Integrations Work with OpenAI, Claude, LangChain,, and other tools to build intelligent experiences. These include LLM-powered education tools and conversational interfaces that guide users through investing and credit decisions. Participate in architectural design discussions that center on securely and efficiently integrating LLM systems into production environments. Stay current with the latest AI advancements and evaluate emerging tools and frameworks that can advance our product
End-to-End Features Develop full stack features with real impact—from backend APIs and microservices in Node.js/TypeScript to intelligent frontends in React or React Native—supporting personalized, AI-powered finance journeys. Champion best practices in testing, deployment, and code quality through modern development workflows (TDD, CI/CD, AI-driven testing)
Autonomous Infrastructure Replace manual ops with AI-driven systems that don’t just assist, but autonomously take action. Your work will enable a high-performance fintech operation that’s lean, scalable, and largely self-managing
Scalable Intelligence Architect systems for continuous learning, observability, and performance. Define and monitor AI performance metrics to assess model behavior, user impact, and long-term value. Your solutions will support both a smarter lending platform and a next-generation investing experience grounded in value-investing principles and real-time data
AI-Optimized Engineering Practices Contribute to a culture of technical excellence by participating in code reviews, mentoring peers in AI-native engineering approaches, and continuously raising the bar for scalable, intelligent development


What You’ll Need


4+ years of experience as a full stack or backend engineer
Strong skills in Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB/MySQL
Experience building and deploying LLM-based applications using OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, etc
Comfort with AI workflows like prompt chaining, embeddings, RAG, or vector search
Familiarity with React/React Native to build intelligent frontends
Experience optimizing LLM inference or training pipelines for latency, throughput, or cost is a strong plus
Familiarity with infrastructure-as-code and cloud-native tooling (e.g. Docker, Terraform, AWS Lambda, CloudWatch, AWS CDK)
Proficient in batch processing tasks, system design, and test-driven development
Bonus: Exposure to Python for AI scripting or LangChain workflows
Bonus: Experience with Ruby, event-driven systems (RabbitMQ/SQS), or serverless AWS (CDK, Lambda)


Who Thrives Here


You have a deep curiosity about AI’s evolving landscape and enjoy staying on the frontier of tools and techniques
You mentor others and elevate your team through thoughtful feedback, shared learning, and technical clarity
You think AI is not a feature — it’s the foundation
You believe fast iteration beats perfection
You’re excited by 10x impact, not 10% improvements
You want to own outcomes, not just write code
You have a growth mindset and a builder’s DNA


AI Is the Driver — Let’s Build the Future Together

This is not AI as an afterthought. It’s the engine. We're not looking for someone to bolt AI onto existing systems — we're hiring engineers who want to rethink the entire system around intelligence.

If you want to be part of a fast-moving, high-performing team that's using AI to redefine what a fintech can be, apply now.

Benefits of working with us:


ALWAYS FULLY REMOTE WORK - Enjoy the flexibility of remote work, supported by necessary resources

About Us:

We help make it easy for Canadians to achieve financial freedom while making a positive impact.

We live in the most innovative and technologically advanced era, yet so much struggle exists. Most of us are far from where we want to be financially.

We all want a better future. A better world where reaching financial freedom is a question of when, not if. One that's equitable so that all can prosper. One that's safe from the impact of climate change.

Our money has the power to change the world. It’s up to us to do things differently.

Prepare scientific reports for internal and external stakeholders (e.g., customers, internal records, reporting grant agencies, government, etc.).
Support Technology leadership in the design and planning of experiments as required.
Train and supervise R&D co-op students and interns.
Actively participate in weekly R&D meetings.
Manage basic lab and equipment maintenance for seamless day-to-day activities.




About You:

There is no one-size-fits all when it comes to hiring great talent. First and foremost, we look for people who share our core values of integrity, collaboration, innovation and inclusion. Beyond that, we seek out talent that can positively contribute to our mission, our culture and our ambition to make a positive impact on our planet.

Bachelor’s or master’s degree in chemistry or chemical engineering. 
1-3 years of practical work experience in a wet chemistry lab environment. 
Experience in qualitative and quantitative analysis of contaminants in water (e.g., COD, TOC, TDS, TSS, pH, color, turbidity, conductivity).
Familiarity with the procedures in “Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater” is preferred.
Experience or knowledge of water treatment processes, especially on advanced oxidation processes, is an asset.
Deep passion for learning and continuous improvement.




Pay Range: $55,000 - $60,000 CAD
