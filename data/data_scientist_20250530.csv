Data Scientist

The Opportunity

As a data scientist, you’re excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set, and you’re fascinated by the possibilities presented by IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open new opportunities. As a data scientist at Booz Allen, you can help turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors—from fraud detection to cancer research to national intelligence—we need you to help find the answers in the data.

On our team, you’ll use your analytical skills and data science knowledge to create real-world impact. You’ll work closely with your clients to understand their questions and needs, and then dig into their data-rich environments to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll develop algorithms and systems and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn sets of disparate data points into objective answers to help clients make informed decisions. Ultimately, you’ll provide a deep understanding of the data, what it all means, and how it can be used.

Work with us as we use data science for good.

Join us. The world can’t wait.

2+ years of experience with data exploration, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, or data mining
2+ years of experience with statistical and general-purpose programming languages for data analysis
Experience with analyzing structured and unstructured data sources
Experience with briefing senior DoD leadership on technical deliveries
Experience in working independently, including with the entire analytics development process
Knowledge of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Natural Language Processing
Knowledge of Advana
TS/SCI clearance
Bachelor’s degree


Nice If You Have:  


2+ years of experience in the development of algorithms leveraging R, Python, or SQL and NoSQL
2+ years of experience with Distributed data or computing tools, including MapReduce, Hadoop, Hive, EMR, Kafka, Spark, Gurobi, or MySQL
Experience with Palantir Products

AudienceProject is looking for a Data Scientist for our Copenhagen office to support our continued growth.

—

Are you an analyst at heart? And do you have an interest in data modeling and programming? Then we have an opportunity for a career in a fast-growing scale-up that directly cooperates with companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, Netflix, Disney+ etc.




AudienceProject is a leading SaaS company with 100+ employees delivering audience measurement and research solutions to major advertisers, agencies, and publishers across Europe.




Our platform enables clients to better understand the reach and effect of their campaigns across channels, helping them make confident marketing decisions to reach and impact their audiences more effectively.




Embarking on our second decade of audience measurement, we are now looking for a motivated Data Scientist to join our Data Science Research team.

Joining AudienceProject will give you a front-row seat in the rapidly evolving marketing technology sector and an opportunity to work within a respected business, delivering insights about audiences across the world's largest media channels to top-tier clients and some of the world’s biggest brands.




What you will do

You will be tasked with developing and implementing new methodologies related to both our platform as well as work on bespoke solutions for top-tier clients.




In the Data Science Research team, you will work with nine other team members and have close collaboration with the developers in our Tech department. The team is small and dynamic, and there is plenty of room for innovation and good ideas are quickly turned into action.




You will use Databricks notebooks hosted on our cloud servers to interact with S3 for exploratory data analysis, visualizations and modeling. This is done in PySpark (or SparkR) since the vast amounts of data truly require distributed computing.




Essential qualifications

You have a Master's degree or higher education in a numerically oriented education (Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, etc.). Candidates with a social science background, specializing in statistics and data analysis, are also welcome to apply.
You have experience with data wrangling and analysis of large datasets and have developed a good intuition for how data can be used to create business insights.
You have a solid understanding of classical statistics techniques, including various regression analyses.
You have programming/scripting skills. Our current toolbox includes Python and R. It is an advantage to have good knowledge of at least one of these languages, as the position is primarily programming-oriented.
You are curious, structured, and goal-oriented. You enjoy diving into complex issues but understand that the goal is to find workable solutions.
You can communicate your results in a non-technical manner and understand how to make complex data analysis useful for non-data scientists.




Further qualifications

Experience working with simulations, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning models.
Experience with ""human-centered"" analysis and experience with analyzing attitudinal data, such as survey and/or online behavioral data.
An ability to understand the business implications of data and how to use it to build a strategic story that engages customers.




Relevant working experience is viewed as a plus but is not a strict requirement.




What we offer

A unique career opportunity in a fast-growing scale-up full of curious, intelligent and creative people where you can grow as we grow our company.

Competitive salary
Pension scheme and health insurance
Home internet paid
Central Copenhagen office
Hybrid work model
Daily breakfast
Lunch made by an on-site chef
Unlimited snacks, drinks and coffee
Friday bars and quarterly company dinners
International environment
Friendly, supportive and helpful colleagues
Innovative and market-leading products and services
Exposure to a lot of data handling
Technically/commercially challenging tasks
Working directly with some of the most modern and successful companies of our time
Mentorship from thought leaders in the industry




Send us your application

If you can see yourself in the above and want to work for a leading SaaS company, we want to hear from you.

If you have any questions about the position, please contact Jacob Daniel Kirstejn Hansen at jacobh@audienceproject.com.




We invite candidates for interviews on an ongoing basis, so please don’t hesitate to send your application. Apply via Linkedin attaching the following into one document:

Cover letter
Copy of (both) graduation certificates with grade transcripts




The deadline for applications is June 15th, 2025. We will be inviting applicants for interviews on an ongoing basis.

Data Scientist for Marketing at Saxo

Are you passionate about leveraging data to drive impactful marketing strategies? Saxo is on an exhilarating journey to become a data-driven organization, and we are seeking a dynamic Data Scientist to take the lead of the development of our predictive models focused on marketing. If you are eager to make a significant impact and grow with us, this is the perfect opportunity for you.  

Predictive Modelling and AI

Your role will involve building data pipelines using Airflow and Databricks, publishing data to Kafka and Data Lake, and deploying machine learning APIs to Kubernetes, primarily using Python.   Kindly note this position is in our Headquarters in Denmark.

Responsibilities

As our new Data Scientist, you will play a key role in shaping data-driven marketing strategies. You will evaluate marketing performance by combining Saxo’s internal data with third-party sources to assess return on marketing spend and uncover actionable insights. Further, you will take part in developing and refining our lead value score models—critical tools used by both Sales and Marketing to prioritize efforts and maximize business outcomes.

Below are other examples of what you can be responsible for: 


Assist in the development of marketing data foundation and establish data flows from marketing engines 
Develop an attribution model (MMM) for marketing and the rest of the organization to assist optimizing spend across markets and channels. 
Correlation and causality analysis on channels and campaigns.

Further: 


Proficient in Python or R
Relevant education or professional experience in Science, Technology, Economics, or Mathematics. 
Experience with time series analysis and state space modelling. 
Experience with Git. 
Ability to present data in an understandable way (knowledge of PowerBI or similar is a plus).

It’s an advantage if you’re already familiar with database systems - particularly if you’re efficient in SQL and have some exposure to tools like Azure Data Lake or Databricks Delta Lake. Similarly, experience with ETL tools such as Apache Airflow, Spark/Databricks, or Kafka is a plus.


That said, we know not everyone will tick every box. What matters most to us is your curiosity and eagerness to learn. If you bring the right mindset, we’re confident you’ll pick up these tools and technologies in no time.

As a future member of Saxo's Predictive Modelling and AI team, you'll have the opportunity to make a tangible impact by solving real-life marketing challenges through innovative data-driven strategies. Collaborating with diverse teams, you'll leverage cutting-edge technologies to develop predictive models that optimise marketing performance and drive meaningful business outcomes.
