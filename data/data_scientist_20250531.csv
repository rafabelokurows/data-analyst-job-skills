More than 40% of all fresh produce is wasted in the US, which accounts for over 17 billion dollars in lost product annually and contributes more carbon dioxide emissions than all of US transportation combined. Globally, food that is never consumed accounts for 7% of the global freshwater supply and 308MM hectares of land. Our goal is to reduce these drastic numbers by making the produce supply chain smarter through data-driven decisions.




Strella uses proprietary sensors to predict shelf life in the food supply chain. We use this information to reduce food waste and help deliver better quality produce to consumers. We have been commercialized for 5 years and are currently in our growth stage.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As an early member of our T&S Data Science and Analytics team, you will play an instrumental role in our company’s mission of building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence by building and scaling a data driven culture from the ground up. In this unique company, technology, and moment in history, your work will be critical to informing our product and commercial strategy as we deploy safe, frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with product, engineering, policy & enforcement to define and measure key company success metrics, analyze user behavior to identify new enforcement opportunities and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You’ve worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into user behavior data to provide insights on safety concerns
Define core metrics that measure the team's success. Set goals, build forecasts, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting
Identify and size opportunities to improve the product, influencing product roadmap through your insights and recommendations
Develop hypotheses on product changes, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics
Build a data driven culture from the ground up by establishing foundational data best practices and making data more accessible across the company


You May Be a Good Fit If You


8+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in an infrastructure or operations context.
5+ years of experience deeply embedding in Product teams
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI.
Expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective.
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress.
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions.
Experience in turning open questions and data into concise and insightful analysis.
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills.


Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$230,000 - $275,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Do you have a passion for deriving insights from data to make a difference in people's lives? Are you a Day 1 thinker who is passionate about pushing the boundaries of conventional talent development approaches and innovating on behalf of our customers? If so, we would like to hear from you!

PATOE is a centralized technology, data, reporting, and analytics organization that supports over a million employees globally, spanning support across NA Customer Fulfillment, Global Operations Learning & Development and PXT Capability & Impact, and Employee Relations.

We are seeking a DS who will lead new pioneering ideas from concept to reality and in this role—new bold ideas are always welcome. This DS will obsess over the Amazon employee experience and the employee voice across the organization. This DS will directly apply their knowledge to dig deep and help Amazon leaders gain actionable insights. Finding, prioritizing and resolving employee experience defects will be the mission every day. Thus, the challenge of this role is that it is never complete; we will always strive to push Amazon to be the Earth’s best employer.

The Data Scientist will play a critical role in advancing our mission. You will join a tight-knit team of PXT professionals, including HR, operational, program, product, tech and legal leaders. You will be supporting Amazon's World Wide Corporate, Consumer and Operations (WWCC & Ops) portfolio, and have direct impact on the daily work of over 1.3M+ Amazonians.

Our projects span multiple organizations and require coordination of experimentation, economic and causal analysis, forecasting, dashboarding and predictive machine learning tools. We’re looking for an enthusiastic technical expert and storyteller to explore the world of Amazon data to generate insights—connecting employee experiences to decision makers in a compelling way backed by data. Your focus will cover all aspects of how we learn more about our employees, uncover problems that need to be solved, and validate the impact of our solutions. You will work with other thinkers, creators, and communicators to build the skills of the entire team to create a research-driven organization. You will invent, refine solutions from start to finish—data sets, queries, models, reports, dashboards, analyses—to answer business questions while ensuring we are meeting the needs of the business and team goals. You will draw on your knowledge of data science best practices, big data management fundamentals, and analysis principles to build solutions that enable effective, data-driven business decisions. You will learn the business context and technologies behind your team’s data infrastructure and work with customers (e.g., researchers, economists, data engineers, business intelligence engineers, product managers) and other internal partners to ensure deliverables are aligned with expectations.

If you love getting to the “a-ha” moment, when the solution to a customer or employee problem reveals itself in the data— let’s talk!

Do you have a passion for deriving insights from data to make a difference in people's lives? Are you a Day 1 thinker who is passionate about pushing the boundaries of conventional talent development approaches and innovating on behalf of our customers? If so, we would like to hear from you!

PATOE is a centralized technology, data, reporting, and analytics organization that supports over a million employees globally, spanning support across NA Customer Fulfillment, Global Operations Learning & Development and PXT Capability & Impact, and Employee Relations.

We are seeking a DS who will lead new pioneering ideas from concept to reality and in this role—new bold ideas are always welcome. This DS will obsess over the Amazon employee experience and the employee voice across the organization. This DS will directly apply their knowledge to dig deep and help Amazon leaders gain actionable insights. Finding, prioritizing and resolving employee experience defects will be the mission every day. Thus, the challenge of this role is that it is never complete; we will always strive to push Amazon to be the Earth’s best employer.

The Data Scientist will play a critical role in advancing our mission. You will join a tight-knit team of PXT professionals, including HR, operational, program, product, tech and legal leaders. You will be supporting Amazon's World Wide Corporate, Consumer and Operations (WWCC & Ops) portfolio, and have direct impact on the daily work of over 1.3M+ Amazonians.

Our projects span multiple organizations and require coordination of experimentation, economic and causal analysis, forecasting, dashboarding and predictive machine learning tools. We’re looking for an enthusiastic technical expert and storyteller to explore the world of Amazon data to generate insights—connecting employee experiences to decision makers in a compelling way backed by data. Your focus will cover all aspects of how we learn more about our employees, uncover problems that need to be solved, and validate the impact of our solutions. You will work with other thinkers, creators, and communicators to build the skills of the entire team to create a research-driven organization. You will invent, refine solutions from start to finish—data sets, queries, models, reports, dashboards, analyses—to answer business questions while ensuring we are meeting the needs of the business and team goals. You will draw on your knowledge of data science best practices, big data management fundamentals, and analysis principles to build solutions that enable effective, data-driven business decisions. You will learn the business context and technologies behind your team’s data infrastructure and work with customers (e.g., researchers, economists, data engineers, business intelligence engineers, product managers) and other internal partners to ensure deliverables are aligned with expectations.

If you love getting to the “a-ha” moment, when the solution to a customer or employee problem reveals itself in the data— let’s talk!

Lazarus Naturals was founded in 2016 to provide safe and accessible CBD products for everyone who would benefit from them, regardless of their financial situation and ability to pay, which is why we provide a 60% Assistance Program to veterans and people with disabilities or low-incomes. In order to maintain an affordable price point and our commitment to accessibility for all, we have built a vertically integrated business model, which allows us to walk our talk of developing quality, affordable products - from product inception, development, seed, farming, extraction, finished production formulation and packaging, and distribution.

Cycling Frog is normalizing the consumption of casual use THC products. We are on a mission to make THC convenient, affordable, and fun by making a sessionable THC beverage the same price as a beer or soda. We want to change the way THC is consumed and viewed by our society by focusing on lower potency, ready to drink beverages that can easily fit into anyone's lifestyle. Under the Federal Farm Bill it is legal to sell these low potency THC products across all 50 states via the internet, and anywhere you can grab a beer.

This role will be based in Seattle, WA.

Summary: This JD pertains to an R&D Scientist with a background in product and process development to support our Seattle office. The candidate should have a strong grounding in scientific principles, and a demonstrated track record of developing products and processes from proof of concept through scale up, validation, and implementation. Beyond technical qualifications and sufficient experience requirements, we at Etz Hayim look for people who can thrive in our work environment and actively challenge themselves. We prioritize applicants who can illustrate their capacity to think critically, approach problem solving positively and constructively, as well as the ability to claim responsibility for their actions, whether good or bad. It is equally important that any applicant is able to exhibit an appreciation for proactive honesty and marked flexibility in the face of abrupt change. Moreover, we prefer applicants who share our passion and pride in the work we all contribute to as a team.
