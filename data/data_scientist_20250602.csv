Assessment de compliance con estándares de Banco Sabadell y los requerimientos regulatorios.
Documentación modelos y estimaciones para uso en Banco Sabadell.




Darás soporte en auditorías y validaciones tanto internas como externas (supervisor, auditores externos).




Harás mantenimiento y desarrollo de las BBDD:




Controles de calidad de datos y conocimiento del proceso.
Planteo de requerimientos a IT y validación de la implementación de los mismos.




¿Qué valoramos de tu candidatura?




Que tengas estudios superiores en Economía, Estadística, Matemáticas, Actuariales, Física o Ingeniería Superior.




Valoraremos formación complementaria (Master o Postgrado) con componente cuantitativo y/o acreditaciones como FRM, CQF, Certificaciones en Data Analytics, Modelling, Machine Learning o similar.




Experiencia mínima de 2-3 años en funciones vinculadas a modelos de riesgo de crédito (desarrollo, control, seguimiento, coordinación, validación, auditoría), en sector Banca.
