40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 118 million registered users and 243,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 443+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.198.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Scientist to join our newly established Demand and Marketing Analytics team. In this role, you will play a pivotal role in enhancing marketing effectiveness through advanced analytics and supporting demand forecasting initiatives, ensuring our marketing strategies are data-driven and impactful.

As a Marketplace, Marketing is one of Too Good To Go’s most powerful levers for driving demand. Consequently, a strong foundation in marketing metrics is essential for this role. The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, your role may extend beyond marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Your role


Support business leaders in identifying and defining key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive marketing and business performance.
Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders to inform strategic marketing decisions.
Design and develop self-service analytical tools to empower marketing and other functional teams for operational excellence.
Create and implement statistical and machine learning models to evaluate marketing effectiveness and optimize campaign strategies.
Collaborate with marketing teams to understand their needs and translate them into effective models and tools.
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify drivers of demand and quantify the impact of marketing initiatives.
Create advanced analytical tools and models to enhance demand forecasting accuracy.
Contribute to broader data-driven projects, leveraging advanced analytics to support company-wide objectives.


Requirements


You have a minimum Master in econometrics, statistics, data science, or similar.
Previous professional experience in data science, with a strong focus on statistical modeling and machine learning.
Expertise in developing advanced models and analytical tools for time series forecasting and demand forecasting.
Familiarity with marketing mix modeling is a plus.
Understanding of marketing data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation, and Python for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and model development; R is a plus.
Hands-on experience collaborating with marketing teams, ideally in dynamic settings like hackathons, to deliver data-driven insights.
Great communicator and storyteller, adept at helping non-technical marketing audiences understand data insights.
Passionate about advancing analytical skills and fostering a data-driven culture.
Fluent in English, with excellent written and verbal communication skills.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer


An opportunity to work in a global social-impact company and certified B Corporation! where you can see a real and tangible impact in your role.
To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.
Work-life balance is important to us! Focus on the job to be done, not the hours spent, there is no need for overtime.
We trust in our employees and encourage an autonomous environment that provides several opportunities for employees to contribute, develop and take ownership of their work in a way that works for them.
To be part of an international company, with over 1,300+ colleagues across 19 countries that are on the same important mission.

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.




Vertex Search is acting as a recruitment agency on this assignment.

We believe that everyone can have equal and unconstrained access to educational experiences on par with Oxford, Cambridge, CalTech, et cetera. We believe that this can be achieved with a new class of learning tools, which combine advances in cognitive science, language models, and datasets. We are building these tools in England.

Our first product, Grasp Concepts, enables students to disambiguate and learn concepts through great online explanations and is deployed with design partners including Imperial College London. Our second product, Grasp Pathways, decomposes learning goals and suggests flexible learning trajectories to reach them, using reputable learning resources like books and lectures, and is in private alpha. An on-demand, online oxbridge-like experience.

Team and Funding

We've raised significant capital from top tier investors including Balderton Capital, Mozilla (yes, Firefox), and Point9. Our founder Ed built the Payments and Trading products at Revolut alongside his bachelors and masters degrees. He was also one of a handful of investors at DST Global. Our team have backgrounds in elite institutions including Revolut, Huawei, Max-Planck Institute, Oxford, and Cambridge. We're building something so hard we cannot afford to work with anyone but the best.

The Barts Health group of NHS hospitals is entering an exciting new era on our improvement journey to becoming an outstanding organisation with a world-class clinical reputation. Having lifted ourselves out of special measures, we now have the impetus and breathing space to chart a fresh course in which we are continually striving to improve all our services for patients.

Our vision is to be a high-performing group of NHS hospitals, renowned for excellence and innovation, and providing safe and compassionate care to our patients in east London and beyond. That means being a provider of excellent patient safety, known for delivering consistently high standards of harm-free care and always caring for patients in the right place at the right time. It also means being an outstanding place to work, in which our WeCare values and behaviours are visible to all and guide us in how we work together.

We strive to live by our WeCare values and are committed to promoting inclusion, where every staff member has a sense of belonging. We value our differences and fully advocate, cultivate and support an inclusive working environment.

We particularly welcome applications from Black, Asian and minority ethnic candidates as they are underrepresented within Barts Health at this band

With big investment and tie-ins secured, a large valuation already and top talent on board, this is one not to be missed!

You’ll build the ML tools and infrastructure that allow researchers, scientists and pharma clients to deploy and scale foundation models / large medicine models effectively — no SaaS platform, just highly tailored solutions with real-world impact.




What You’ll Do

Work as part of a high performing team of academic, AI and technology specialists to integrate and scale ML models in hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS cloud).
Own and improve ML infrastructure: model deployment, training pipelines, inference tooling.
Diagnose and optimise performance of large-scale ML models.
Build and maintain experiment tracking, monitoring, and observability systems.
Collaborate with SWE and infra colleagues to build tooling for data access, cleaning, and delivery.
Contribute to the internal “toolbox” enabling repeatable, scalable ML deployment across client teams.
Work closely with researchers and strategy teams to bridge cutting-edge models with real-world use.




Successful candidates will likely have a subset of the following:

Strong academic background in Mathematics, Computer Science, or related field.
Experience deploying ML models at scale in real-world, high-performance environments.
Fluency in PyTorch (or similar) environments, with experience in multi-node training and scale-up workflows.
Deep understanding of ML Ops best practices: experiment tracking, data/version control, reproducibility.
Ability to diagnose and tune model performance (both training and inference).
Comfort navigating hybrid infrastructure: some workloads will be on-prem, others cloud (large GPU clusters).
Familiarity with distributed systems and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Ray).
Experience working client-facing or in cross-functional teams — ideally within pharma/life sciences.1
A “get stuck in” attitude — this is a team of doers, not just architects.




Bonus Points For

Familiarity with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NSight, Triton Inference Server) is a major plus.
Multi-modal model experience.
3d imaging experience.
Interest in or exposure to pharma and computational biology use cases.
Experience in fast-paced environments (e.g., startups, hedge funds, advanced R&D orgs).




The Team

You’ll join a growing, technical-first team with SWE and infra colleagues lined up, and work alongside researchers and strategists to support 4–5 high-value clients at a time.




The firm offers competitive salaries plus stock options and bonus schemes, and aims to provide a meritocratic environment where performance is rewarded in a big way.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$142,400 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.
