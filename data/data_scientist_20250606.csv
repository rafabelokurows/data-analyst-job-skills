AudienceProject is looking for a Data Scientist for our Copenhagen office to support our continued growth.

‚Äî

Are you an analyst at heart? And do you have an interest in data modeling and programming? Then we have an opportunity for a career in a fast-growing scale-up that directly cooperates with companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, Netflix, Disney+ etc.




AudienceProject is a leading SaaS company with 100+ employees delivering audience measurement and research solutions to major advertisers, agencies, and publishers across Europe.




Our platform enables clients to better understand the reach and effect of their campaigns across channels, helping them make confident marketing decisions to reach and impact their audiences more effectively.




Embarking on our second decade of audience measurement, we are now looking for a motivated Data Scientist to join our Data Science Research team.

Joining AudienceProject will give you a front-row seat in the rapidly evolving marketing technology sector and an opportunity to work within a respected business, delivering insights about audiences across the world's largest media channels to top-tier clients and some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands.




What you will do

You will be tasked with developing and implementing new methodologies related to both our platform as well as work on bespoke solutions for top-tier clients.




In the Data Science Research team, you will work with nine other team members and have close collaboration with the developers in our Tech department. The team is small and dynamic, and there is plenty of room for innovation and good ideas are quickly turned into action.




You will use Databricks notebooks hosted on our cloud servers to interact with S3 for exploratory data analysis, visualizations and modeling. This is done in PySpark (or SparkR) since the vast amounts of data truly require distributed computing.




Essential qualifications

You have a Master's degree or higher education in a numerically oriented education (Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, etc.). Candidates with a social science background, specializing in statistics and data analysis, are also welcome to apply.
You have experience with data wrangling and analysis of large datasets and have developed a good intuition for how data can be used to create business insights.
You have a solid understanding of classical statistics techniques, including various regression analyses.
You have programming/scripting skills. Our current toolbox includes Python and R. It is an advantage to have good knowledge of at least one of these languages, as the position is primarily programming-oriented.
You are curious, structured, and goal-oriented. You enjoy diving into complex issues but understand that the goal is to find workable solutions.
You can communicate your results in a non-technical manner and understand how to make complex data analysis useful for non-data scientists.




Further qualifications

Experience working with simulations, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning models.
Experience with ""human-centered"" analysis and experience with analyzing attitudinal data, such as survey and/or online behavioral data.
An ability to understand the business implications of data and how to use it to build a strategic story that engages customers.




Relevant working experience is viewed as a plus but is not a strict requirement.




What we offer

A unique career opportunity in a fast-growing scale-up full of curious, intelligent and creative people where you can grow as we grow our company.

Competitive salary
Pension scheme and health insurance
Home internet paid
Central Copenhagen office
Hybrid work model
Daily breakfast
Lunch made by an on-site chef
Unlimited snacks, drinks and coffee
Friday bars and quarterly company dinners
International environment
Friendly, supportive and helpful colleagues
Innovative and market-leading products and services
Exposure to a lot of data handling

Working directly with some of the most modern and successful companies of our time
Mentorship from thought leaders in the industry

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We‚Äôre more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We‚Äôre growing fast: Our community of 118 million registered users and 243,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 443+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.198.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Scientist to join our newly established Demand and Marketing Analytics team. In this role, you will play a pivotal role in enhancing marketing effectiveness through advanced analytics and supporting demand forecasting initiatives, ensuring our marketing strategies are data-driven and impactful.

As a Marketplace, Marketing is one of Too Good To Go‚Äôs most powerful levers for driving demand. Consequently, a strong foundation in marketing metrics is essential for this role. The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, your role may extend beyond marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you‚Äôre passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we‚Äôd love to hear from you.

Your role


Support business leaders in identifying and defining key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive marketing and business performance.
Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders to inform strategic marketing decisions.
Design and develop self-service analytical tools to empower marketing and other functional teams for operational excellence.
Create and implement statistical and machine learning models to evaluate marketing effectiveness and optimize campaign strategies.
Collaborate with marketing teams to understand their needs and translate them into effective models and tools.
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify drivers of demand and quantify the impact of marketing initiatives.
Create advanced analytical tools and models to enhance demand forecasting accuracy.
Contribute to broader data-driven projects, leveraging advanced analytics to support company-wide objectives.


Requirements


You have a minimum Master in econometrics, statistics, data science, or similar.
Previous professional experience in data science, with a strong focus on statistical modeling and machine learning.
Expertise in developing advanced models and analytical tools for time series forecasting and demand forecasting.
Familiarity with marketing mix modeling is a plus.
Understanding of marketing data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation, and Python for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and model development; R is a plus.
Hands-on experience collaborating with marketing teams, ideally in dynamic settings like hackathons, to deliver data-driven insights.
Great communicator and storyteller, adept at helping non-technical marketing audiences understand data insights.
Passionate about advancing analytical skills and fostering a data-driven culture.
Fluent in English, with excellent written and verbal communication skills.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We‚Äôre proud of the change we‚Äôre driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer


An opportunity to work in a global social-impact company and certified B Corporation! where you can see a real and tangible impact in your role.
To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.
Work-life balance is important to us! Focus on the job to be done, not the hours spent, there is no need for overtime.
We trust in our employees and encourage an autonomous environment that provides several opportunities for employees to contribute, develop and take ownership of their work in a way that works for them.
To be part of an international company, with over 1,300+ colleagues across 19 countries that are on the same important mission.
An informal environment, working alongside 170+ passionate people within Tech & Product
