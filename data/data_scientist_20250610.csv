Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Job Summary

We are seeking a highly motivated AI / ML / LLM Engineer to join our core technology team in Canada. The ideal candidate will have hands-on experience with training, fine-tuning, and deploying machine learning and large language models (LLMs) in real-world healthcare and embedded applications. This role involves working with multimodal data (text, image, time-series), optimizing models for edge deployment (e.g., on Jetson platforms), and collaborating with clinical and engineering teams to develop intelligent decision-support tools.

Key Responsibilities


Model Development & Training: Design and implement ML models and LLMs for clinical NLP, computer vision, and time-series analysis.
LLM Fine-Tuning & Optimization: Fine-tune transformer-based LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, GPT, BERT) using domain-specific data.
Multimodal Integration: Fuse data from EMR notes, physiological monitors, and video sources to build robust predictive systems.
Edge AI Inference: Optimize and deploy ML/LLM models on edge platforms such as NVIDIA Jetson (Xavier, AGX Orin).
Pipeline Automation: Build scalable training and inference pipelines using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers.
Evaluation & Validation: Define performance metrics, conduct clinical validations, and refine models for safety-critical environments.
Collaboration & Documentation: Work with firmware, frontend, and clinical teams; maintain technical documentation and research records.


Required Qualifications


3+ years of experience in AI/ML development, including work on NLP and LLMs
Proficiency in Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
Hands-on experience with Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, or OpenLLM frameworks
Familiarity with NVIDIA CUDA, TensorRT, and ONNX for edge model acceleration
Strong understanding of neural networks, model interpretability, and training workflows
Experience with Git, version control, and collaborative development practices
Solid grasp of medical or clinical datasets (notes, time-series, imaging) preferred


Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models on Jetson platforms (Nano, TX2, Xavier, Orin)
Understanding of HIPAA, PHI, and secure model deployment in healthcare
Knowledge of classical ML algorithms (XGBoost, SVM, clustering) for tabular data
Experience with multimodal model architectures (e.g., vision-language models)
Publications or participation in medical AI challenges (e.g., PhysioNet, MIMIC)


Why Join Us?


Develop impactful AI solutions for neonatal and critical care
Work at the intersection of healthcare, deep learning, and edge computing
Collaborate with top clinicians, engineers, and researchers
Competitive salary, benefits, and the opportunity to shape next-gen AI products
