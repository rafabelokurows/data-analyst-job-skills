AudienceProject is looking for a Data Scientist for our Copenhagen office to support our continued growth.

—

Are you an analyst at heart? And do you have an interest in data modeling and programming? Then we have an opportunity for a career in a fast-growing scale-up that directly cooperates with companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, Netflix, Disney+ etc.




AudienceProject is a leading SaaS company with 100+ employees delivering audience measurement and research solutions to major advertisers, agencies, and publishers across Europe.




Our platform enables clients to better understand the reach and effect of their campaigns across channels, helping them make confident marketing decisions to reach and impact their audiences more effectively.




Embarking on our second decade of audience measurement, we are now looking for a motivated Data Scientist to join our Data Science Research team.

Joining AudienceProject will give you a front-row seat in the rapidly evolving marketing technology sector and an opportunity to work within a respected business, delivering insights about audiences across the world's largest media channels to top-tier clients and some of the world’s biggest brands.




What you will do

You will be tasked with developing and implementing new methodologies related to both our platform as well as work on bespoke solutions for top-tier clients.




In the Data Science Research team, you will work with nine other team members and have close collaboration with the developers in our Tech department. The team is small and dynamic, and there is plenty of room for innovation and good ideas are quickly turned into action.




You will use Databricks notebooks hosted on our cloud servers to interact with S3 for exploratory data analysis, visualizations and modeling. This is done in PySpark (or SparkR) since the vast amounts of data truly require distributed computing.




Essential qualifications

You have a Master's degree or higher education in a numerically oriented education (Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, etc.). Candidates with a social science background, specializing in statistics and data analysis, are also welcome to apply.
You have experience with data wrangling and analysis of large datasets and have developed a good intuition for how data can be used to create business insights.
You have a solid understanding of classical statistics techniques, including various regression analyses.
You have programming/scripting skills. Our current toolbox includes Python and R. It is an advantage to have good knowledge of at least one of these languages, as the position is primarily programming-oriented.
You are curious, structured, and goal-oriented. You enjoy diving into complex issues but understand that the goal is to find workable solutions.
You can communicate your results in a non-technical manner and understand how to make complex data analysis useful for non-data scientists.




Further qualifications

Experience working with simulations, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning models.
Experience with ""human-centered"" analysis and experience with analyzing attitudinal data, such as survey and/or online behavioral data.
An ability to understand the business implications of data and how to use it to build a strategic story that engages customers.




Relevant working experience is viewed as a plus but is not a strict requirement.




What we offer

A unique career opportunity in a fast-growing scale-up full of curious, intelligent and creative people where you can grow as we grow our company.

Competitive salary
Pension scheme and health insurance
Home internet paid
Central Copenhagen office
Hybrid work model
Daily breakfast
Lunch made by an on-site chef
Unlimited snacks, drinks and coffee
Friday bars and quarterly company dinners
International environment
Friendly, supportive and helpful colleagues
Innovative and market-leading products and services
Exposure to a lot of data handling
Technically/commercially challenging tasks
Working directly with some of the most modern and successful companies of our time
Mentorship from thought leaders in the industry




Send us your application

If you can see yourself in the above and want to work for a leading SaaS company, we want to hear from you.

What’s more meaningful than seeing the real-world impact of your work?




Ok, maybe ending world hunger, but this is a strong second.

At OOONO, you’re not just building models in a notebook. You’re shaping the algorithms that directly power a physical product - used in real time by real people in the real world.

Join a small, collaborative team where you’re trusted to take ownership, test bold ideas, and push things into production. You’ll work hands-on with rich geospatial data to make our location logic smarter and faster.

And you’ll do it side by side with engineers, hardware specialists, and designers who genuinely care - about the product, the users, and each other.

What you’ll be doing

Develop and improve core algorithms to enhance product performance and user experience.
Contribute to map matching logic and road network analysis to improve location accuracy
Design, build, and maintain predictive models to solve complex business challenges.
Analyze large-scale data sets from Athena, MongoDB, and other sources to extract actionable insights.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Software, Hardware, UX/UI) to implement data-driven solutions.
Experiment with cutting-edge geospatial tools and frameworks to continuously improve analytical workflows.
Handle location data and geo spatial field.




We imagine you’re someone who has

A master’s degree in data science, geoinformatics or similar field
Proven experience (3+ years) in a Data Science role or similar, ideally within a tech environment and working with geospatial data
Proficiency in Python, including libraries such as Polars, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, Pyproj, Folium, Osmnx
Knowledge of geospatial analysis techniques (e.g., spatial joins, indexing, projections).
Strong understanding of statistical analysis, machine learning, and algorithm development.
Solid problem-solving skills and ability to work independently when needed
Hands-on person that can drive processes from A to B independently
English is a requirement.
Self-driven




How is it working at OOONO?

We’re glad we asked. It’s a nice working place. As in nice-nice. We have a relaxed, informal atmosphere and a flat hierarchy. Whenever you need a break from your important work stuff, you can get beat in table tennis, foosball, or just smalltalk about the weather by the coffee machine. We have monthly social events where we do anything from go-karting to going to festivals.

And when we’re not social? Then we’re pretty damn ambitious. We don’t like conservative targets or linear growth. We’re all about the extraordinary. This has led OOONO to become one of the fastest-growing tech scaleups and surprise-surprise: We have no plans of slowing down. So yes, OOONO is a lovely place to work, but it’s also a pretty good opportunity to develop as a person and take the next steps in your career.




The practical stuff

Start date: ASAP
Send your motivated CV to job@ooono.dk
Working hours: Full-time (37 hours)
Location: Gearhalsvej 1.1, 2500 Valby
