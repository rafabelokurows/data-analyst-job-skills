Job Description

What is the opportunity?

As a Data Scientist, you will analyze, design, and implement data science solutions in the RBC Chief Audit Executive (CAE) Group. Data Science allows us to better understand the implications of what information means, identify trends, anticipate future behaviors, perform pattern matching that leads to a future decision and predict the outcomes of future events and violations. Our group specializes in taking full advantage of large data sets to explore and discover new insights that would have not been possible with traditional analytics. Leveraging leading edge technologies and capabilities, we apply machine learning and statistical modelling techniques to help auditors understand the changing risk environment, while building tools to bring this information to their fingertips.

What will you do?


Work closely with stakeholders to understand their needs and build solutions using advanced machine learning methods and Generative AI in the domain of risk and compliance.
Design and implement end-to-end data pipelines: from data cleaning to model development to writing production level code.
Implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, data mining methods, statistical analysis, and pipelines to prepare and integrate various data types and sources.
Quickly learn new methods, tools and technologies presented in research communities to implement and adapt within our ecosystem and models.
Collaborate proactively with various business and operation units to design innovative solutions to optimize processes and deploy production-scale solutions.
Work on challenging and research-based initiatives using advanced machine learning methods focusing on tangible outcomes.
Prototype and build Generative AI tools to augment our internal processes and drive efficiencies.


What do you need to succeed?

Must Have


At least an undergraduate degree (PhD. or Masters preferred) in a quantitative field (Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics, Sociology, Psychology etc.).

mytorso.ai is an ambitious early-stage digital health startup based in the vibrant tech hub of Vancouver, BC. We are on a mission to empower individuals to optimize their resilience and overall wellness by delivering holistic, data-driven insights that connect breath form, core stability, and nervous system regulation. We achieve this by combining our proprietary wearable technology with industry-leading wellness wearables, health apps, and cutting-edge AI, we offer data-driven feedback and highly personalized plans that help users thrive.




We are passionate about harnessing technology to unlock new potentials in human wellness. If you're looking to join a company that's making a real difference in people's lives and want to gain hands-on startup experience from experienced innovators, we encourage you to apply!




Position Overview

mytorso.ai seeks a talented, motivated Intermediate Data Scientist enthusiastic about leveraging Generative AI to accelerate development and unlock new possibilities in health data analysis. You will be pivotal in developing our platform's core intelligence, starting with an initial area of focus on transforming raw sensor data from our wearable into meaningful, breath form classifications and personalized breath signatures.

Subsequently, your expertise will be crucial for creating a holistic wellness platform. This will involve integrating data from various wearables and health apps, and developing an AI Agent with conversational capabilities to enable intuitive, user-led exploration of aggregated health data.

This is a unique chance to contribute to foundational areas of development, build core technology, and grow your skills in a dynamic, supportive environment.




What You'll Do:

End-to-End Model Development: Design, develop, train, validate, and deploy robust machine learning models for time-series classification, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition, specifically tailored to physiological sensor data (e.g., breath mechanics, core stability signals).
Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering: Develop and refine data preprocessing pipelines for ingesting, cleaning, and preparing large volumes of proprietary and third-party sensor data. Engineer and select impactful features from raw data streams to optimize model performance and extract meaningful physiological insights.
Holistic Platform Development: Contribute to the design of data aggregation and normalization strategies for the holistic Wellness platform, integrating data from diverse commercial wearables and health applications.
AI Agent & Conversational Interface Development: Design, develop, and refine components of an AI Agent, including its conversational interface (leveraging NLP and dialogue management), to enable intuitive, user-led exploration and understanding of aggregated health data.
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with engineering, product, and health science teams to define data requirements, translate complex problems into data science solutions, and integrate models into our platform.
Insight Generation & Communication: Analyze data to uncover actionable insights and trends. Clearly document methodologies, experiments, and results, and effectively present findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Continuous Learning & Innovation: Stay current with the latest advancements in data science, machine learning, signal processing, wearable technology, AI agents, and GenAI, particularly within the digital health domain, and proactively identify opportunities for innovation.




Who You Are:

Education & Experience: Master’s or Ph.D. in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering with 3+ years of demonstrable hands-on experience in data science or machine learning roles, including a proven record of developing and deploying ML/AI models.
Python & Data Science Ecosystem: Strong proficiency in Python and its core data science libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Machine Learning Expertise: Solid experience with a range of machine learning algorithms (especially for time-series analysis, classification, and signal processing), robust feature engineering techniques, and comprehensive model evaluation methodologies.
AI Agent / Conversational AI Knowledge: Experience or strong foundational knowledge in developing AI agents, conversational AI systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and dialogue management.
Cloud Experience: Proficiency in developing and deploying ML/AI on cloud computing platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) and MLOps principles.
Data Handling & Pipelines: Proven experience in developing data preprocessing pipelines and working with complex, potentially noisy, sensor data.
Generative AI Acumen: Demonstrated interest and practical experience of leveraging GenAI tools to enhance data science workflows.
Analytical & Problem-Solving Prowess: A strong analytical mindset with the ability to tackle complex, ill-defined problems, critically evaluate data, and derive actionable insights.
Communication & Collaboration: Excellent verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to articulate complex technical concepts clearly and concisely to diverse audiences. A collaborative team player who thrives in an agile startup environment.
Adaptability & Initiative: A proactive learner who quickly adapts to new technologies and methodologies, and takes initiative to drive projects forward.




Desirable Skills (Nice-to-Haves):

Experience working directly with physiological sensor data (e.g., ECG, PPG, EMG, accelerometer, gyroscope).
Previous experience in the digital health, wellness, or health tech industry.
