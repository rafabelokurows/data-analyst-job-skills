Job Description

We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join the Logistics Optimization team on our journey to always deliver amazing experiences.

The Optimization Tribe's purpose is to maximize Delivery Hero's logistics performance. We achieve this by owning and continuously improving the sophisticated algorithm that solves the real-time vehicle routing problem, assigning orders efficiently every minute. This directly impacts DH's core efficiency and customer satisfaction KPIs, influencing decisions for stakeholders from Operations to Product.

As a Data Scientist, your value lies in tackling these fascinating problems head-on and building ML products which shape the algorithm's logic and decisions to meet our long-term goals of best-in-class efficiency and service, making a tangible impact across the Delivery Hero network.


Lead the conceptualization and design of advanced modeling solutions (ML, Statistics or Mathematical) to tackle complex, large-scale Logistics challenges, ensuring alignment with business value and stakeholder needs.
Take ownership of developing, implementing, and automating robust data science models and pipelines, including feature generation, retraining, and prediction deployment, leveraging tools like BigQuery and Spark as needed.
Actively drive technical discussions and problem-solving sessions, contributing significant expertise and innovative ideas to overcome the toughest modeling hurdles alongside your Data Science peers and squad lead.
Translate sophisticated analytical findings and model outcomes into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders, demonstrably driving value and improvements in key business metrics.
Proactively engage with Data & ML Engineering and Tech teams to define critical data requirements and influence technical roadmaps, ensuring the necessary data infrastructure for impactful projects.
Make a significant impact within our fast-paced, global organization by delivering high-quality solutions, sharing knowledge, and contributing to the team's overall growth and best practices.


Qualifications


You have significant experience (ideally 5+ years) designing and implementing diverse machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification, tree-based ensembles) to solve real-world business problems, backed by a strong theoretical foundation in statistics and probability.
You possess expert-level Python skills (incl. pandas, scikit-learn, etc.), proficiency in SQL, and demonstrable experience building robust, maintainable, and automated ML pipelines using Big Data technologies (e.g., BigQuery, Spark) and workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Metaflow), applying software engineering best practices.
You excel at translating ambiguous business requirements into well-defined technical problems and data science solutions, critically evaluating assumptions and ensuring data quality throughout the process.
You are a strong communicator, capable of clearly explaining complex technical concepts, model intuition, and business implications to diverse audiences (both technical and non-technical stakeholders).
You are a proactive team player with proven experience collaborating effectively with peers and cross-functional teams (like Data Engineering and Tech) in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. Fluency in English is required.


Nice to have:


Deeper experience applying Operations Research techniques to solve optimization problems relevant to logistics.
Proven track record in designing, implementing, and analyzing complex experiments (beyond standard A/B tests) or applying causal inference methods.
Experience building interactive data visualizations, applications, or dashboards using libraries like Streamlit, Plotly Dash, or similar tools to communicate results effectively.

At Gemma, we help our clients activate data by using state-of-the-art technology. Our clients make better choices and are empowered to make use of their data on their own. We are service-focused, yet also build open-source tools to deliver a more effective and efficient service. You can read more about our data philosophy here.

Our clients range from Series A ventures to SMEs with 30 to 13,000 employees per client. We have an honest, pleasant, and fun work environment. Please make reference calls on us for validation :)

About The Job

Gemma Analytics helps startups and SMEs become truly data-driven.

As one of our (Junior) Analytics Engineers, you’ll play a key role in helping our clients turn raw data into meaningful business insights. Your superpower is not just understanding data – it's asking the right questions, seeing patterns others miss, and helping teams make smart, informed decisions.

You’ll work closely with clients to understand their business needs, uncover data opportunities, and build the foundations for robust, scalable analytics. In your first months, you'll be supported by experienced mentors to help you grow confidently into your role.

This role is ideal for someone with a strong business foundation who’s excited to dive deeper into the world of data.

Responsibilities


Collaborate closely with domain experts and business stakeholders to translate needs into data solutions
Develop clean, understandable data models and pipelines (we’re tooling-agnostic, so you’ll learn a lot!)
Build intuitive reports and dashboards that help clients track what matters
Explore and validate new tools and approaches in the modern data stack
Learn and grow alongside a supportive team of data & analytics engineers, data analysts and data consultants


Who You Are

We’re looking for someone with strong business acumen, analytical thinking, and a hunger to learn. You may have started your career in a business domain and are now eager to combine that experience with data to make an even bigger impact. You bring:


A degree in Business, Economics, or a related field — or hands-on business experience in a commercial, marketing, product, or operations role
OR a recent MBA or other advanced business training
First experience with SQL and relational databases
A curious, open mindset and the ability to think in both numbers and narratives


Bonus If You Also Have


Experience with a programming language (e.g. Python)
Familiarity with BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker
Experience managing stakeholders or cross-functional collaboration
A basic understanding of data modeling techniques (e.g. Kimball or Data Vault)
Business fluency in German and English (C1 or native level in both)
We welcome applications from all backgrounds — especially those underrepresented in tech and data. If you’re unsure whether you meet every single requirement, we still encourage you to apply. We’re looking for potential, not perfection.


Gemma Perks

We are located in Berlin, close to Nordbahnhof. We are currently 20 colleagues and will grow to 22 colleagues until the end of the year. Other perks include


We have an honest, inclusive work environment and want to nurture this environment
We have frequent team events in Berlin: our cultural base
We encourage workcations and even do workcations as a company - it is up to you to come to the office between two and five days a week
We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective
We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles
We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input
We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open for further initiatives
We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees
We are fast-growing, have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably
We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, having a good time, and of course, solving complex data-related tasks solving complex data-related tasks

They're building intelligent systems that do more than just automate — they understand, adapt, and learn in real time. And now they’re looking for a Data Scientist to shape the next phase of their AI-driven product evolution.




As a core member of the Data Science team, you won’t just be running models — you’ll be designing end-to-end data workflows, building and evaluating state-of-the-art AI systems, and working alongside engineers and product teams to translate insights into real-world impact. This is your opportunity to work on bleeding-edge ML with purpose — in an environment where experimentation and bold ideas are part of the DNA.




What you’ll be working with:

A modern data stack: Python, SQL, and TypeScript (for integration)
Leading ML/AI frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, HuggingFace
Scalable infrastructure: GCP, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Firestore, AlloyDB
Productionizing ML: from fine-tuning foundation models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.) to optimizing deployment pipelines
Cross-functional collaboration with engineers, designers, and domain experts to shape smart, adaptive AI products




What they’re looking for:

Strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and modern data science libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
Hands-on experience with ML model development and deployment (bonus: exposure to LLMs and generative AI)
A solid grasp of data architecture, experimentation, and performance evaluation
A collaborative mindset with a track record of working across disciplines to solve complex problems
Experience in startup or fast-paced environments is a plus




Why this role?

Autonomy & Ownership: You’ll shape how data science is done — from tools to strategy
Impact: Your models and insights will directly influence core product experiences
Real-world AI: Build systems that are used, not just published
Growth: Join at an early stage with equity, a strong mission, and rapid professional growth

Location: Berlin

Type: Full-time




About the Company:

My client is a venture-backed, early-stage start-up based in Berlin, currently operating in stealth mode. They’re building cutting-edge LLM-powered copilots designed to automate and optimise complex operational workflows - bringing intelligent, context-aware decision-making into the heart of everyday business processes.




With a founding team of experienced entrepreneurs and AI specialists, they are now looking for a highly motivated Machine Learning Engineer to help design and scale the AI infrastructure that powers their core product.




The Opportunity:

This is a rare chance to join as one of the first technical hires and help shape both the product and technical direction of a company from the ground up. You’ll work closely with the founders on everything from model architecture and training pipelines to deployment and performance tuning. It’s a hands-on, high-impact role ideal for someone who thrives in fast-paced, product-driven environments.




Key Responsibilities:

Fine-tune and optimise open-source LLMs (e.g. Mistral, LLaMA, GPT-J) for domain-specific use cases.
Build and maintain retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with vector databases (e.g. FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate).
Develop scalable, efficient inference pipelines using tools like DeepSpeed, vLLM or Triton.
Integrate LLMs into real product features including agents, chat, summarisation, and knowledge retrieval.
Monitor performance, gather feedback, and iterate on models in production environments.
Contribute to key architectural decisions and help lay the foundations of the ML stack.




Must have:

3+ years’ experience in machine learning or NLP, ideally within start-up or high-growth tech environments.
Strong experience working with transformer models and frameworks like PyTorch and Hugging Face.
Proficiency in Python and hands-on experience with end-to-end ML workflows.
Familiarity with LLMs in production, including prompt engineering, embeddings, and RAG pipelines.
Proactive mindset—you’re curious, self-directed, and comfortable building in ambiguity.




Nice to have:

Knowledge of fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT, model distillation).
Experience deploying models with Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud-native stacks.
Exposure to agent-based architectures or tool-using LLMs (e.g. LangChain, ReAct).
Experience with CI/CD for ML systems or ML observability tooling.




What’s on Offer:

Impact – Help shape the direction of the AI stack powering a transformative product.
Autonomy – High degree of ownership, with the ability to move fast and experiment.
Environment – A low-ego, high-talent founding team with deep experience.
Flexibility – Remote-first culture with regular in-person time in Berlin if desired.
Equity – Competitive compensation with meaningful equity.

The company developed 5 apps and games that reached the #1 spot in the App Store across 3 continents.




Backed by some of the world's most esteemed investors, including Accel, Kevin Weil, Riccardo Zacconi, Scott Belsky, and Ilkka Paananen, SLAY is rapidly growing and reaching millions of users.




Our mission is to create digital life through AI and become the leading company for virtual friends that live, grow and evolve like humans—starting with Pengu. Pengu has become the biggest AI character app with its own IP in the US and Europe.


Tasks


We’re looking for an LLM engineer who will play a core role in shaping our product. You will be directly responsible for designing our data pipelines, fine-tuning architecture, and evaluation systems. You’ll make make important tradeoffs between ambition and feasibility. And you’ll run a tight loop between fine-tuning → evaluation → deployment.





Location: In-person working (Berlin). No remote/hybrid.


A-Players Only: We’re building a team of top-tier talent. A-players hire A-players. We’d rather invest in one exceptional person with an above-market salary they’re thrilled about than settle for multiple B-players at standard rates.


Drive: You’re relentless and motivated to do whatever it takes to succeed. You might have something to prove, a fire in your belly, or a mind that works differently. Work isn’t just a job—it’s a core part of who you are and how you find purpose.


Grind. We work/text on weekends and at night. It’s ok to send messages at 3am.


Urgency: Move at lightning speed—turn weeks into days, hours into minutes. Smash through obstacles to get results. Respond instantly, not eventually.


Relentless. Winning comes first. Follow up 10x a day if needed. Triple-text or call if someone’s ghosting you. Persistence is your superpower.


Fast Firing: We move on quickly from anyone who isn’t an A-player. You’ll need to be comfortable with this. Paid trials help us both figure out the fit upfront.


Mission-Driven: Our mission—“Becoming the leading company for virtual characters”—excites you. You’re here to make an impact.


Versatility: No task is beneath you. Wear many hats. No job is not your job.


EV-Based Decisions: We optimize for expected value, not comfort zones. No playing it safe with “good enough” choices.


Flat Structure: Flat company org. Titles reflect scope. No political promotion games.





If you’re an A-player ready to run hard and win big, this is your shot. Let’s build something extraordinary together.


Requirements



Having product sense is great


Bachelors' degree in Computer Science, or equivalent experience building software


Experience writing code to integrate models into production environments


Experience implementing and deploying systems for data collection, cloud model training and inference.


Experience translating current, relevant AI research into production systems.



Benefits



Total Compensation: €200k-€500k


Prime Berlin Office: Our Berlin Mitte office boasts state-of-the-art amenities, including Apple Studio Displays and Herman Miller chairs.


Full Commute Reimbursement: We cover 100% of your commuting costs.


Gym Membership: Stay fit and healthy on us.


Visa Sponsorship & Assistance: We support your visa process and guide you through all the paperwork.


Stock Options: Benefit from our competitive stock option program.


Bureaucratic Support: Assistance with German social security, tax forms, and other necessary paperwork.

Our client is a profitable, stable U.S.-based SaaS company used by over 20,000 property managers globally. Their robust platform helps simplify complex field inspections, capturing photos, videos, and voice notes—even offline—and turning them into detailed reports through powerful AI and advanced integrations.

Live since 2014 and active in 20+ countries, they've processed over 100 million inspection assets, consistently growing by turning complex workflows into user-friendly experiences.

Your Role:

This role is perfect for an experienced property manager or inspection professional who’s tech-savvy, detail-oriented, and ready for something new. You’ll join the product and engineering team—not to manage properties, but to help improve the software you wish you’d had on the job.

Your real-world insights will directly shape what gets built, improved, and prioritized. No coding required—you’ll learn product thinking on the job.

You’ll:


Work with designers and developers to improve inspection workflows, checklists, and UI flows.
Share feedback based on your own experience and help translate user pain points into feature ideas.
Help write clear, structured task outlines (user stories) to guide what the team builds.
Spot usability gaps in prototypes or early builds before they reach users.
Run quick feedback sessions or speak to users like you to validate decisions.
Contribute to release testing by ensuring edge cases and real-world needs are covered.


You Bring:


3+ years working in property management, field inspections, or real estate operations.
A strong grasp of real-world workflows—checklists, handoffs, maintenance coordination, inspection reports, etc.
You’ve used inspection software before (zInspector, HappyCo, RentCheck, etc.) and have opinions.
You like finding and fixing broken workflows—even if it means building a better process yourself.
You’re comfortable learning new tools and explaining complex steps clearly to others.
You’re looking for a long-term role in tech—and excited to grow into a product-focused career.


Bonus Points:


You've already created internal checklists, templates, or SOPs at your previous job.
You’ve worked with software vendors or given structured feedback on tools before.
You’ve trained team members or documented how a process works.
You’ve used low-code tools like Airtable, Zapier, Notion, etc.


What’s Offered:


Fully remote, flexible schedule, and generous PTO.
Competitive monthly USD compensation (flexible based on experience and fit).
Stable, profitable company with a small, product-focused team.
Hands-on mentorship and learning—you’ll grow into a product owner or product manager role over time.
A meaningful role: your work directly improves tools used daily by thousands of professionals in your industry.


Interview Process:

1️⃣ Intro Chat (30 min) – Talk about your experience & goals

2️⃣ Scenario Task (60 min) – Walk through a real inspection process and explore what you’d improve

3️⃣ Meet Product & Engineering (45 min) – How we work together, what success looks like

4️⃣ Final Call with Leadership (30 min) – Culture fit & offer conversation
