0-3 years of professional software-engineering experience, including internships or projects.
Basic experience in integrating with LLMs (e.g., Prompting, Evaluation, Observability).
Demonstrated interest in delivering AI-powered features that serve real users at scale (e.g., retrieval-augmented search, Generative AI assistants, predictive analytics).
Fluency in Python or at least one strongly-typed language (TypeScript or Java), with clean-code and testing discipline.
Understanding of cloud-native architectures (AWS or comparable), containerisation (Docker), and orchestration (Kubernetes / ECS).
Hands-on experience with MLOps: reproducible pipelines, automated evaluations, feature stores, CI/CD for models or prompt/embedding configs.
Strong data intuition: ability to inspect raw logs, design metrics, and quickly identify quality regressions.
Product mindset and empathy for end-users; able to translate fuzzy product requirements into incremental engineering plans.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills in English (spoken & written).

Time series modelling (both machine-learning and econometric approaches)
Application of a wide range of ML methodologies to real life applications
Enterprise software development (systems design, code review, version control, etc.)
Data orchestrators (Airflow, Dagster) and cloud-based ETL/ELT pipelines
Awareness of continuous integration and delivery concepts/technologies
