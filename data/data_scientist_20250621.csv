We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

What You'll Achieve

You will build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for critical decision-making, along with self-service tools that empower business partners
You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing sales outreach strategies or building a sales forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for GTM analytics



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Revenue Operations, Finance, Growth, Marketing
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy



Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Sales, Customer Success, Revenue Operations, and/or Finance teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)

Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing.




We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it.




Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively.




We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again.

This role puts you at the heart of our company’s evolution, giving you the opportunity to shape how we work, make data-driven decisions, and deliver exceptional value to our customers and teams.




What you'll do:
Partner with leaders and teams across the business to uncover high-impact opportunities, translating real business needs into innovative system and data solutions that drive company growth and operational excellence
Improve or build new capabilities in existing business systems and hand off to system owners throughout the company
Champion process optimization by identifying and implementing both technology-driven and strategic improvements, ensuring our business stays agile and competitive
Maintain a stack of business systems and build integrations and connections between them as needed
Define and document these processes and workflows in process diagrams, wireframes, mapping documents, functional specifications, non-functional specifications, ERDs, use cases, user stories, and logical data models
Serve as a trusted advisor and trainer, equipping end users and stakeholders with the knowledge and tools they need to maximize the impact of our systems and insights
Project manage external systems consultants, where necessary




About you:
5-10 years of work experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and business systems
Strong SQL and proficient Python knowledge
Experience with data warehouse technical architectures, infrastructure components, ETL/ ELT and reporting/analytic tools
Experience in API integrations and data migration/data conversion.
Experience with data visualization tools and packages (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Power BI)
Experience implementing business systems, sometimes from scratch (including understanding business processes, gathering user requirements, design, testing, deployment, and training)
Must have the ability to communicate, motivate and organize projects throughout the company
Must have ability to work independently and handle end-to-end projects







Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as a health & wellness stipend, 401k, parental leave, flexible PTO, commuter benefits, company wide events and more! 




Lumafield is committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, because the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.
