🌾 AgriTech | Forecasting | ML in Production

🧠 Data Intelligence for Global Food Supply Chains




We’re working exclusively with a well-backed AgTech startup building a next-generation data intelligence platform to transform food markets. Their goal?




To eliminate opacity in agricultural pricing and give traders, processors and growers the tools to make smarter, data-led decisions — from field to supply chain. They’re now hiring a Machine Learning Engineer to drive the forecasting engine at the heart of this platform — where models meet real-world market volatility.







🚀 Why join?




✔️ Mission-led – Help stabilise food pricing and promote fairer agricultural supply chains

✔️ Greenfield product – Build predictive systems from scratch: time series, demand signals, anomaly detection

✔️ Core tech role – Own the design, deployment and evolution of machine learning in production

✔️ Early-stage upside – Work directly with the founders and have real autonomy on an industry-defining product




🔧 What you’ll be doing




🔹 Build and deploy forecasting models to predict agricultural supply & demand

🔹 Design pipelines for ingestion, training, validation and live inference

🔹 Create robust benchmarking tools to evaluate model performance (backtesting, live scoring)

🔹 Solve for data volatility, sparse signals, and seasonal cycles in pricing

🔹 Collaborate with data engineers, economists and product leads to align models with user needs

🔹 Explore LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and simulation techniques for decision tooling




🧠 Ideal profile




✔️ 4+ years working with ML models in production

✔️ Strong Python skills (PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost) and familiarity with ML Ops tooling (MLflow, W&B, Keras, Tensorflow)

✔️ Production-level engineering skills — Docker, CI/CD, Azure, SQL, model monitoring

✔️ Deep understanding of data reliability, explainability and model evaluation in noisy domains

What’s more meaningful than seeing the real-world impact of your work?




Ok, maybe ending world hunger, but this is a strong second.

At OOONO, you’re not just building models in a notebook. You’re shaping the algorithms that directly power a physical product - used in real time by real people in the real world.

Join a small, collaborative team where you’re trusted to take ownership, test bold ideas, and push things into production. You’ll work hands-on with rich geospatial data to make our location logic smarter and faster.

And you’ll do it side by side with engineers, hardware specialists, and designers who genuinely care - about the product, the users, and each other.

What you’ll be doing

Develop and improve core algorithms to enhance product performance and user experience.
Contribute to map matching logic and road network analysis to improve location accuracy
Design, build, and maintain predictive models to solve complex business challenges.
Analyze large-scale data sets from Athena, MongoDB, and other sources to extract actionable insights.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Software, Hardware, UX/UI) to implement data-driven solutions.
Experiment with cutting-edge geospatial tools and frameworks to continuously improve analytical workflows.
Handle location data and geo spatial field.




We imagine you’re someone who has

A master’s degree in data science, geoinformatics or similar field
Proven experience (3+ years) in a Data Science role or similar, ideally within a tech environment and working with geospatial data
Proficiency in Python, including libraries such as Polars, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, Pyproj, Folium, Osmnx
Knowledge of geospatial analysis techniques (e.g., spatial joins, indexing, projections).
Strong understanding of statistical analysis, machine learning, and algorithm development.
Solid problem-solving skills and ability to work independently when needed
Hands-on person that can drive processes from A to B independently
English is a requirement.
Self-driven




How is it working at OOONO?

We’re glad we asked. It’s a nice working place. As in nice-nice. We have a relaxed, informal atmosphere and a flat hierarchy. Whenever you need a break from your important work stuff, you can get beat in table tennis, foosball, or just smalltalk about the weather by the coffee machine. We have monthly social events where we do anything from go-karting to going to festivals.

And when we’re not social? Then we’re pretty damn ambitious. We don’t like conservative targets or linear growth. We’re all about the extraordinary. This has led OOONO to become one of the fastest-growing tech scaleups and surprise-surprise: We have no plans of slowing down. So yes, OOONO is a lovely place to work, but it’s also a pretty good opportunity to develop as a person and take the next steps in your career.

Our innovative, fully automatic camera solution enables sports teams to record matches and training sessions without a camera operator. We’re democratizing the world of sports by granting video analysis for teams on all levels—a privilege that used to be only for the few. More than 40,000 clubs in 90+ countries record their games every week.

Growing as fast as we do in Veo means that every day is different, exciting, and challenging, both on the front line and in the back office.

But that’s not the most remarkable thing about us.

The coolest thing is our people. We’ve attracted some of the brightest minds in the industry. They are the reason we can create a great product and do it while enjoying ourselves.

As a Machine Learning Engineer at Veo you will get to work on challenging problems and directly contribute to the value created by our AI-driven end-user products.

You will become part of our AI team, which comprises 15 researchers and engineers responsible for all stages in the machine learning lifecycles across different projects - from scoping and defining data annotation tasks to modeling, validation, and deployment. You will be free to determine the directions of the project you work on while also getting feedback and being encouraged to spar with the rest of the team to assist each other in improving and succeeding.

We stay current with the latest research and continuously discuss concepts and ideas in recent papers to assess their relevance to our tasks and product-specific challenges.

We are looking to add yet another ambitious, high-performing junior to senior engineer/researcher with proven experience from real-world machine learning projects to the team. Experience with computer vision is advantageous but not a must.

What you will do:

Write efficient inference pipelines for cloud and edge
Define and supervise data annotation tasks
Improve evaluation schemes to increase understanding of model performance and shortcomings
Contribute to long-term planning and prioritization of tasks




What you will need:



MSc or PhD in a relevant field
Hands-on experience with real-world, large-scale machine-learning projects
Great coding skills
Skilled at both autonomous tasks and contributing to group efforts
Ability to examine details closely and critically




At Veo, you'll be part of a thriving work environment where every day brings new excitement. Our rapid growth ensures a diverse and ever-changing atmosphere. We believe in work-life balance and providing a positive culture that allows you to thrive personally and professionally.

Our Copenhagen office mirrors our innovative technology – with an indoor ball court, rooftop terrace, and well-equipped gym. We have created a facility that supports connecting disciplines across the business, facilitates creative thinking, and gives the space to engage with colleagues, our global partners, and the entire Veo community.

Diversity and differences are valuable assets for us. We value diversity and inclusion and welcome people from all backgrounds. If you’re excited about this role but your experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Values We Hold at Veo:

Dare - We take initiative, stay curious, and challenge the status quo in our work.

Own it - We drive impact by identifying opportunities, taking responsibility, and confidently executing.

Level up - We embrace growth, continuously learning and shaping our skills.

Play as a team - We collaborate across a diverse organization, leveraging shared insights for stronger outcomes.

Customer Centric - We deliver value by having close partnerships and a deep understanding of our customers (internally and externally)

We’re committed to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. And you may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.
