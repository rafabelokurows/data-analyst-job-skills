Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years ‚Äî scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company‚Äôs most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible ‚Äì insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc ‚Äì a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we‚Äôve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

How You Will Make An Impact


Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency


Preferred Experience


Bachelor‚Äôs degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python


Who You Are


You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company‚Äôs C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence

In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).<br><br></em><em>The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.<br><br></em><em>I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""<br><br></em><strong>How You Will Make An Impact<br><br></strong><ul><li>Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies</li><li>Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies</li><li>Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth</li><li>Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency <br><br></li></ul><strong>Preferred Experience<br><br></strong><ul><li>Bachelor‚Äôs degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline</li><li>1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis</li><li>High level of comfort with SQL or Python<br><br></li></ul><strong>Who You Are<br><br></strong><ul><li>You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles</li><li>You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company‚Äôs C-suite</li><li>You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence<br><br></li></ul><em>While we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.<br><br></em><em>Jerry.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.

Overall Responsibilities:

This posting is for an Epitaxy (Epi) New Product Introduction (NPI) instructor based in Austin, TX. This position is a combination technical instructor and technical expert role on existing and new products. The position is required to work within both the business unit (BU) Manufacturing located in Austin, TX and the GTLC Training Centers in Albany, NY and Xi‚Äôan China to learn the new products under development, gain experience on the startup and sustaining production tasks on the tool, and develop/deliver initial classroom and hands-on training on the tool. Once the tool transitions to volume production, the NPI instructor will train up the volume instructor, who then takes over the product from a training ownership standpoint.

Position will require learning, and application of that learning, on three fronts ‚Äì (1) training fundamentals; (2) existing products; and (3) new product training development. Training fundamentals will cover the training methodology, tools, materials and confidence to deliver both live distance learning (LDL) and instructor led hands on (ILT) course delivery. Existing products start with basic operations and maintenance, followed by trouble shooting and diagnostics, and eventually mastery of the tool. Product training development will require content development and project management skills to help bring a new tool design from concept to reality, through the development of comprehensive training curriculum, student guides, and supporting materials and technologies.

Due to the scheduling of PDP/NPI product development, the NPI instructor will often be researching, gaining knowledge/experience, and developing/delivering for several new tools/chambers at a time, so project management, training/presentation experience, and technical acumen (mechanical, electrical, troubleshooting, etc.) of semiconductor equipment is required.

Basic Breakdown Of Time Is:

~45% learning the new tool and gaining knowledge and experience (mechanical, electrical, software, process, etc.) and developing the course materials, structure and updating of existing courses

~35% delivering training or coordinating structured factory OJT

~20% other activities

Key Responsibilities


Deliver specialized New Product Introduction (NPI) technical training both in-house and at customer locations, requiring domestic and international travel.
