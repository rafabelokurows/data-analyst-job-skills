We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

As our Data Scientist for Go-to-Market, you will be a key business partner to our Sales and Revenue Operations team.

Each day will bring new challenges and opportunities to drive meaningful change with data.

What You'll Achieve


You will partner with Revenue Operations and Sales leads, driving forward all data science and analytics work in their functional areas
You will transform complex data into compelling insights, synthesizing them into crisp narratives for senior leadership that drive measurable business change (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
You will build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for critical decision-making, along with self-service tools that empower business partners
You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing sales outreach strategies or building a sales forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for GTM analytics



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Revenue Operations, Finance, Growth, Marketing
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy



Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Sales, Customer Success, Revenue Operations, and/or Finance teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

Apply causal inference methods to estimate the impact of payout changes



You Have:



1+ years of experience as a data scientist, data analyst, or a related field
Proficiency in SQL
Proficiency with Python or R
Understanding of Causal Inference concepts (ex/ DiD, matching, IPW, experiment design)
Strong communication skills across technical and non-technical stakeholders
High level of comfort creating dashboards



Bonus Points



Hands-on experience with Airflow, Sagemaker or deploying ML models in production environments
Strong familiarity with econometrics
Contribute to machine learning efforts in fraud or churn prediction

Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing.




We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it.




Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively.




We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again.




Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA.




About the role:




The ideal candidate for this role comes from a Data Science background with startup experience working with systems. If you thrive on solving big business problems, love connecting the dots between technology and strategy, and want to see your ideas come to life across the entire organization, this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. This role will be focused on providing critical insights to the business, as well as building and maintaining the required business systems, workflows, processes, and connections necessary to get those analyses up and running. As such, the role will require being comfortable handling a “full stack” of tasks at a high level, ranging from systems implementation, translating process requirements into systems requirements and vice versa, data engineering, and data analysis.




This role puts you at the heart of our company’s evolution, giving you the opportunity to shape how we work, make data-driven decisions, and deliver exceptional value to our customers and teams.




What you'll do:
Partner with leaders and teams across the business to uncover high-impact opportunities, translating real business needs into innovative system and data solutions that drive company growth and operational excellence
Improve or build new capabilities in existing business systems and hand off to system owners throughout the company
Champion process optimization by identifying and implementing both technology-driven and strategic improvements, ensuring our business stays agile and competitive
Maintain a stack of business systems and build integrations and connections between them as needed
Define and document these processes and workflows in process diagrams, wireframes, mapping documents, functional specifications, non-functional specifications, ERDs, use cases, user stories, and logical data models
Serve as a trusted advisor and trainer, equipping end users and stakeholders with the knowledge and tools they need to maximize the impact of our systems and insights
Project manage external systems consultants, where necessary




About you:
5-10 years of work experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and business systems
Strong SQL and proficient Python knowledge
Experience with data warehouse technical architectures, infrastructure components, ETL/ ELT and reporting/analytic tools
Experience in API integrations and data migration/data conversion.
Experience with data visualization tools and packages (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Power BI)
Experience implementing business systems, sometimes from scratch (including understanding business processes, gathering user requirements, design, testing, deployment, and training)
Must have the ability to communicate, motivate and organize projects throughout the company
Must have ability to work independently and handle end-to-end projects







Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as a health & wellness stipend, 401k, parental leave, flexible PTO, commuter benefits, company wide events and more! 




Lumafield is committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, because the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Do you feel like your skills don’t meet every single requirement listed? We encourage you to apply anyway – If you’re excited about our technology, the opportunity, and are eager to learn more we’d love to hear from you!  




In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information or veteran status. 




Reach out if you want to be a part of what we are building.
