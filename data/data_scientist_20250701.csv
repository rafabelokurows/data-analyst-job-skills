Job Description

We are on the lookout for a Data Scientist with linguistic expertise, to join our team and help us create outstanding customer service products. This is a unique opportunity to apply deep linguistic expertise to the challenges of building customer facing, conversational products using NLP, machine learning and generative AI.

You will join the Service Data Science squad on our mission to automate and optimize interactions with customers, making sure they have a high quality experience that scales as our business grows. In this specialist role, you will be the team's expert on the analysis and evaluation of language data, focusing on the nuances of user intent, conversational context, and error analysis to drive the performance of our products. If you also have experience in applying modelling approaches to conversational or other language problems, even better!

If you are a creative problem solver with a passion for language and technology, and you're hungry for a new adventure, a diverse, international and inclusive workplace is waiting for you in the heart of Berlin!

Your mission:

Lead Linguistic Analysis: Dive deep into user conversations to uncover the root causes of model underperformance, using your expertise in pragmatics, semantics, and syntax in multiple languages to identify opportunities for model improvement.

Enhance Model Evaluation and Modelling Approaches: Design, build, and implement fine-grained evaluation datasets and observability tools that move beyond standard metrics to give us high-confidence insights into our models' linguistic capabilities. Use the learnings to improve our models.

Drive Product Improvement: Translate your linguistic analysis into actionable data requirements and strategies that directly improve key business outcomes, such as first-contact resolution and customer satisfaction.

Collaborate and Grow: Work closely with Data Scientists, ML Engineers, and Product Managers to solve practical problems, and have fun while growing together with your team.

Qualifications


A strong academic or professional background in Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, or a related field.
Demonstrable expertise in linguistic analysis, particularly in areas like pragmatics, semantics, ambiguity resolution, and conversational analysis.
Proficiency in Python for data analysis, including experience with libraries like Pandas and creating readable, reproducible analyses (e.g., in Jupyter notebooks).
Experience with SQL for accessing and processing data.
Proven ability to perform detailed error analysis on language data and a solid understanding of how to curate high-quality, annotated datasets.
You are a highly autonomous problem solver, capable of leading projects and delivering results with minimal guidance.
You are fluent in English.
Bonus points: Experience with NLP technologies (e.g., LLMs, BERT, Transformer models) would be amazing, as would experience working on solving language tasks in multiple languages!

They're building intelligent systems that do more than just automate — they understand, adapt, and learn in real time. And now they’re looking for a Data Scientist to shape the next phase of their AI-driven product evolution.




As a core member of the Data Science team, you won’t just be running models — you’ll be designing end-to-end data workflows, building and evaluating state-of-the-art AI systems, and working alongside engineers and product teams to translate insights into real-world impact. This is your opportunity to work on bleeding-edge ML with purpose — in an environment where experimentation and bold ideas are part of the DNA.




What you’ll be working with:

A modern data stack: Python, SQL, and TypeScript (for integration)
Leading ML/AI frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, HuggingFace
Scalable infrastructure: GCP, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Firestore, AlloyDB
Productionizing ML: from fine-tuning foundation models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.) to optimizing deployment pipelines
Cross-functional collaboration with engineers, designers, and domain experts to shape smart, adaptive AI products




What they’re looking for:

Strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and modern data science libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
Hands-on experience with ML model development and deployment (bonus: exposure to LLMs and generative AI)
A solid grasp of data architecture, experimentation, and performance evaluation
A collaborative mindset with a track record of working across disciplines to solve complex problems
Experience in startup or fast-paced environments is a plus




Why this role?

Autonomy & Ownership: You’ll shape how data science is done — from tools to strategy
Impact: Your models and insights will directly influence core product experiences
