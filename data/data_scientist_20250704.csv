Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
Use CI/CD processes for automated testing, deployment, and monitoring.
Ensure reliability and maintainability of deployed models.

Here’s what we are looking for:


Educational background from a quantitative field, such as Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Engineering etc
Proven experience with SQL and are either fluent in Python or some other modeling language such as R or SAS and have a desire to learn Python.
You have previously been involved in implementing machine learning models into a production environment.



As a person, we’re looking for someone with a doer's attitude and willingness to actively contribute to the work we do.You are inquisitive and enjoy learning new technologies, techniques, and tools. Further on, we assume you love big data sets, and to discover and communicate insights derived from data.

Why join us?

We're offering a unique opportunity to be part of a growing fintech company that's redefining financial services for small businesses in Northern Europe. You'll get to work with cutting-edge techniques and a fun, passionate, and innovative group. We're dedicated to building an environment where everyone can thrive and work-life balance is truly valued.

A few last things

This is a full-time, permanent position based from our office in Stockholm (Drottninggatan 98). While we encourage a hybrid setup, we do expect you to be at least three days per week at the office. Don’t wait to send in your application, we are reviewing applications on a rolling basis. While the start date is flexible, the right candidate can join us immediately.
