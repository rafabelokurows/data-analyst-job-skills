They're building intelligent systems that do more than just automate — they understand, adapt, and learn in real time. And now they’re looking for a Data Scientist to shape the next phase of their AI-driven product evolution.




As a core member of the Data Science team, you won’t just be running models — you’ll be designing end-to-end data workflows, building and evaluating state-of-the-art AI systems, and working alongside engineers and product teams to translate insights into real-world impact. This is your opportunity to work on bleeding-edge ML with purpose — in an environment where experimentation and bold ideas are part of the DNA.




What you’ll be working with:

A modern data stack: Python, SQL, and TypeScript (for integration)
Leading ML/AI frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, HuggingFace
Scalable infrastructure: GCP, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Firestore, AlloyDB
Productionizing ML: from fine-tuning foundation models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.) to optimizing deployment pipelines
Cross-functional collaboration with engineers, designers, and domain experts to shape smart, adaptive AI products




What they’re looking for:

Strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and modern data science libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
Hands-on experience with ML model development and deployment (bonus: exposure to LLMs and generative AI)
A solid grasp of data architecture, experimentation, and performance evaluation
A collaborative mindset with a track record of working across disciplines to solve complex problems
Experience in startup or fast-paced environments is a plus




Why this role?

Autonomy & Ownership: You’ll shape how data science is done — from tools to strategy
Impact: Your models and insights will directly influence core product experiences
Real-world AI: Build systems that are used, not just published

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive. 

That's why, since 2016, we've been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they're at the heart of everything we do.

We've sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.


Who we're looking for

We are looking for a highly motivated Junior Data Scientist, who is keen on building advanced predictive models and joining our growing Core Pricing team. The mission is to build a world-class Data Science team that turns ideas and resolves complex challenges into production-grade pricing and risk models effectively, safely, and consistently.


What you'll do

Explore & analyse large telematics, policy and quote datasets to uncover trends and opportunities
Build and validate statistical & machine learning models that power pricing and risk selection
Collaborate with Engineering, Actuarial and Product to frame business problems and productionise models
Communicate insights clearly through dashboards, visualisations and storytelling
Contribute to best practice in code review, experimentation and shaping our ways of working as you grow



What you'll bring

Recently completed Bachelor's or Master's in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Economics or a related quantitative field
At least one year of experience in a data related field
Strong grounding in probability, statistics and machine learning fundamentals
Working knowledge of Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit‑learn), and basic SQL
Curiosity, problem‑solving mindset and the ability to present complex ideas simply
Right to work in the UK




Nice to have (but not essential)

Internship or course project involving real‑world data analysis or modelling
Familiarity with cloud platforms (e.g. AWS) and version control (git)
Experience with BI / visualisation tools (e.g. Looker)



What's it like to work at Zego?

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things. 

We're spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We're proud of our company and our culture - a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

You'll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren't afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we're making insurance matter. 


How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. We think it's a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.


Our approach to AI

We believe in the power of AI to meaningfully improve how we work - helping us move faster, think differently, and focus on what matters most. At Zego, we encourage people to stay curious and intentional about how AI is leveraged in their work and teams to drive practical impact every day. This is your chance to do the most meaningful work of your career - and we'll provide you with the tools, support, and freedom to do it well.
