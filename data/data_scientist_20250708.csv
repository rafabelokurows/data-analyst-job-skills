Company Description

ARGO is building the fastest AI engine to understand small companies (SME) across the UK & US. This will improve how SMEs access financial services. SMEs are the engine of any economy, we need to do better for them to thrive.

The company was started by serial entrepreneurs with a strong track record. We have an office in Shoreditch and are backed by prominent venture capital firms from the US & Europe.

This is an AI startup that is heavy on Data, ML Algorithms + LLMs.

Role Description

This is a full-time hybrid role for a Senior Engineer (ML Engineer):


Strong background in Pattern Recognition, Computer Science, and Statistics
Expertise in LLMs and Algorithms
Experience with data preprocessing and feature extraction
Proficiency in programming languages like Python or R (4+ years)
Knowledge of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch
Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills
What you don't know, we can teach - as long as you have the desire to learn.
We are a group of serious engineers, and looking to add a few more who have experience with Python, Machine learning, data pipelines and scalable infrastructure (we are mostly on AWS)
This is a startup, so being able to sit across a few areas is always appreciated. You are going to be treated like a member of the Founding team and get to participate in key decisions.
We will be filing patents for some of our work, and you can be involved should you be interested in being named on a patent.


Other Details

The company is ~12 people, we are now looking to bring on 3 more Engineers who can build this further. We are live in the market serving customers and earning revenue.

Our work spans across Data, Machine Learning and intelligent use of LLMs to enable us to reach the capability of human underwriters. This is a big challenge that will take us a few years to reach, but we have a strong headstart given the founding team's prior experiences within this field. And the impact on any economy is significant as SMEs often employ over half the population.
