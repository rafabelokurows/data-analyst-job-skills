Who We Are: Prior Labs is building breakthrough foundation models that understand spreadsheets and databases—the backbone of science and business. Foundation models have transformed text and images, but structured data has remained largely untouched. We’re tackling this $100B+ opportunity to revolutionize how we approach scientific discovery, medical research, financial modeling, and business intelligence.




Our Impact: We aim to be the world-leading organization working on structured data. Our TabPFN v2 model, recently published in Nature, sets the new state-of-the-art for small structured data. Our models have gained significant traction with 1M+ downloads and 3,500+ GitHub stars. We are now building the next generation of models that combine AI advancements with specialized architectures for structured data.

Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.

Payrails is a global payment software company helping leading enterprises to take control of their payment operations and maximize performance. With deep experience in the payments space and firsthand knowledge of merchants' challenges, we’ve seen how fragmented, complex, and inefficient these systems can become. Now, we are setting a new industry standard for how enterprises around the world manage and optimize payments, with more control, visibility and flexibility than ever before.

Our vision is to reimagine payments from the ground up. We are building a deeply integrated meta layer that spans the entire payment lifecycle with a modular architecture. This helps us give leading brands building blocks to craft solutions to most complex operational challenges, tailor seamless customer experiences and grow their business.

We are backed by some of the world’s top investors including Andreessen Horowitz, HV Capital, EQT Ventures and General Catalyst, who share our mission to simplify payment complexity globally.

At Payrails, we’re committed to building a team of exceptional people - not just talented, but driven to build, solve, and deliver at the highest level. Excellence isn’t just a value here; it’s a way of working. We believe that great people thrive in environments where there’s trust, clarity, and shared purpose. We work openly and collaboratively, with deep respect for each other’s craft. Everyone is encouraged to understand the bigger picture - what we’re building, why it matters, and what stands in the way. When people have that context, they move faster, take ownership, and make better decisions. We care about creating a culture where people feel inspired to do their best work and a deep sense of responsibility to help us bring our vision to life. Success at Payrails means staying focused on the problems that matter most, and executing with purpose.

Backed by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, the IPA, and Sky, Barb has been the source of official TV viewing figures for decades. 




Barb is uniquely placed to empower transformation of the UK TV and advertising ecosystem through reliable and accurate data.  




These data fulfil three purposes:  




To support decisions that are made in the making and distribution of great programmes.  
To support the planning and buying of ad campaigns and informing on brand and sales outcomes.  
To inform how broadcasters and other media services operate in the public interest. 




As the media industry evolves, so does Barb. We've expanded our measurement beyond traditional panels to incorporate large-scale online data and streaming services. Through our campaign reporting tools, Barb also provides the full picture of cross-platform pre and post campaign reporting. 




Our hybrid approach combines people-based panel data with census-level device data to deliver inclusive measurement of total identified viewing across all platforms, services, and devices. This empowers broadcasters, advertisers, and regulators to make more better, fairer, more informed decisions. 




Overview 

We’re seeking a Junior Data Scientist to help build the future of UK audience measurement. This is a unique opportunity to join a small, expert team of 13, reporting directly to the Head of Data Science and working on foundational systems used by major media organisations across the UK. 




You can expect to work on high-impact projects including: 




The Barb Data Hub, a centralised Snowflake data warehouse serving as the single source of truth for Barb data. You’ll help develop a library of reusable analysis tools. 
Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Sharing – ensuring users can apply Barb’s complex methodologies efficiently and accurately. 
Barb Panel Plus, a new system integrating “return path data” from TV sets and set-top boxes with existing panel data. 




These projects pose exciting challenges from the point of view of data engineering, statistical modelling, and software development. This role will be of interest to someone starting their career as a data scientist and excited by the prospect of finding brilliant solutions to these problems. The role would be well-suited to someone who is a talented coder, logical thinker, enjoys working with data, has an interest in the TV industry, and is looking to grow into their career as a data scientist. 




Key responsibilities 




Work closely with the Barb executive team and partners to understand and implement the Barb Calculation Methodology, which is a complex set of conventions and algorithms that describe how to use Barb panel data to calculate standard audience metrics. 
Build and maintain a shared library of reusable data analysis tools for Barb’s users and suppliers. 
Support users of Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Share, ensuring they produce correct and industry-standard outputs. 
Translate parts of the methodology into reliable, production-ready Python code for use across Barb’s systems. 
Contribute to the evaluation and development of statistical and machine learning models for return path data integration. 
Develop ELT pipelines and modelling solutions for data integration projects. 

 




Qualifications 




A degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., STEM, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics). 
Good working knowledge of Python and SQL. 
Experience with Python data packages (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) preferred. 
Strong mathematical and statistical foundation. 
Ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with others. 

 

Experience 




The ideal candidate will have some experience with: 

Data engineering; working with databases, building infrastructure for moving, storing, and processing data.  
Modelling; analysing data using statistical or machine-learning techniques 




Preferred: 

Experience with Snowflake, or other cloud data platforms such as Databricks or BigQuery. 
Familiarity with Snowpark or similar distributed computing frameworks such as Spark. 

For graduates, the above could include projects done at university or during an internship. 




 




Benefits 




Base salary will reflect the responsibilities of the role and be commensurate with experience. Barb offers a discretionary bonus scheme alongside the following benefits. 




Office in central London – with hybrid working options 
Pension contributions up to a maximum of 9% of salary — employees’ contribution matched +3% 
Five weeks paid holiday — rising to six weeks after 10 years’ service 
Holiday purchase scheme — purchase up to five additional days in any calendar year 
Group Life Assurance — four times annual salary 
Group Income Protection — 75% of salary after 26 weeks absence 
Enhanced pay for parental/adoption leave after 18 months of service — 13 weeks at 100% of basic salary followed by 26 weeks at the statutory rate

Location: London (office-based, ~4 days per week)

Build Something That Matters

native has been building for 10 years, but we're still very much a startup: fast-moving, ambitious, and building with intent. We're creating the infrastructure that connects students, Students’ Unions, universities, and advertisers through a managed marketplace.

Our goal is to increase student engagement while enabling Students’ Unions to secure sustainable funding. For advertisers, we offer meaningful, measurable routes to student audiences. The more aligned these incentives are, the more defensible and scalable our business becomes.

We’re looking for graduates who want to step straight into meaningful work, learn quickly, and grow fast.

What We’re Looking For

We value clarity of thought, good judgement under pressure, and the ability to create structure where none exists.

You Might Be Right For This If


You think in first principles, not borrowed answers – solving problems from the ground up
You thrive in ambiguity – you’re comfortable making decisions when there isn’t a map
You do the work – not for applause, but because it matters to you that things are done well
You’ve got range – you’re not just smart on paper; you’ve done things that demanded resilience, judgement, or initiative


We are open to a wide range of degree backgrounds, but we look for intellectual sharpness and structured thinking. That often shows up in disciplines like engineering, maths, philosophy, languages (whether classical or modern), or history - but not always. If your academic path is less typical, help us understand how your thinking has been shaped and why it stands up.

What You’ll Be Working On

You'll be directly involved in:


Developing predictive models to identify patterns in student behaviour and engagement, using real data from hundreds of thousands of students
Refining student personas by analysing survey responses, behavioural data, and qualitative insights, ensuring accuracy and usefulness
Conducting advanced statistical analysis and clustering to uncover insights about student segments, motivations, and behaviours
Collaborating closely with the Student Personas team to translate analytical findings into clear, actionable recommendations
Creating robust documentation and clearly communicating your methods and results, ensuring reproducibility and clarity


This role is deeply analytical and technical, designed to rapidly build your practical skills in data science and predictive modelling within a real, high-impact environment

Required Skills

You'll be right for this role if:


You have strong analytical skills, demonstrated by excellent academic results, research projects, academic papers, or high placements in data science competitions
You have practical experience with statistical modelling or machine learning techniques (regression analysis, clustering, classification, predictive modelling) through coursework, internships, or independent projects
You are proficient in Python (especially pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, or similar libraries) and comfortable performing data analysis using Jupyter notebooks or similar tools
You are comfortable writing clear, efficient SQL for extracting, cleaning, and preparing datasets, demonstrated through coursework, internships, or personal analytical projects
You have demonstrated initiative by independently exploring additional analytical and machine learning tools or frameworks, such as BigQuery, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar


Progression

This is an initial six-month engagement. If you perform well, the expectation is that you’ll move into a promoted, permanent role at the end of that period. We treat this as a proving ground for long-term hires, not an internship.

During your interview process, you'll be encouraged to speak with previous graduate hires at native who joined through this route, so you can hear directly how this role can set you up for rapid career progression.

Location and ways of working

You’ll be based in our London office, working in person at least four days a week, with one optional day remote. We believe in high-bandwidth collaboration and fast decision-making, so most of the work happens face-to-face.

How To Apply

We don’t want a cover letter. Instead, answer a few questions we have which will help us understand how you think:


A trade-off you’ve had to make and how you decided
A problem you tackled without much guidance
A system or process you’d redesign and how you’d go about it
A time you had to choose what not to do, and why


Also please do include a recent CV, or a link to your LinkedIn profile / equivalent.

And If you’re reading this and thinking, I really want to do this, but I probably won’t get picked - apply anyway. We care far more about how you think and how you show up than whether you tick every imagined box. Don’t rule yourself out.

We’re hiring on a rolling basis. If this sounds like the kind of challenge you’re ready for, get in touch.

Equal Opportunity Statement

We are actively creating an equitable environment for everyone at native to thrive.

Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at native. At native, we embrace diversity in all of its forms and foster an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us.

Get curious, dive deep into our data to improve our foundational metrics
Audit & improve data infrastructure, document data sources and build pipelines
Own core company dashboards and refine them to make insights accessible to the full team.
Create a shared vocabulary across products and operations (e.g., “active user,” “successful transaction,” etc.).


3+ Months


Scale our analytics culture through education, process, and documentation. You’ll turn yourself into a multiplier
Work closely with product and ops on growth experiments, operational bottlenecks, and behavioural insights
Own continuous improvements to data quality, modelling, and warehouse efficiency

This individual will play an integral role in helping us understand our growing data, which will directly influence our strategic decisions. The ideal candidate is nifty, detail-oriented, and has a keen interest in exploring and unraveling complex data trends. Familiarity with the world of cryptocurrencies is a plus, but not a requirement.

In general, we want an experienced, flexible, and driven data scientist who has a broad range of knowledge in the field rather than a specialist who has focused on a specific area. They need to be autonomous and self-motivated, who can work with other teams to measure the impact of changes, as well as identifying problems, then developing and implementing solutions.

Requirements


Proficient with Python/R and SQL/Bigquery.
Experience designing, running, and analysing A/B tests (experiments) on a tech consumer product.
2-3 years Minimum of experience at a startup, scale-up Crypto company.
Demonstrated experience of autonomy and agency in overseeing entire projects from identifying problems, testing solutions to communicating results.
Can work full time in London 5 days a week.


Preferred


Experience with crypto and blockchain data.
Strong data visualisation skills (esp. Graphana)
Experience with events tracking data (esp. FullStory)
Strong statistical or causal inference skills.
Experience building data pipelines (esp. Dataform)
Experience with Machine Learning methods.


Additional Notes For Product Data Scientist

Autonomous and Self-Motivated: here we want someone who is going to be pro-active (identify and find work) rather than reactive (be assigned work). Either reaching out to other teams to help them with measurement of changes, or who can spot problems/opportunities and drive forward changes needed.

Specialist vs Generalist: ideally here we want someone who isn’t too excessively focused on a specific aspect of Data Science (e.g. only ML experience, only experience with non-experimental methods)

Consumer Product: this means basically any work that was focused on an app or website, rather than more general data science (finance, health, education, economics, etc.). When the data scientist was involved in measuring changes to the app/website.

Overseeing Projects: what we mean here is that the person has experience managing projects directly. From the ideation phase, to prioritisation, stakeholder management, design/analysis, and rollout.

Data Visualisation: this would involve building and automating dashboards (experience with Graphana is a plus here), but also being able to visualise data analysis in a clear, concise, digestible format.

Racking Data: this type of data captures how a user moves throughout (and interacts with) our website: the consumer funnel. What they clicked, what sessions they had, did they place an order, did they experience an error, etc.. Our tracking data comes from FullStory so experience with it is a plus.

Statistical or Causal Inference: these capture non-experimental methods of data analysis. Essentially, can this person give us learnings and insights from non-experimental (observational) data. This work is often the type of thing that starts experimental work: you see something interesting, dig into it and find the relationships, build a hypothesis of what is going on and then run an experiment to test that. It would also include econometric modelling methodologies (using correlations to model the impact of a change).

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Job Overview

As a Machine Learning Engineer II, you independently design, build, and maintain machine learning systems that deliver impact for our customers and business. You are responsible for deploying reliable, scalable solutions — from credit scoring models to intelligent automation and LLM-powered features. You work across the stack to connect ML systems with real user value.

You own end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and transformation to model training, validation, and online inference. You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

What You’ll Do


Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more. Due to high application volume, we may not be able to respond to everyone.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

The Future is Omnichain.

Founded in 2021, LayerZero’s vision is to create a community of cross-chain developers, building dApps that are no longer constrained by individual blockchain capabilities. With LayerZero's simple, generic messaging protocol, builders will develop cross-chain dApps designed to unify the power of individual blockchains.

We are funded by the best investors in the world including:

a16z, Sequoia, PayPal, Binance Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Uniswap Labs, Circle Ventures, Delphi Digital, and many more.

About The Role

We’re hiring our first AI Enablement Engineer to lead one of the most important initiatives at LayerZero: embedding AI deeply into our internal operations to drive productivity, scale, and operational excellence. This is a rare opportunity to shape how our organization functions—using AI to amplify the impact of every team member and help us operate like a 1000-person company, even as a 100-person team.

You’ll work directly with our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Technology Officer to identify high-leverage business problems and build internal tools and automations that solve them. Your north star is simple: use AI to save time, reduce friction, and make LayerZero a more powerful, effective, and enjoyable place to work.

This isn’t a research role or a theoretical position—it’s deeply practical. You’ll talk to people across the company to understand their workflows, identify bottlenecks, and build internal AI-powered products that unlock efficiency. You’ll also help shape our broader approach to AI adoption, ensuring that employees across the company have access to tools that empower them.

What You'll Do


Build and maintain internal tools and automations that use LLMs and other AI models to streamline operations and give our teams more leverage, including automating your own workflow wherever possible using the latest capabilities.
