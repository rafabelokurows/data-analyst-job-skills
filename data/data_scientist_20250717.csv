A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Power digital products with AI. Work with product teams to identify high-impact opportunities where AI can transform the user experience for millions—and then build the solutions to make them happen. Drive the process from possibility to production, delivering code that’s robust, reproducible, and built for scale.
Explore ways to push the boundaries of our AI capabilities. Stay at the bleeding edge of AI by investigating new models, techniques, and research. Learn fast across new domains, share findings with the team, and turn breakthrough ideas into production systems that deliver real-world impact.
Refine data foundations for exceptional results. Own the full data lifecycle—from acquisition and labeling to loading and management—to ensure our models are trained on clean, high-quality datasets that power top-performing systems.
Own your impact, end-to-end. Set smart priorities, manage execution, and consistently deliver high-quality results, even in ambiguous or fast-changing environments. Balance technical depth with strong ownership, growing your skills while delivering meaningful contributions.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.

Before you apply
Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We're extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don't hesitate to apply.

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested through this form.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

New York, NY | $300–400k + Equity

Overview

We are looking for best-in-class ML Engineers who are experts in Reinforcement Learning (RL) & Visual Language Models (VLM) for a robotics start-up based in New York.

This startup is developing highly flexible, general-purpose robotic systems powered by cutting-edge AI. Their systems are already deployed with real customers, generating both revenue and valuable data. Rather than building humanoids or speculative prototypes, this company focuses on practical, AI-enabled robots that can be installed in hours and rapidly trained to perform real-world tasks.

Backed by a strong founding team and early-stage investment, the company is now scaling up deployments and expanding its technical team. This is an opportunity to work across the entire robotics stack and help shape the future of real-world automation.

Key Responsibilities

The successful candidate will play a hands-on role in the research, development, and deployment of advanced machine learning models for robotic control. Responsibilities include:


Designing and implementing Reinforcement Learning algorithms for robotic manipulation and task execution.
Developing and integrating Vision-Language Models to enable robots to understand and act upon high-level natural language commands and visual inputs.
Working with large-scale datasets for training and fine-tuning ML models, including data collection and augmentation strategies.
Collaborating with robotics software engineers to integrate ML models into the real-time control stack.
Optimizing and deploying ML models to ensure low-latency performance on robotic hardware.
Conducting experiments and evaluations to benchmark model performance and identify areas for improvement.
Staying up-to-date with the latest research in RL, VLM, and embodied AI.


Key Requirements


Strong machine learning fundamentals with a proven track record of delivering production-quality ML models.
Expertise in Reinforcement Learning (RL), including experience with various RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC, DDPG) and frameworks (e.g., Stable Baselines, Ray RLlib).
Experience working with Vision-Language Models (VLM), including familiarity with models like CLIP, DALL-E, or similar, and their application to robotic perception and control.
Proficiency with Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
Experience with large-scale data processing and training for deep learning models.
Familiarity with robotics concepts and an understanding of how ML models interact with physical systems.
Strong problem-solving skills and a collaborative approach to research and development.


Bonus Experience


Experience with robot simulation tools (e.g., MuJoCo, Isaac Gym) for training and evaluating RL agents.
Background in computer vision or natural language processing.
Familiarity with robot operating systems (ROS/ROS2).
Publications in top-tier ML or robotics conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CoRL, RSS).
Experience deploying ML models to edge devices or embedded systems.


Why This Opportunity?

This is not a research lab in isolation. The company is already shipping robots and scaling fast. Engineers here work on systems that are used daily by real customers, generating value and shaping the roadmap for physical AI. The role offers strong compensation, early-stage equity, and the chance to help build something genuinely impactful from the ground up.

For ML Engineers who thrive on seeing their models come to life in the real world and have owned outcomes from concept to deployment, this is a unique opportunity to do it again - on a bigger stage, at the forefront of physical AI.

Interested?

I’m currently representing the team and would be happy to share more details confidentially. Please reach out to arrange a conversation.

We look for candidates who are curious, proactive problem-solvers and excited to collaborate in a fast-paced environment. A growth mindset, positive outlook and a drive to learn and lead are key to success in this role.

 

While casework varies every day, Associates’ primary responsibilities typically include:

 


Conducting primary and secondary research on clients’ markets, customers, and competitors


 


Performing rigorous analysis to drive insights and actionable recommendations


 


Collaborating with team members to communicate key findings to the client in written presentations and verbal interactions that deliver maximum impact


L.E.K. offers associates the broadest range of fast-paced, high-impact, and diverse cases for maximum learning. We are also committed to investing in your training and development and fostering excellent analytical and leadership skills to prepare you for your progression in tenure, as well as for potential future opportunities in top graduate schools or roles in industry, non-profits, start-ups, or investment firms.

 

In addition to very competitive compensation and benefits, we promote Associates to Consultant and beyond, based on demonstrated performance.

 

 

 

WHY L.E.K.?

 

The Associate role at L.E.K. is differentiated from other firms in several key ways:

 


Immediate workstream responsibility: L.E.K. Associates are expected to be integral members of the team from day 1, immediately driving mission-critical work to help solve critical challenges for our clients.


 


Breadth of experiences: While our projects span most industries and services, our focus is strategy and M&A. Associates typically work on ~6-10 projects a year, providing greater exposure across clients and strategic issues, as well as faster development of business acumen.


 


Fun, collaborative, stimulating work environment: L.E.K. teams spend substantially more time in their home office relative to teams at peer firms, and we pride ourselves on a vibrant social culture, including case team events, office parties, non-profit involvement, and much more.
International exposure: Approximately 65% of Associates gain international exposure within their first 3 years, either through projects staffed across global offices, travel to international client locations, or, if they choose, by relocating to an international office on either a temporary or a full-time basis. .


 


Upward mobility: L.E.K. is a meritocracy with an entrepreneurial culture and frequent feedback. We rapidly progress responsibility to accelerate our team’s development.


Qualifications And Experience Needed


A bachelor’s degree from a renowned school with outstanding academic achievement
Exceptional analytical and problem-solving skills
Strong verbal and written communication skills
Demonstrated leadership, initiative and ability to thrive in a team-oriented environment
Enthusiasm, resilience, and a desire to continuously learn and grow


Note: Sector specialization is assessed during the interview process and determined at the time of hire for candidates who both meet the qualifications and express a strong interest in dedicating to a specific sector. If you are particularly interested in Organization & Performance (O&P), Life Sciences (LS), or Financial Services (FS), please clearly indicate this in your cover letter.

L.E.K. Consulting offers a competitive salary and benefits package commensurate with experience. The base salary is $95,000 (USD); L.E.K. also offers a performance bonus, profit sharing, and other benefits.

Applicants for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States on a permanent basis without the need for employer sponsorship.

Re‑architect how humanity powers itself.

🚀 About Everstar is a venture‑backed deep‑tech startup building the first AI‑native platform to unlock commercially viable nuclear technologies and democratize a multi‑trillion‑dollar energy sector. Together we’re fusing frontier artificial intelligence with atomic engineering to bend the cost, safety, and speed curves of clean power.

The Mission

We need a Senior AI Engineer who already lives at the bleeding edge and has scar‑tissue from shipping enterprise‑scale AI into production.

You will own the R&D roadmap and lead a small, elite engineering pod to push the boundaries of:


Foundation‑model development (physics‑informed LLMs & diffusion models)
Novel algorithm design for data‑scarce, safety‑critical domains
Autonomous control agents for safety verification, manufacturing robotics, reactor operations


You will report directly to our CEO, Kevin Kong, and have the mandate—and the resources—to set Everstar’s technical direction during a once‑in‑a‑generation market inflection.

Core Requirements


10+ years total engineering experience, 5+ years architecting or leading production AI/ML systems at Fortune‑500 or hyperscale‑startup level.
Proven enterprise impact: you’ve shipped at least one mission‑critical AI product (e.g., billion‑parameter model servicing millions of daily requests, or revenue‑integral decision engine).
Deep mastery of PyTorch (or JAX/Flax), CUDA, distributed training (DDP/FSDP) and heterogeneous hardware scaling (H100s, ASICs).
Demonstrated tech‑lead/EM chops: you’ve hired, mentored, and driven roadmap execution for ≥3 engineers.
Systems thinker—able to redesign kernels or data pipelines for 10× throughput & 99.99 % uptime.
U.S. citizenship (required) and full‑time on‑site presence in NYC (no remote/relocation assistance provided).
Passion for nuclear, energy, or other safety‑critical verticals; you master domain constraints quickly.
Exceptional communicator—can brief C‑suite, investors, regulators, and junior ICs with equal clarity.


Bonus Points


Lead author on ≥2 NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR papers or prior stint at a frontier AI lab.
Track record of open‑sourcing production‑ready AI/ML infra (Triton kernels, inference compilers, Ray Serve, etc.).
Experience coupling AI/ML with finite‑element, Monte‑Carlo, or multi‑physics simulators.
Familiarity with DOE/NRC compliance or other safety‑critical software certification.


Compensation & Perks


$170K-230K base salary + competitive equity (with potential refreshers post‑Series A).
Full medical, dental, vision, pre‑tax commuter benefits.
Annual conference budget (NeurIPS, ICML, APS, ANS) + generous R&D stipend.
Empowered, mission‑driven culture where excellence is the floor, not the ceiling.

Ask us anything

Got a question?

How does your hiring process work?


>


Everything starts with your application, of course! If you see an open position that seems like a match made in heaven, send us your resume. We'll review it and reach out to you to plan a introductory meeting if it seems like a match (on paper). If that first meeting goes well, we'll plan a technical test (if necessary) and an interview with some people on the team. This way, we'll know for sure if you'll fit in. If all goes well, we'll give you an offer you hopefully can't refuse.

Are you remote-friendly?


>


Yes! We value a hybrid work environment, which means you can work at home, at our offices, or in your favorite coffee shop. You decide where you want to work, but we do love it when our team comes together on our weekly ""team days"" (two times per week). We promise, you'll love it too.

What are your values?


>


Curiosity, entrepreneurship, collaboration, and inclusivity are the things we value most at Raccoons. We get energized when exploring new technologies, when people get behind the wheel and take action, and when the whole team works together to get the best results possible.

Is it all work at Raccoons, or also play?


>


All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and ""being dull"" is the last thing we want to be. So, of course, we make time to have fun and strengthen our team atmosphere in teambuilding and afterwork activities. Each month, we have a drink 'n sync where our team comes together for some drinks and to catch up; we regularly have diverse teambuildings; and each year, we go on an amazing teamweekend (video proof above!).

Tell us your digital needs

We’d love to hear about your challenges, dreams, vision. Let’s have a conversation and look at what’s next.

Job Description

U.S. ASSOCIATE

Company Description

 

L.E.K. Consulting is one of the premier strategy consulting firms worldwide. At L.E.K., we are passionate about helping our clients succeed with breakthrough insights that drive real impact. Our clients view us as trusted partners that help address their most pressing challenges and biggest opportunities. 

We bring together the rigor of data-driven analysis with the creativity and curiosity of a collaborative team. By hiring exceptional people and fostering a culture of ownership, inclusion, and continuous learning, we develop leaders who thrive on challenge and bring energy, optimism, and drive to every engagement. Founded in 1983, L.E.K. employs more than 2,200 professionals across five continents, and is consistently recognized as one of the industry’s best firms to work for. For more information, visit .

Job Description

If you are a bright, motivated undergraduate looking to tackle some of the toughest and most interesting business problems, consider joining L.E.K. as an Associate. This position will start in August or October 2026.

 

Associates are at the heart of our client work. You’ll quickly take on meaningful responsibility and play a crucial role on each case team. From day one, you will lead research efforts, analyze data, generate insights, and help shape recommendations that make a real impact. We look for candidates who are curious, proactive problem-solvers and excited to collaborate in a fast-paced environment. A growth mindset, positive outlook and a drive to learn and lead are key to success in this role.

 

While casework varies every day, Associates’ primary responsibilities typically include:

 


Conducting primary and secondary research on clients’ markets, customers, and competitors


 


Performing rigorous analysis to drive insights and actionable recommendations


 


Collaborating with team members to communicate key findings to the client in written presentations and verbal interactions that deliver maximum impact


L.E.K. offers associates the broadest range of fast-paced, high-impact, and diverse cases for maximum learning. We are also committed to investing in your training and development and fostering excellent analytical and leadership skills to prepare you for your progression in tenure, as well as for potential future opportunities in top graduate schools or roles in industry, non-profits, start-ups, or investment firms.

 

In addition to very competitive compensation and benefits, we promote Associates to Consultant and beyond, based on demonstrated performance.

 

 

 

WHY L.E.K.?

 

The Associate role at L.E.K. is differentiated from other firms in several key ways:

 


Immediate workstream responsibility: L.E.K. Associates are expected to be integral members of the team from day 1, immediately driving mission-critical work to help solve critical challenges for our clients.


 


Breadth of experiences: While our projects span most industries and services, our focus is strategy and M&A. Associates typically work on ~6-10 projects a year, providing greater exposure across clients and strategic issues, as well as faster development of business acumen.


 


Fun, collaborative, stimulating work environment: L.E.K. teams spend substantially more time in their home office relative to teams at peer firms, and we pride ourselves on a vibrant social culture, including case team events, office parties, non-profit involvement, and much more.
International exposure: Approximately 65% of Associates gain international exposure within their first 3 years, either through projects staffed across global offices, travel to international client locations, or, if they choose, by relocating to an international office on either a temporary or a full-time basis. .


 


Upward mobility: L.E.K. is a meritocracy with an entrepreneurial culture and frequent feedback. We rapidly progress responsibility to accelerate our team’s development.


Qualifications And Experience Needed


A bachelor’s degree from a renowned school with outstanding academic achievement
Exceptional analytical and problem-solving skills
Strong verbal and written communication skills
Demonstrated leadership, initiative and ability to thrive in a team-oriented environment
Enthusiasm, resilience, and a desire to continuously learn and grow


Note: Sector specialization is assessed during the interview process and determined at the time of hire for candidates who both meet the qualifications and express a strong interest in dedicating to a specific sector. If you are particularly interested in Organization & Performance (O&P), Life Sciences (LS), or Financial Services (FS), please clearly indicate this in your cover letter.

L.E.K. Consulting offers a competitive salary and benefits package commensurate with experience. The base salary is $95,000 (USD); L.E.K. also offers a performance bonus, profit sharing, and other benefits.

Applicants for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States on a permanent basis without the need for employer sponsorship. Unfortunately, we are unable to consider candidates requiring sponsorship for visas, including but not limited to TN, H1-B, F-1, STEM OPT/CPT, or any other work authorization.

L.E.K Consulting is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

Re‑architect how humanity powers itself.

🚀 About Everstar is a venture‑backed deep‑tech startup building the first AI‑native platform to unlock commercially viable nuclear technologies and democratize a multi‑trillion‑dollar energy sector. Together we’re fusing frontier artificial intelligence with atomic engineering to bend the cost, safety, and speed curves of clean power.

The Mission

We need a Senior AI Engineer who already lives at the bleeding edge and has scar‑tissue from shipping enterprise‑scale AI into production.

You will own the R&D roadmap and lead a small, elite engineering pod to push the boundaries of:


Foundation‑model development (physics‑informed LLMs & diffusion models)
Novel algorithm design for data‑scarce, safety‑critical domains
Autonomous control agents for safety verification, manufacturing robotics, reactor operations


You will report directly to our CEO, Kevin Kong, and have the mandate—and the resources—to set Everstar’s technical direction during a once‑in‑a‑generation market inflection.

Core Requirements


10+ years total engineering experience, 5+ years architecting or leading production AI/ML systems at Fortune‑500 or hyperscale‑startup level.
Proven enterprise impact: you’ve shipped at least one mission‑critical AI product (e.g., billion‑parameter model servicing millions of daily requests, or revenue‑integral decision engine).
Deep mastery of PyTorch (or JAX/Flax), CUDA, distributed training (DDP/FSDP) and heterogeneous hardware scaling (H100s, ASICs).
Demonstrated tech‑lead/EM chops: you’ve hired, mentored, and driven roadmap execution for ≥3 engineers.
Systems thinker—able to redesign kernels or data pipelines for 10× throughput & 99.99 % uptime.
U.S. citizenship (required) and full‑time on‑site presence in NYC (no remote/relocation assistance provided).
Passion for nuclear, energy, or other safety‑critical verticals; you master domain constraints quickly.
Exceptional communicator—can brief C‑suite, investors, regulators, and junior ICs with equal clarity.


Bonus Points


Lead author on ≥2 NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR papers or prior stint at a frontier AI lab.
Track record of open‑sourcing production‑ready AI/ML infra (Triton kernels, inference compilers, Ray Serve, etc.).
Experience coupling AI/ML with finite‑element, Monte‑Carlo, or multi‑physics simulators.
Familiarity with DOE/NRC compliance or other safety‑critical software certification.


Compensation & Perks


$170K-230K base salary + competitive equity (with potential refreshers post‑Series A).
Full medical, dental, vision, pre‑tax commuter benefits.
Annual conference budget (NeurIPS, ICML, APS, ANS) + generous R&D stipend.
Empowered, mission‑driven culture where excellence is the floor, not the ceiling.

Corporate Tools is hiring a Software Automation Engineer for $55,000/year. You will be a traditional company employee. This is a full time 40 hour M-F position with company benefits in Spokane, Washington.

As a Software Automation Engineer in Spokane, WA, you will work closely with our full-stack software team to maintain our automated form submission software. This position is responsible for overseeing the parts of our software that requires constant updates and interesting challenges. We are looking for candidates proficient in JavaScript & Node.js with a strong focus on manual and automated software testing tooling. If you enjoy creating and maintaining solutions that have a huge impact on the value of your fellow employee’s lives and our customers lives, this is for you.

What’s in a title?

Here at Corporate Tools we don’t take titles very seriously. We know for recruiting purposes we need to call our jobs something, so we started with labeling and differentiating them in a fairly traditional way with “junior, mid, senior”. However, we’ve realized that was putting our employees in a box and wasn’t allowing us to uniquely identify their individual contributions, strengths and professional goals. Once you join our team the titles kinda get dropped as we expect everyone to work with everyone regardless of title or experience. We have taken the approach of evaluating candidates and employees on a “level” basis. It makes it a little easier internally to talk about growing into the next level without there being this huge chasm between what it means to be a Junior Engineer vs. a Mid Engineer. Our levels have expectations set for each one and it’s the responsibility of the manager and employee to make sure there is alignment. We do this through quarterly conversations where we discuss employee progression, if the work is challenging, and to ensure they feel fairly compensated for their work and expertise. Basically, levels gives us more flexibility to help people grow in their careers. But sure, you can post your title on LinkedIn as what makes sense to the rest of the world.

If you enjoy creating and maintaining solutions that have a huge impact on the value of your fellow employee’s lives and our customers lives, this is for you.<br><br><strong>What’s in a title?<br><br></strong>Here at Corporate Tools we don’t take titles very seriously. We know for recruiting purposes we need to call our jobs something, so we started with labeling and differentiating them in a fairly traditional way with “junior, mid, senior”. However, we’ve realized that was putting our employees in a box and wasn’t allowing us to uniquely identify their individual contributions, strengths and professional goals. Once you join our team the titles kinda get dropped as we expect everyone to work with everyone regardless of title or experience. We have taken the approach of evaluating candidates and employees on a “level” basis. It makes it a little easier internally to talk about growing into the next level without there being this huge chasm between what it means to be a Junior Engineer vs. a Mid Engineer. Our levels have expectations set for each one and it’s the responsibility of the manager and employee to make sure there is alignment. We do this through quarterly conversations where we discuss employee progression, if the work is challenging, and to ensure they feel fairly compensated for their work and expertise. Basically, levels gives us more flexibility to help people grow in their careers. But sure, you can post your title on LinkedIn as what makes sense to the rest of the world.<br><br><strong>Wage<br><br></strong>$55,000/year<br><br><strong>Benefits<br><br></strong><ul><li>100% employer-paid medical, dental and vision for employees</li><li>Annual review with raise option</li><li>22 days Paid Time Off accrued annually, and 4 holidays</li><ul><li>After 3 years, PTO increases to 29 days.

Job Description

U.S. ASSOCIATE

Company Description

 

L.E.K. Consulting is one of the premier strategy consulting firms worldwide. At L.E.K., we are passionate about helping our clients succeed with breakthrough insights that drive real impact. Our clients view us as trusted partners that help address their most pressing challenges and biggest opportunities. 

We bring together the rigor of data-driven analysis with the creativity and curiosity of a collaborative team. By hiring exceptional people and fostering a culture of ownership, inclusion, and continuous learning, we develop leaders who thrive on challenge and bring energy, optimism, and drive to every engagement. Founded in 1983, L.E.K. employs more than 2,200 professionals across five continents, and is consistently recognized as one of the industry’s best firms to work for. For more information, visit .

Job Description

If you are a bright, motivated undergraduate looking to tackle some of the toughest and most interesting business problems, consider joining L.E.K. as an Associate. This position will start in August or October 2026.

 

Associates are at the heart of our client work. You’ll quickly take on meaningful responsibility and play a crucial role on each case team. From day one, you will lead research efforts, analyze data, generate insights, and help shape recommendations that make a real impact. We look for candidates who are curious, proactive problem-solvers and excited to collaborate in a fast-paced environment. A growth mindset, positive outlook and a drive to learn and lead are key to success in this role.

 

While casework varies every day, Associates’ primary responsibilities typically include:

 


Conducting primary and secondary research on clients’ markets, customers, and competitors


 


Performing rigorous analysis to drive insights and actionable recommendations


 


Collaborating with team members to communicate key findings to the client in written presentations and verbal interactions that deliver maximum impact


L.E.K. offers associates the broadest range of fast-paced, high-impact, and diverse cases for maximum learning. We are also committed to investing in your training and development and fostering excellent analytical and leadership skills to prepare you for your progression in tenure, as well as for potential future opportunities in top graduate schools or roles in industry, non-profits, start-ups, or investment firms.

 

In addition to very competitive compensation and benefits, we promote Associates to Consultant and beyond, based on demonstrated performance.

 

 

 

WHY L.E.K.?

 

The Associate role at L.E.K. is differentiated from other firms in several key ways:

 


Immediate workstream responsibility: L.E.K. Associates are expected to be integral members of the team from day 1, immediately driving mission-critical work to help solve critical challenges for our clients.


 


Breadth of experiences: While our projects span most industries and services, our focus is strategy and M&A. Associates typically work on ~6-10 projects a year, providing greater exposure across clients and strategic issues, as well as faster development of business acumen.


 


Fun, collaborative, stimulating work environment: L.E.K. teams spend substantially more time in their home office relative to teams at peer firms, and we pride ourselves on a vibrant social culture, including case team events, office parties, non-profit involvement, and much more.
International exposure: Approximately 65% of Associates gain international exposure within their first 3 years, either through projects staffed across global offices, travel to international client locations, or, if they choose, by relocating to an international office on either a temporary or a full-time basis. .


 


Upward mobility: L.E.K. is a meritocracy with an entrepreneurial culture and frequent feedback. We rapidly progress responsibility to accelerate our team’s development.


Qualifications And Experience Needed


A bachelor’s degree from a renowned school with outstanding academic achievement
Exceptional analytical and problem-solving skills
Strong verbal and written communication skills
Demonstrated leadership, initiative and ability to thrive in a team-oriented environment
Enthusiasm, resilience, and a desire to continuously learn and grow


Note: Sector specialization is assessed during the interview process and determined at the time of hire for candidates who both meet the qualifications and express a strong interest in dedicating to a specific sector. If you are particularly interested in Organization & Performance (O&P), Life Sciences (LS), or Financial Services (FS), please clearly indicate this in your cover letter.

L.E.K. Consulting offers a competitive salary and benefits package commensurate with experience. The base salary is $95,000 (USD); L.E.K. also offers a performance bonus, profit sharing, and other benefits.

Applicants for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States on a permanent basis without the need for employer sponsorship. Unfortunately, we are unable to consider candidates requiring sponsorship for visas, including but not limited to TN, H1-B, F-1, STEM OPT/CPT, or any other work authorization.

L.E.K Consulting is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

Culture and values

We are guided by our shared values. It's not about finding people who think and act in the same way. These values help to guide our work and will continue to strengthen it.

Thoughtful

Thoughtful at Iso is about curiosity, creativity and care. It is about good people doing good, rigorous and future-making science every single day.

Brave

Brave at Iso is about fearlessness, but it’s also about initiative and integrity. The scale of the challenge demands nothing less.

Determined

Determined at Iso is the way we pursue our goal. It’s a confidence in our hypothesis, as well as the urgency and agility needed to deliver on it. Because disease won’t wait, so neither should we.

Together

Together at Iso is about connection, collaboration across fields and catalytic relationships. It’s knowing that transformation is a group project, and remembering that what we’re doing will have a real impact on real people everywhere.

Creating An Extraordinary Company

We believe that to be successful we need a team with a range of skills and talents. We're building an environment where collaboration is fundamental, learning is shared and every employee feels supported and able to thrive. We value unique experiences, knowledge, backgrounds, and perspectives, and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact.

We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Hybrid working

It’s hugely important for us to share knowledge and build strong relationships with each other, and we find it easier to do this if we spend time together in person. This is why we follow a hybrid model, and would require you to be able to come into the office 3 days a week (currently Tuesday, Wednesday, and one other day depending on which team you’re in). If you have additional needs that would prevent you from following this hybrid approach, we’d be happy to talk through these if you’re selected for an initial screening call.

Please note that when you submit an application, your data will be processed in line with our privacy policy.

Start Date: August 1, 2025
Languages: English required; French or Spanish is a plus

Our client is building machine learning solutions to transform how clinical trials are conducted. Our goal is to turn raw sensor data from smartphones into meaningful, quantifiable health measures that help clinicians assess whether a treatment is working—earlier and more accurately.
This work is aimed at improving decision-making during the earliest stages of drug development, ultimately helping pharmaceutical teams reduce R&D timelines and costs.
Looking for one or two senior-level machine learning engineers to join our team in Europe.
The Role We’re looking for senior machine learning engineers who are excited to work with real-world, high-variability sensor data and can design systems that extract meaningful clinical insights. This is a hands-on role, with significant influence on how our models are built, validated, and deployed in production.
This position is ideal for someone who has experience translating research into production-level code, and who is motivated by the opportunity to work at the intersection of machine learning, digital biomarkers, and early-stage clinical research.
Responsibilities
Develop and deploy machine learning models that process raw time-series data (e.g., from smartphone sensors) into structured, clinically relevant measures.
Apply techniques such as signal denoising, filtering, and feature extraction to improve model robustness and reliability.
Collaborate with clinical and research teams to define measurable indicators that are sensitive to changes during treatment.
Translate exploratory prototypes into production-grade systems that are well-documented, tested, and suitable for regulated environments.
Mentor and support junior ML scientists, helping shape a consistent and scalable ML approach.
Contribute to the broader vision of building tools that support more efficient and evidence-driven drug development.
Requirements
5+ years of experience developing machine learning models, ideally in time-series, sensor, or biomedical data.
Advanced proficiency in Python and experience with multiple ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn).
Strong understanding of signal processing and experience working with noisy, real-world data.
Prior experience working in or alongside regulated or research environments (e.g., pharma, medtech, clinical trials) is a strong advantage.
Experience deploying ML systems in production, ideally using tools such as Databricks and AWS.
Based in Europe.
English fluency required. French or Spanish is a plus.
Why Join Us This is an opportunity to shape the technical foundation of a platform with the potential to improve how new therapies are developed. Your work will directly support the creation of digital endpoints that could bring new levels of precision and speed to clinical research.
You’ll join a focused, mission-driven team at an early stage and contribute to building both our models and our culture.

At NetGuardians and Intix, we’re joining forces to build the future of financial crime prevention. Our unique combo of standardized data mastery and powerful AI analytics means you’ll work at the bleeding edge of fintech innovation. Think plug-and-play intelligence, smarter fraud detection, and a real impact on global trust in finance.

What You Will Do

Deliver cutting-edge data science solutions that protect banks and their customers from fraud and financial crime.


Lead analytics implementations for clients, from PoC to production.
Translate raw data into smart fraud prevention insights using Python and ML.
Collaborate with delivery and engineering teams to solve real-world problems with real-time urgency.
Build and maintain tools, models, and documentation that scale across customers.
Continuously learn and innovate — because financial crime never sits still, and neither do we.


Who You Are

You’re fluent in Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, Jupyter — the works), and you enjoy writing clean, reusable code. You’re comfortable navigating Git and CI/CD environments, and while experience in banking or fintech is a bonus, your curiosity and drive to learn matter more. You communicate clearly, ask smart questions, and thrive in collaborative settings. You're proactive, imaginative, and unafraid to challenge the status quo if it means making things better — for your team, our tech, or our clients. Proficiency in English is a must; French is a nice plus.

Who We Are

We’re NetGuardians and Intix — two fintech innovators creating a new standard in AI-powered financial crime prevention. Our global team works with leading banks across 30+ countries. We're diverse, deeply collaborative, and genuinely care about the people we protect — and the people we work with.

TetraScience is the Scientific Data and AI Cloud company. We are catalyzing the Scientific AI revolution by designing and industrializing AI-native scientific data sets, which we bring to life in a growing suite of next-gen lab data management solutions, scientific use cases, and AI-enabled outcomes.

TetraScience is the category leader in this vital new market, generating more revenue than all other companies in the aggregate. In the last year alone, the world's dominant players in compute, cloud, data, and AI infrastructure have converged on TetraScience as the de facto standard, entering into co-innovation and go-to-market partnerships: Latest News and Announcements | TetraScience Newsroom

In connection with your candidacy, you will be asked to carefully review the Tetra Way letter, authored directly by Patrick Grady, our co-founder and CEO. This letter is designed to assist you in better understanding whether TetraScience's values and ethos are the right fit for you.

It is impossible to overstate the importance of this document and you are encouraged to take it literally and reflect on whether you are aligned with our unique approach to company and team building. If you join us, you will be expected to embody its contents daily.

Requirements

Who You Are

TetraScience is hiring an elite engagement leader for key accounts in EMEA. The Engagement Director role concurrently drives activities for renewal numbers and drives overall success of implementation delivery and value realization. There is also a parallel effort to closely collaborate with Account Executives and Pre-sales TAMs to identify and land expansion opportunities.

As we rapidly evolve our platform and open up new value creation paths with new SKUs and new personas, we require an uncompromising and results-driven engagement leader to help us deliver scientific and operational value as well as expand within our customer base.

You are a customer centric and see-around-the-corner individual with a passion for delivering value while navigating customer hierarchy within the high-inertia Life Sciences industry.

You will need to fundamentally embody the principles of extreme ownership and have a demonstrated history of building and leading high-performing delivery or engagement teams.

You will have demonstrable experience in managing critical activities of your delivery teams and proof of consistently delivering complex data solutions in challenging scenarios. You are a top-tier communicator and able to tell compelling stories in difficult situations. You will be a forward-deployed captain to ensure customer success no matter the obstacles or friction the team encounters.

For the avoidance of doubt, we remain in the category creation and evangelism phase and thus you are not coming in to follow a strict playbook or be a siloed people manager. It will require extreme self-discipline and determination as we forge a category that will fundamentally and forever change the life sciences industry.

What You Have Done


7+ years in delivery leadership roles within the Life Sciences software and data market with expertise in at least two of the following three areas: Discovery/Early-Stage Development, Late-Stage Development/CMC, Manufacturing/QC
3+ years in management consulting
Worked in startup environments
Led teams to successfully deploy solutions in the top 250 bio/pharma cohort (not biotech alone)
Delivered complex enterprise deals - $ hundreds of thousands to millions in ARR per deal
Expanded customer land deals - $ hundreds of thousands to millions in ACV
Evidenced strong program leadership skills while navigating difficult periods with your delivery team(s)
Delivered solutions within GxP-compliant areas
Coached and mentored Engagement, Project, Program and/or Customer Success Managers who went on to do their best work due to your assistance
Operated effectively in a fast-paced, team environment


What You Will Do


Execute a comprehensive delivery motion to drive faster time-to-value with high customer satisfaction and meet annual renewal targets
Lead key account delivery teams consisting of project managers, scientific data architects, scientific business analysts and data engineers, aligning on clear targets and objectives to ensure team success
Leverage and coordinate cross-functional teams, when necessary (Legal, Engineering, Marketing, Product), to efficiently coordinate complex implementations and product deployments
Collaborate with Sales leadership and Account Executives to pursue new business opportunities within existing accounts during implementation and in the absence of an active delivery motion
Gain a deep and broad understanding of TetraScience's Product, enabling you to evangelize and explain it to customer teams in a way each persona will comprehend
Work closely with product teams to bring customer enhancement requests to fruition and deliver more value and maintain customer awareness of relevant Product roadmap details
Stay up-to-date on industry trends and emerging technologies, positioning TetraScience as a thought leader in the market
Collaborate with Account Executives to create and execute account-specific plans in order to meet expansion goals and support the renewal strategy
Maintain ongoing relationships with existing customers, ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction and retention while expanding your network within the accounts
Manage renewal forecasts and account health providing regular updates to leadership on progress toward targets of your accounts
Lead by example and inspire your delivery teams to do the best work of their life
Employ analytical and EQ skills to generate insights from customers' data strategies and actions, respectively

About Us

From the centre of the continent to the remote (and not-so-remote) coasts and islands, KFC Pan Europe is the iconic chicken restaurant brand with a unique history of innovation and success. Always original, our passion is high-quality, finger lickin’ good chicken. Yes, we also have a secret recipe. No, we can’t share it.

We’re part of Yum! Brands, Inc.—collaborating across the world with our sister brands, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and The Habit Burger Grill. KFC Pan Europe has three business units: Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe and France. With more than 30 official languages in 150 different franchises, connecting with us is easier than ever. If you really want to do the math, we’ve also got 2,200 restaurants in 40 countries. Either way, we keep it original.

For us, the future is all about connecting food traditions and tomorrow’s technology to innovate customer experiences, our global brand and the best fried chicken you’ve ever tasted. We exist to feed people’s potential, valuing personal development and an inclusive culture. This also means having a keen social purpose and investing in mentorship, upskilling and food security. Creating opportunities for the most underserved and vulnerable groups in our communities helps grow new roots and strengthen bonds.

We want our people to be their best selves. So, we invest in skills, resources and each other. At our Pan Europe Academy, we develop leadership and train all levels of restaurant and corporate employees. From Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to Individual Development Plans, we build meaningful careers that have real impact.

The bottom line? We bring it. Curious? We hope so.

Bring your spark, your spice and your original story. At KFC Pan Europe, we’re grounded in winning, celebrating, recognizing, welcoming and belonging. We've got a big table. You have a seat at it.
