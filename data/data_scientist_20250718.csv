We are looking for our first Data Scientist to lead data science efforts across autonomy, safety, and product. As the lead you will help set the foundation for how data science is done at Bedrock, you'll deliver the most critical insights across many domains, and you'll define the future growth of the team.

We're looking for a data scientist who is adept at working with infrastructure and data engineering teams, has experience with complex data similar to autonomy, robotics, or complex ad-tech use cases. We're also looking for someone who has experience in fast growing companies and startups.

If you think this describes you, in whole or in part, we'd love to talk to you about joining us to be our first data scientist.

Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

We strive to create an environment where employees from all backgrounds are respected. We also offer:


Competitive healthcare benefits
Generous equity compensation
Unlimited vacation
Membership in the First Round Network (a curated and confidential community with events, guides, thousands of Q&A questions, and opportunities for 1-1 mentorship)


At Pomelo, we are committed to hiring the best team to improve outcomes for all mothers and babies, regardless of their background. We need diverse perspectives to reflect the diversity of problems we face and the population we serve. We look to hire people from a variety of backgrounds, including but not limited to race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, national origin, religion, disability, and veteran status.

Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our company’s size and industry, and are one part of the total compensation package that also includes equity, benefits, and other opportunities at Pomelo Care. In accordance with New York City, Colorado, California, and other applicable laws, Pomelo Care is required to provide a reasonable estimate of the compensation range for this role. Individual pay decisions are ultimately based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, geography, and balancing internal equity. Given that this role is open to candidates of different skill levels, determining a salary range is challenging. A reasonable estimate of the current salary range is $120,000 to $190,000. We expect most candidates to fall in the middle of the range. We also believe that your personal needs and preferences should be taken into consideration, so we allow some choice between equity and cash.

Potential Fraud Warning

Please be cautious of potential recruitment fraud. With the increase of remote work and digital hiring, phishing and job scams are on the rise with malicious actors impersonating real employees and sending fake job offers in an effort to collect personal or financial information.

Pomelo Care will never ask you to pay a fee or download software as part of the interview process with our company. Pomelo Care will also never ask for your personal banking or other financial information until after you have signed an offer of employment and completed onboarding paperwork that is provided by our People Operations team. All official communication with Pomelo Care People Operations team will come from domain email addresses ending in @pomelocare.com.

If you receive a message that seems suspicious, we encourage you to pause communication and contact us directly at careers@pomelocare.com to confirm its legitimacy. For your safety, we also recommend applying only through our official Careers page. If you believe you have been the victim of a scam or identity theft, please contact your local law enforcement agency or another trusted authority for guidance.

As part of the Shopping Data Science team, you will be an integral partner to the broader Zillow Growth & Shopping Product Data Science team (GSDS). The GSDS team is an impactful ensemble of multiple key business functions, including User growth, Integrated Communications, Property search and evaluation, and Onsite Testing that acquire and engage millions of users across our platforms.

The GSDS team is tasked with organizing, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets from various sources to help advise both short and long-term decision-making. Our structure is very flat, and you will soon find yourself working directly with Senior Leadership.

About The Role

You will analyze how customers interact with our several platforms to find their next home, using these insights to advise design and product development. You will provide thought leadership in crafting an outstanding shopping experience for Zillow users, playing a pivotal role in developing the long-term vision of our product ecosystem. You will have frequent opportunities to share your analyses and recommendations with colleagues across the organization and see the results of your efforts affect millions of people. In this role, you will:


Partner with product & engineering to help craft a long-term customer strategy.
Use sophisticated analytics, including clustering, propensity modeling, and causal inference techniques to gain a clearer picture of customer behavior.
Build compelling data stories and visualizations to influence decision-makers.
Design, analyze, and interpret A/B experiments with statistical precision.
Identify and track business-critical metrics; analyze, measure, and report levers that help move them.
Collaborate with fellow Data Scientists to build and improve the DS infrastructure (ETLs, dashboards, experimentation platform, tracking, etc.)


This role has been categorized as a teleworker position. Teleworkers do not have a permanent corporate office workplace and, instead, work from a physical location of their choice which must be identified to the Company. Employees may live in any part of Mexico, but preferably in Mexico City, as we would encourage attendance for occasional in-office events.

In addition to a competitive base salary and benefits, this position is also eligible for equity awards based on factors such as experience, performance and location.

Who you are

We are looking for someone passionate about experimentation, translating complicated data sets and business problems into easily consumable and impactful insights. You will also need to be unafraid of tackling complexity and new business problems. We're searching for a Data Scientist who has:


An undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g. mathematics, engineering, statistics, finance, analytics or similar)
3+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis, data science, complex problem solving. Prior experience in product analytics is a plus!
3+ years of experience implementing a variety of measurement methods across modeling and testing for various marketing use cases
3+ years or more of experience as a data scientist experience querying multi-terabyte-sized noisy data sets such as clickstream data.
A strong understanding of statistical concepts, A/B testing, measurement methods, and causal inference techniques as it relates to the marketing space.
Mastery of SQL, and either Python or R.
Experience in modeling techniques like time series forecasting, logistic regression or more complex modeling approaches (like xgboost, random forest)
Ability to work cross-functionally and strong written, verbal, and visual communication skills.

What’s more meaningful than seeing the real-world impact of your work?




Ok, maybe ending world hunger, but this is a strong second.

At OOONO, you’re not just building models in a notebook. You’re shaping the algorithms that directly power a physical product - used in real time by real people in the real world.

Join a small, collaborative team where you’re trusted to take ownership, test bold ideas, and push things into production. You’ll work hands-on with rich geospatial data to make our location logic smarter and faster.

And you’ll do it side by side with engineers, hardware specialists, and designers who genuinely care - about the product, the users, and each other.

What you’ll be doing

Develop and improve core algorithms to enhance product performance and user experience.
Contribute to map matching logic and road network analysis to improve location accuracy
Design, build, and maintain predictive models to solve complex business challenges.
Analyze large-scale data sets from Athena, MongoDB, and other sources to extract actionable insights.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Software, Hardware, UX/UI) to implement data-driven solutions.
Experiment with cutting-edge geospatial tools and frameworks to continuously improve analytical workflows.
Handle location data and geo spatial field.




We imagine you’re someone who has

A master’s degree in data science, geoinformatics or similar field
Proven experience (3+ years) in a Data Science role or similar, ideally within a tech environment and working with geospatial data
Proficiency in Python, including libraries such as Polars, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, Pyproj, Folium, Osmnx
Knowledge of geospatial analysis techniques (e.g., spatial joins, indexing, projections).
Strong understanding of statistical analysis, machine learning, and algorithm development.
Solid problem-solving skills and ability to work independently when needed
Hands-on person that can drive processes from A to B independently
English is a requirement.
Self-driven




How is it working at OOONO?

We’re glad we asked. It’s a nice working place. As in nice-nice. We have a relaxed, informal atmosphere and a flat hierarchy. Whenever you need a break from your important work stuff, you can get beat in table tennis, foosball, or just smalltalk about the weather by the coffee machine. We have monthly social events where we do anything from go-karting to going to festivals.

And when we’re not social? Then we’re pretty damn ambitious. We don’t like conservative targets or linear growth. We’re all about the extraordinary. This has led OOONO to become one of the fastest-growing tech scaleups and surprise-surprise: We have no plans of slowing down. So yes, OOONO is a lovely place to work, but it’s also a pretty good opportunity to develop as a person and take the next steps in your career.




The practical stuff

Start date: ASAP
Send your motivated CV to job@ooono.dk
Working hours: Full-time (37 hours)
Location: Gearhalsvej 1.1, 2500 Valby

Our Copenhagen office mirrors our innovative technology – with an indoor ball court, rooftop terrace, and well-equipped gym. We have created a facility that supports connecting disciplines across the business, facilitates creative thinking, and gives the space to engage with colleagues, our global partners, and the entire Veo community.

Diversity and differences are valuable assets for us. We value diversity and inclusion and welcome people from all backgrounds. If you’re excited about this role but your experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Values We Hold at Veo:

Dare - We take initiative, stay curious, and challenge the status quo in our work.

Own it - We drive impact by identifying opportunities, taking responsibility, and confidently executing.

We’re hiring a Machine Learning Research Engineer to join a small, world-class team building cutting-edge ML solutions from first principles. This is not your average ""data science"" role. You will design, train, and implement machine learning models—end-to-end—and your ability to think deeply, work independently, and deliver real solutions will define your success.




The Company

Is a young, ambitious company working on highly complex challenges in one of the most critical sectors of the modern economy. They are outcompeting the market, delivering extraordinary results just after launching in the market. The team is highly recognized from the university / R&D industry and counts more names coming from world-leading organizations. Their mission is grounded in data, driven by research, and guided by impact. They operate on trust, rigor, and a shared desire to do meaningful, lasting work. Everyone writes code. Everyone solves real problems.




Job Scope

Develop, train, and implement ML/DL models from scratch
Own the full research-to-production pipeline (not just notebooks)
Solve new, complex problems using the best tools for the job—no legacy baggage
Think creatively about architecture, optimization, evaluation, and deployment
Collaborate with a small, highly competent team with diverse academic and industry backgrounds
Operate independently and take ownership of real-world systems from day one




Ideal Candidate

PhD or equivalent research-level experience in ML, physics, mathematics, or similar
Publications in respected journals/conferences
Deep theoretical knowledge in statistics, mathematics, and machine learning
Hands-on experience training and evaluating custom models (not just using libraries)
Strong programming skills in Python and familiarity with ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.)
Comfortable navigating uncertainty, open-ended problems, and full-stack ML systems
Fluent in English
Willing to work onsite (no remote)




What Success Looks Like

3 months: You’ve taken ownership of key technical challenges and shipped your first contributions
6 months: You’re solving hard problems that didn’t have obvious solutions
12 months: You’re a core part of the technical foundation—and helping define where we go next




What We Offer

Competitive salary—based on ability, not title
High-trust environment with extreme autonomy
Work that matters: technically, societally, and environmentally
A team of real experts who love what they do
No bureaucratic layers—just impact




Ready to build something meaningful?

Jobbet

Vores kunder har store datasæt, komplekse problemstillinger og sammen skal vi omsætte de analytiske resultater til konkrete anbefalinger. En del af den tekniske udfordring er, at datamængderne konstant vokser og bliver stadig mere komplekse. Du skal være med til at løse denne udfordring. Sammen med en data scientist skal du på professionel vis håndtere kundens data, levere rådgivning og præsentere anbefalinger, som optimerer kundens investeringer baseret på et solidt analytisk grundlag.

Din daglige rutine som studentermedhjælper vil hovedsageligt være at opdatere, automatisere og klargøre data til analyser, samt opsætte indledende resultater i PowerPoint og PowerBI, alt imens du opbygger solid viden om branchen og de anvendte metoder.

Faglige og personlige kvalifikationer

Du er blandt årgangens skarpeste inden for økonomi, matematisk optimering, databehandling, statistik og/eller økonometri. Efter et introduktionsforløb, hvor du bliver fortrolig med vores anvendte datakilder og systemer, vil du selvstændigt arbejde med databehandlingen og udarbejdelse af præsentationer – i takt med, at du stifter bekendtskab med branchen, vil du få muligheden for at bistå i rådgivningen til virksomhederne og derved udvikle dine færdigheder som konsulent.

Vi forestiller os, at du:


Er i gang med en uddannelse, der giver et solidt fundament inden for økonomi og statistik
Har arbejdet med Microsoft Office-pakken (særligt PowerPoint og Excel), har kendskab til programmeringssprog som Python, og enten har erfaring med - eller interesse for - at arbejde med cloud-løsninger som Google BigQuery og SQL-baserede databaser
Er grundig, trives med at arbejde selvstændigt, og er god til at overholde deadlines
Har en vis forståelse for statistisk programmering og evt. dashboardløsninger


Vi tilbyder

Et fagligt udfordrende studiejob på ca. 15-20 timer om ugen i et engageret og dynamisk team med mere end 60 dygtige kollegaer fra hele Norden. Vi er en social gruppe, der holder af at tilbringe tid sammen uden for arbejdstiden blandt andet med padel, funktionel træning, karaoke, i fredagsbaren samt ture til udlandet, hvor vi til oktober planlægger en tur til Budapest.

Vi har højt til loftet og forventer at vores medarbejdere arbejder selvstændigt og er proaktive. Det er vores klare ambition, at du efter at have færdiggjort din uddannelse har mulighed for og lyst til at blive en del af vores organisation som fastansat.

Vores kontor ligger på Holmbladsgade 133, bag Kløvermarken på Amager, i gåafstand til Lergravsparken Metro. Vi har en fremragende kantine, hvor vi også tilbyder morgenmad, samt en masse sociale arrangementer i løbet af året, attraktive personalegoder og meget mere.

We’re delighted to be working with one of Europe’s most exciting tech startups, as they continue their mission to become the leader in their market.




They’re looking to onboard an experienced backend engineer, to join one of their internal teams.




The Role




In this role, you'll be working as part of the Business Ops team - which focuses on internal processes, developer tools & creating the best possible work environment for both technical & non-technical team members.




You'll work closely with a team of engineers as well as non-technical stakeholders, before crafting innovative solutions to every day problems.




You'll be using Python, with Django being used as their main framework. Whilst this specific role is purely backend focused, they do have space for a Full Stack Engineer in the near future - so don't hesitate to reach out if you have solid TypeScript experience too.




What You’ll Bring




5+ years of commercial software engineering experience
3+ years of experience working with Python
Demonstratable experience of working with internal teams with non-technical staff
Any experience in TypeScript is a plus, but certainly not required




The Company




With a current team of over 400 and huge growth planned in the next few years, this is an opportunity to get in while the rocket ship’s still near the launchpad.




Their tech is used by tens of thousands of teams across the globe every week—helping analysts record, analyse, and improve performance with ease.




The company’s mission is a positive and inclusive one: to ensure access to performance tools, regardless of background, budget, or location.




Their Copenhagen HQ is the coolest office I’ve ever visited, so I’m sure you’ll agree. Most of their team are onsite between 3-5 days a week. They offer flexibility on remote working, but their staff like being in the office more often than not.

Vi er en energikoncern der leverer vand og fjernvarme i trekantområdet samt el, bredbånd og ladeløsninger til kunder i hele Danmark. Vi har inden for de seneste år udskiftet alle vores digitale kundevendte platforme, og har nu en stærk digital tilstedeværelse med vores hjemmeside, flere selvbetjeningsløsninger, mobilapps og en marketing automation platform. Platformene er integrerede med hinanden og bygget på en moderne og prisbelønnet integrationsplatform, hvor data er gjort tilgængelige via microservices.

I Digitale Kundeplatforme drifter og videreudvikler vi platformene i tæt samarbejde med andre forretningsområder og vores eget tilknyttede IT-udviklingsteam. Vi er allerede i gang med at implementere databaserede løsninger, som en del af vores digitale kundeoplevelser, og ønsker nu at tage næste skridt og sætte fart på udviklingen.

Om rollen

Du bliver teamets specialist i machine learning og AI og får ansvar for at udvikle, teste og implementere modeller, der udgør det datamæssige fundament for nye digitale løsninger og services til vores kunder.

Du kommer til at arbejde hands-on med modellering, databehandling og kode – i tæt samspil med relevante afdelinger såsom IT-infrastruktur, Data Warehouse og Data Governance. Derudover vil du arbejde sammen med dine kollegaer i teamet, der arbejder med app, web, selvbetjening og marketing automation, om at integrere modellerne direkte i vores digitale platforme og løsninger, så de skaber reel værdi for vores kunder.

Hos EWII arbejder andre data scientists med forskellige formål på tværs af organisationen, og vi har allerede et stærkt teknologi- og datasetup på plads. I denne rolle får du ansvar for at udvikle modeller baseret på kundernes forbrugs- og adfærdsdata – kombineret med relevante tredjepartsdata såsom vejr- og boligdata.

Eksempler på arbejdsopgaver



Udvikling og optimering af prædiktive og præskriptive modeller, som danner udgangspunkt for vores automatiserede kommunikation
Udvikling og optimering af forbrugsalarmer baseret på machine learning og anomalidetektion, som automatisk kan opdage, hvis den enkelte kundes forbrug afviger fra deres normalforbrug
Udvikling af personaliserede forbrugsrapporter baseret på dataanalyse og integreret med generativt AI, som genererer individuelle rapporter med grafer og forklarende tekst.
Udforske nye teknologier og eksperimentere med ML- og AI-baserede løsninger på tværs af platformene.



Det tilbyder vi 

Som medarbejder i EWII er det ikke kun dit arbejde, der er i centrum - du får også mange personalegoder, der er værd at arbejde for. Hvilke goder, du kan nyde godt af, kan du blive klogere på her. 

Din profil

Vi forestiller os, at du har en uddannelse inden for datalogi, machine learning, statistik eller lignende – fx cand.scient., cand.polyt. eller cand.it med specialisering i data science. Du har allerede nogen erfaring, og har et ønske om at arbejde tættere sammen med forretningen om dine modeller.

Vi lægger vægt på, at du:



Har praktisk erfaring med dataanalyse, statistisk modellering og machine learning i cloud-baserede miljøer, herunder udvikling af prædiktive og preskriptive modeller på Azure Databricks-platformen.
Har stærke kompetencer inden for Python og SQL.

Hos Krifa bliver du som Data Scientist en del af et ambitiøst og tværfagligt team, der fungerer som interne specialister / konsulenter i udviklingen af AI-løsninger med konkret værdi for vores medlemmer og forretning. Vi tror på, at de bedste resultater skabes i tæt samarbejde med forretningen, hvor forskellige kompetencer bringes i spil.







Vi søger 1-2 nye kolleger til at styrke vores tekniske fundament. Som supplement til dine primære kvalifikationer som data scientist, ser vi gerne, at du i tillæg har erfaring inden for ét af to specifikke områder:

Cloud & MLOps/DevOps: Du er en Data Scientist, der brænder for at bygge robuste og skalerbare systemer. Du bygger bro mellem modeludvikling og implementering ved at designe og automatisere de pipelines, der sikrer, at vores løsninger kan leveres effektivt.
Data Engineering: Du er en Data Scientist, der motiveres af at skabe orden og bygge det solide datafundament, som al god AI hviler på. Du trives med at designe datamodeller og etablere effektive data-pipelines af høj kvalitet til hvert enkelt projekt.




Det afgørende er ikke en rigid rollefordeling, men at vi som team deler en passion for at løfte opgaverne i flok og tilsammen dækker de nødvendige kompetencer.







Dine arbejdsopgaver i teamet

Du bliver en del af et team, hvor alle bidrager på tværs af værdikæden. Sammen arbejder vi med:

Data Science & AI Engineering: At omsætte både strukturerede og ustrukturerede data til indsigter. Dette indebærer analyse af komplekse datasæt og udvikling af machine learning-modeller inden for alt fra predictive analytics til NLP samt udvikling af AI agenter, RAG, MCP-servere mm.
Automatisering af processer: At identificere og automatisere forretningsprocesser og manuelle arbejdsgange med data og AI for at skabe effektivitet og frigøre tid i organisationen.
Datafundament og Engineering: At bygge og vedligeholde det datagrundlag, vores løsninger kører på. Her bliver dine kompetencer inden for Data Engineering afgørende for vores succes med at designe datamodeller, bygge ETL/ELT-pipelines og sikre høj datakvalitet.
Operationalisering (MLOps/DevOps): At sikre, at vores modeller kan udrulles og integreres effektivt i Krifas systemer. Med din erfaring inden for MLOps/DevOps styrker du teamets evne til at bygge CI/CD-pipelines til deployment, automatisere monitorering og designe en skalerbar cloud-infrastruktur (f.eks. Azure) til vores løsninger.
Arkitektur og Samarbejde: At bidrage til den overordnede tekniske arkitektur i tæt sparring med resten af teamet, så vi træffer bæredygtige teknologivalg for fremtiden.







Hvem er du?

Du har stærke analytiske evner og en teknisk profil, som du formår at omsætte til konkrete løsninger. Du er nysgerrig, proaktiv og trives i et miljø, hvor der er fokus på både innovation og leverancen af robuste løsninger. Frem for alt har du lyst til at være med til at forme fremtidens AI-løsninger i Krifa som en del af et passioneret team.







Vi forestiller os, at du har:

Solid praktisk erfaring med AI, LLM'er og ML, gerne med både strukturerede data og ustrukturerede data.
Stærke programmeringskompetencer i Python, da det er vores primære sprog for data science.
Erfaring med enten Data Engineering (ETL, databaser, data lakes / lakehouses som f.eks. Microsoft Fabric eller Databricks) eller Cloud & DevOps (Azure/AWS/GCP, CI/CD, IaC). Du behøver ikke være ekspert i begge dele.
Evnen til at samarbejde med både tekniske og ikke-tekniske kolleger og omsætte data til forretningsværdi.
Flydende dansk er et krav – både mundtligt og skriftligt







Om Krifa

Du bliver en del af en moderne arbejdslivsbevægelse med mere end 185.000 medlemmer. Krifa er kåret som Danmarks bedste a-kasse de seneste tre år, og vores medlemmer oplever, at de bliver mødt med empati og forståelse.

Vi er en energikoncern der leverer vand og fjernvarme i trekantområdet samt el, bredbånd og ladeløsninger til kunder i hele Danmark. Vi har inden for de seneste år udskiftet alle vores digitale kundevendte platforme, og har nu en stærk digital tilstedeværelse med vores hjemmeside, flere selvbetjeningsløsninger, mobilapps og en marketing automation platform. Platformene er integrerede med hinanden og bygget på en moderne og prisbelønnet integrationsplatform, hvor data er gjort tilgængelige via microservices.

I Digitale Kundeplatforme drifter og videreudvikler vi platformene i tæt samarbejde med andre forretningsområder og vores eget tilknyttede IT-udviklingsteam. Vi er allerede i gang med at implementere databaserede løsninger, som en del af vores digitale kundeoplevelser, og ønsker nu at tage næste skridt og sætte fart på udviklingen.

Om rollen

Du bliver teamets specialist i machine learning og AI og får ansvar for at udvikle, teste og implementere modeller, der udgør det datamæssige fundament for nye digitale løsninger og services til vores kunder.

Du kommer til at arbejde hands-on med modellering, databehandling og kode – i tæt samspil med relevante afdelinger såsom IT-infrastruktur, Data Warehouse og Data Governance. Derudover vil du arbejde sammen med dine kollegaer i teamet, der arbejder med app, web, selvbetjening og marketing automation, om at integrere modellerne direkte i vores digitale platforme og løsninger, så de skaber reel værdi for vores kunder.

Hos EWII arbejder andre data scientists med forskellige formål på tværs af organisationen, og vi har allerede et stærkt teknologi- og datasetup på plads. I denne rolle får du ansvar for at udvikle modeller baseret på kundernes forbrugs- og adfærdsdata – kombineret med relevante tredjepartsdata såsom vejr- og boligdata.

Eksempler på arbejdsopgaver



Udvikling og optimering af prædiktive og præskriptive modeller, som danner udgangspunkt for vores automatiserede kommunikation
Udvikling og optimering af forbrugsalarmer baseret på machine learning og anomalidetektion, som automatisk kan opdage, hvis den enkelte kundes forbrug afviger fra deres normalforbrug
Udvikling af personaliserede forbrugsrapporter baseret på dataanalyse og integreret med generativt AI, som genererer individuelle rapporter med grafer og forklarende tekst.
Udforske nye teknologier og eksperimentere med ML- og AI-baserede løsninger på tværs af platformene.



Det tilbyder vi 

Som medarbejder i EWII er det ikke kun dit arbejde, der er i centrum - du får også mange personalegoder, der er værd at arbejde for. Hvilke goder, du kan nyde godt af, kan du blive klogere på her. 

Din profil

Vi forestiller os, at du har en uddannelse inden for datalogi, machine learning, statistik eller lignende – fx cand.scient., cand.polyt. eller cand.it med specialisering i data science. Du har allerede nogen erfaring, og har et ønske om at arbejde tættere sammen med forretningen om dine modeller.

Vi lægger vægt på, at du:



Har praktisk erfaring med dataanalyse, statistisk modellering og machine learning i cloud-baserede miljøer, herunder udvikling af prædiktive og preskriptive modeller på Azure Databricks-platformen.
Har stærke kompetencer inden for Python og SQL.
Forstår, hvordan modeller omsættes til værdi i en digital forretningskontekst og gerne i forbindelse med digitale kundevendte platforme.
Trives i krydsfeltet mellem teknik og forretning og kan forklare komplekse modeller og resultater til ikke-tekniske kollegaer
Er nysgerrig, forretningsorienteret og trives med et stort selvstændigt ansvar for dit ansvarsområde, men sætter pris på at arbejde teamorienteret mod vores fælles vision og mål.



I rollen får du



En central rolle i et ambitiøst digitalt team med stærkt mandat og stor indflydelse.
Frihed til at eksperimentere og udvikle dine egne idéer til ML- og AI-baserede kundeløsninger
Samarbejde med kollegaer, der arbejder med digital performance, UX, app- og webudvikling, marketing automation og dataplatforme
Adgang til en moderne teknologistak samtidig med, at du bliver en del af en virksomhed med strategisk fokus på digital innovation.



Sæt et grønt fodspor sammen med os 

I EWII er hverdagen vidt forskellig for vores 700 medarbejdere. Men fælles for alle er, at fagligheden når helt ud i fingerspidserne – og den skal male fremtiden grøn. 

I EWIIs kommercielle afdelinger kridter vi kondiskoene hver dag – uanset om vi lægger arm med energimarkedet, digitaliserer forretningen eller flytter danskerne over på fiber. Sammen gør vi det, der er sort til grøn business – til gavn for miljø, kunder og bundlinje. 

Er du vores nye kollega?

Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig. Du sender sit CV og motiverede ansøgning ved at klikke på ansøgningsknappen. Hos os er diversitet og forskellighed en styrke, og derfor er alle ansøgninger velkomne uanset køn, alder, etnicitet, civilstand etc.

Har du lyst til at bruge dine eftermiddage i selskab med en nysgerrig 10-årig dreng, der elsker Pokémon, computere og at gå på jagt efter edderkopper i haven?

Om opgaven

Vi søger en tålmodig og nærværende støtteperson, der kan være en fast og tryg voksen i hjemmet for en dreng diagnosticeret med autisme og ADHD. Han har brug for ro, genkendelighed og en voksen, som møder ham i hans interesser og dagsform.

Din primære opgave er at tage imod ham, når han kommer hjem med skolebussen, og være sammen med ham, indtil en forælder kommer hjem. Samværet tager udgangspunkt i det, han har lyst til – hvad end det er at spille på computeren, kigge på Pokémonkort, se Netflix eller udforske haven og finde edderkopper. Det vigtigste er, at du møder ham med anerkendelse og støtte, så han føler sig tryg og bekræftet i det, han gør.

Han er god til at tale med nye mennesker, men kan også opleve udfordringer i sociale relationer, og det er derfor vigtigt, at du er en rolig og tålmodig tilstedeværelse, der kan aflæse og tilpasse dig hans behov.

Om dig

Du har erfaring med autisme og ADHD – enten gennem fagligt arbejde eller personlig erfaring. Du er stabil, tålmodig og god til at skabe struktur. Du forstår vigtigheden af at møde barnet, hvor han er, og kan skabe ro og nærvær i hjemmets rammer.

ZOE is the science and nutrition company leading a movement to transform the health of millions.

We exist because the food we eat is making us sick. Most of what we are taught about food is wrong.

ZOE runs the world’s largest nutrition science study to find scientifically proven solutions.

Our randomised controlled trial of ZOE proves that if you eat the right food for your body, you can feel healthier in weeks and be on track for more healthy years.

ZOE can change the way you eat, feel, and live. We host world-leading scientists on our podcast and bring proven science to your plate with Daily30+, our 30+ plant supplement.

Over 100,000 people rely on ZOE Membership, our personalised nutrition program, to make smarter food choices. ZOE Membership turns complex science into clear step-by-step actions, helping you improve your health with every meal.

ZOE means life — and you can change your life with food.

Visit our career page and become a ZOEntist 🚀

🚀 The Role

As a Data Scientist at ZOE, you will partner with world-class nutrition scientists to turn cutting-edge research into robust scoring algorithms and science-driven features, and to build ML/AI models that leverage our extensive members’ data to improve user experience and health outcomes.

This role is perfect for someone passionate about nutrition, health tech, or biology, or someone with the curiosity and drive to dive in and learn quickly.

Unlike a classical “fit-the-model” data science role, you’ll also engineer bespoke models that embed expert knowledge, validate them rigorously on real-world data, and ship production-ready code that powers the ZOE experience. You’ll collaborate daily with scientists, engineers, and product teams—moving fast and iterating quickly based on strong but not perfect evidence (:70 %) because speed beats perfection in a startup.

👥 The Team

You’ll be joining the Data Science team at Zoe. The team spends most of its time embedded in stream-aligned product teams while regularly setting aside a smaller portion of its schedule to drive high-impact, cross-cutting data science initiatives for the wider organisation.

Your home base will be the Scoring team—a cross-functional team of product managers, engineers, scientists, and data scientists that sits at the nexus of research and product. You’ll join a squad that prizes intellectual honesty, rapid experimentation, and our #ActFast ethos—working hand-in-hand with PhD scientists to turn hypotheses into deployed models.

🎯 What You’ll Be Doing


Design, iterate, and deploy scoring algorithms for foods, diets, metabolic responses, and microbiome profiles.
Translate expert food statements (e.g., ‘High-glycaemic foods raise blood glucose responses’) into model features and Python functions.
Build, test, and maintain clean, production-ready code in Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), and SQL/DBT/BigQuery/Airflow.
Build ML/AI models to improve food coverage and categorisation, ingredients extraction, food recommendations, and more.
Design validation frameworks that blend scientific rigour (e.g., hold-out tests, bootstrapping, sensitivity analyses) with pragmatic speed.
Partner with engineers to shape data contracts and ensure pipelines deliver the granularity, latency, and quality your models require.
Present results using decks, dashboards, or Looms to support data-driven product decisions.
Take full ownership of your work, brining entrepreneurial spirit and work proactively.
Champion our scientific yet agile approach: start with a hypothesis, seek evidence, and iterate fast.



🧠 What You’ll Bring To The Table


3+ years of professional experience in data science, ML engineering, or quantitative research.
A degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Applied Maths, Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Statistics, Computer Science).
Solid grasp of machine learning (e.g. training and evaluating standard models) and statistical techniques (e.g. running hypothesis testing).
Experienced in contributing to production-level Python codebases, developing new components and features, writing moderately complex SQL queries, and using Git for version control.
Experience turning domain knowledge (rules, heuristics, scientific findings) into engineered model logic.
A track record of shipping production code and collaborating in cross-functional, fast-paced environments.
Comfort using AI tools to enhance day-to-day productivity—from IDEs with AI assistants to prompt engineering.
Strong communication and collaboration skills—from delivering clear presentations to stakeholders to conducting deep-dive code reviews and working collaboratively across functions.
Must have a passion for nutrition, health tech, biology, or a strong desire to dive in and learn quickly.
A commitment to our #ActFast value: optimise for reversible decisions, take smart risks, and move quickly with imperfect data.



🌟 Bonus Points


Experience with causal inference and advanced statistical modelling.
Experience with building AI features using LLMs and evaluation frameworks.
Exposure to MLOps best practices.
Knowledge of microbiome data, ---omics pipelines, or biomarker analytics.

🎉 Offer



If everything clicks, we’ll move to offer quickly and transparently. You'll always know where you stand and what comes next.

The experience, skills, and attributes listed above reflect what we believe will contribute to success in this role. If you're passionate about ZOE and the opportunity, but don't meet 100% of the criteria, we still encourage you to apply. We are committed to supporting growth and are happy to offer up-skilling opportunities where possible.

Remote Philosophy

ZOE is a remote-first company, meaning remote work isn’t just an option — it’s how we work best. We are intentional about building a distributed, high-performing team where collaboration, trust, and flexibility thrive.

We design our workflows around asynchronous communication and shared documentation to support autonomy, focus, and cross-timezone collaboration. While our teams work independently, connection and teamwork remain central to how we operate — through regular rituals, meaningful virtual interactions, and in-person gatherings every quarter. These include team offsites and a yearly company-wide retreat to build relationships, spark creativity, and have fun together.

Being remote-first also means we value outcomes over hours and trust our team members to manage their work in a way that suits their unique rhythm and responsibilities. This approach allows us to support a truly flexible work environment, while staying aligned with our mission and values.

At ZOE, working remotely doesn’t mean working alone — it means being empowered, supported, and connected, wherever you are.

Compensation Philosophy

We are committed to offering competitive and equitable compensation that reflects the value of each role and aligns with regional labor market standards. Our approach to compensation goes beyond just base salary — we offer a comprehensive package that includes base pay and stock options, ensuring that every team member is rewarded for their contributions to the company’s growth and success.

We believe that building a thriving team requires not only providing fair and competitive compensation but also fostering an environment where success is shared collectively. Our total compensation package is designed to support the well-being of our employees, recognise their individual contributions, and empower them to grow alongside ZOE.

Benefits & Perks

We understand the significant role our benefits play in motivating, inspiring and safeguarding our employees' well-being. Our benefits strategy is thoughtfully designed to echo our mission and values, recognising the diverse needs arising from different life stages of our ZOEntists.

Our approach to benefits takes an inclusive and flexible view of both personal and professional growth. From competitive health insurance and wellness packages to inclusive parental policies, building connection, and tailored professional development programs, we've got you covered.

At ZOE, we continue to build a benefits package that invests in our team members’ long-term personal and professional growth and wellbeing, adding to this list as it evolves.

Equal opportunities

We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive team where every individual can bring their authentic self to work. We believe that this is key to our success and are dedicated to positively impacting the tech industry. As part of our commitment to equal opportunities, we encourage candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to apply. We ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all and do not discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, marital status, disability, or age. If you require any accommodations during the interview process, please feel free to inform us, and we will make every effort to support your needs.

Backed by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, the IPA, and Sky, Barb has been the source of official TV viewing figures for decades. 




Barb is uniquely placed to empower transformation of the UK TV and advertising ecosystem through reliable and accurate data.  




These data fulfil three purposes:  




To support decisions that are made in the making and distribution of great programmes.  
To support the planning and buying of ad campaigns and informing on brand and sales outcomes.  
To inform how broadcasters and other media services operate in the public interest. 




As the media industry evolves, so does Barb. We've expanded our measurement beyond traditional panels to incorporate large-scale online data and streaming services. Through our campaign reporting tools, Barb also provides the full picture of cross-platform pre and post campaign reporting. 




Our hybrid approach combines people-based panel data with census-level device data to deliver inclusive measurement of total identified viewing across all platforms, services, and devices. This empowers broadcasters, advertisers, and regulators to make more better, fairer, more informed decisions. 




Overview 

We’re seeking a Junior Data Scientist to help build the future of UK audience measurement. This is a unique opportunity to join a small, expert team of 13, reporting directly to the Head of Data Science and working on foundational systems used by major media organisations across the UK. 




You can expect to work on high-impact projects including: 




The Barb Data Hub, a centralised Snowflake data warehouse serving as the single source of truth for Barb data. You’ll help develop a library of reusable analysis tools. 
Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Sharing – ensuring users can apply Barb’s complex methodologies efficiently and accurately. 
Barb Panel Plus, a new system integrating “return path data” from TV sets and set-top boxes with existing panel data. 




These projects pose exciting challenges from the point of view of data engineering, statistical modelling, and software development. This role will be of interest to someone starting their career as a data scientist and excited by the prospect of finding brilliant solutions to these problems. The role would be well-suited to someone who is a talented coder, logical thinker, enjoys working with data, has an interest in the TV industry, and is looking to grow into their career as a data scientist. 




Key responsibilities 




Work closely with the Barb executive team and partners to understand and implement the Barb Calculation Methodology, which is a complex set of conventions and algorithms that describe how to use Barb panel data to calculate standard audience metrics. 
Build and maintain a shared library of reusable data analysis tools for Barb’s users and suppliers. 
Support users of Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Share, ensuring they produce correct and industry-standard outputs. 
Translate parts of the methodology into reliable, production-ready Python code for use across Barb’s systems. 
Contribute to the evaluation and development of statistical and machine learning models for return path data integration. 
Develop ELT pipelines and modelling solutions for data integration projects. 

 




Qualifications 




A degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., STEM, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics). 
Good working knowledge of Python and SQL. 
Experience with Python data packages (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) preferred. 
Strong mathematical and statistical foundation. 
Ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with others. 

 

Experience 




The ideal candidate will have some experience with: 

Data engineering; working with databases, building infrastructure for moving, storing, and processing data.  
Modelling; analysing data using statistical or machine-learning techniques 




Preferred: 

Experience with Snowflake, or other cloud data platforms such as Databricks or BigQuery. 
Familiarity with Snowpark or similar distributed computing frameworks such as Spark. 

For graduates, the above could include projects done at university or during an internship. 




 




Benefits 




Base salary will reflect the responsibilities of the role and be commensurate with experience. Barb offers a discretionary bonus scheme alongside the following benefits. 




Office in central London – with hybrid working options 
Pension contributions up to a maximum of 9% of salary — employees’ contribution matched +3% 
Five weeks paid holiday — rising to six weeks after 10 years’ service 
Holiday purchase scheme — purchase up to five additional days in any calendar year 
Group Life Assurance — four times annual salary 
Group Income Protection — 75% of salary after 26 weeks absence 
Enhanced pay for parental/adoption leave after 18 months of service — 13 weeks at 100% of basic salary followed by 26 weeks at the statutory rate

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalization.

What you will be doing:

You’ll join a London-based agile team building and supporting data science products that drive business impact across PlayStation. You’ll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to serve teams such as marketing, operations, engineering, product planning, R&D, and finance.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Help drive data literacy across the business
Collaborate with a high-performing team of data scientists to apply insights and drive innovation throughout the company.


Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

What you'll be doing:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience

Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:


Experience with data science tooling (e.g., workflow orchestrators like Airflow, feature stores)
Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry

Your role is to build, scale, and maintain the robust, high-performance ML systems that form the core of our fraud detection platform. You will not only consume data but also play a critical role in defining how data is modeled, stored, and served for machine learning purposes. This includes influencing the architecture of our feature generation pipelines and ensuring data quality is paramount throughout the ML lifecycle

You'll have ownership over our ML infrastructure and be empowered to introduce new ideas that enhance our processes and tools. Your day-to-day will involve close collaboration with engineers and data scientists to operate machine learning at scale. This is the perfect opportunity to apply your software engineering expertise to complex machine learning challenges and grow within a collaborative and innovative environment.

Location: London (office-based, ~4 days per week)

Build Something That Matters

native has been building for 10 years, but we're still very much a startup: fast-moving, ambitious, and building with intent. We're creating the infrastructure that connects students, Students’ Unions, universities, and advertisers through a managed marketplace.

Our goal is to increase student engagement while enabling Students’ Unions to secure sustainable funding. For advertisers, we offer meaningful, measurable routes to student audiences. The more aligned these incentives are, the more defensible and scalable our business becomes.

We’re looking for graduates who want to step straight into meaningful work, learn quickly, and grow fast.

What We’re Looking For

We value clarity of thought, good judgement under pressure, and the ability to create structure where none exists.

You Might Be Right For This If


You think in first principles, not borrowed answers – solving problems from the ground up
You thrive in ambiguity – you’re comfortable making decisions when there isn’t a map
You do the work – not for applause, but because it matters to you that things are done well
You’ve got range – you’re not just smart on paper; you’ve done things that demanded resilience, judgement, or initiative


We are open to a wide range of degree backgrounds, but we look for intellectual sharpness and structured thinking. That often shows up in disciplines like engineering, maths, philosophy, languages (whether classical or modern), or history - but not always. If your academic path is less typical, help us understand how your thinking has been shaped and why it stands up.

What You’ll Be Working On

You'll be directly involved in:


Developing predictive models to identify patterns in student behaviour and engagement, using real data from hundreds of thousands of students
Refining student personas by analysing survey responses, behavioural data, and qualitative insights, ensuring accuracy and usefulness
Conducting advanced statistical analysis and clustering to uncover insights about student segments, motivations, and behaviours
Collaborating closely with the Student Personas team to translate analytical findings into clear, actionable recommendations
Creating robust documentation and clearly communicating your methods and results, ensuring reproducibility and clarity


This role is deeply analytical and technical, designed to rapidly build your practical skills in data science and predictive modelling within a real, high-impact environment

Required Skills

You'll be right for this role if:


You have strong analytical skills, demonstrated by excellent academic results, research projects, academic papers, or high placements in data science competitions
You have practical experience with statistical modelling or machine learning techniques (regression analysis, clustering, classification, predictive modelling) through coursework, internships, or independent projects
You are proficient in Python (especially pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, or similar libraries) and comfortable performing data analysis using Jupyter notebooks or similar tools
You are comfortable writing clear, efficient SQL for extracting, cleaning, and preparing datasets, demonstrated through coursework, internships, or personal analytical projects
You have demonstrated initiative by independently exploring additional analytical and machine learning tools or frameworks, such as BigQuery, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar


Progression

This is an initial six-month engagement. If you perform well, the expectation is that you’ll move into a promoted, permanent role at the end of that period. We treat this as a proving ground for long-term hires, not an internship.

During your interview process, you'll be encouraged to speak with previous graduate hires at native who joined through this route, so you can hear directly how this role can set you up for rapid career progression.

Location and ways of working

You’ll be based in our London office, working in person at least four days a week, with one optional day remote. We believe in high-bandwidth collaboration and fast decision-making, so most of the work happens face-to-face.

How To Apply

We don’t want a cover letter. Instead, answer a few questions we have which will help us understand how you think:


A trade-off you’ve had to make and how you decided
A problem you tackled without much guidance
A system or process you’d redesign and how you’d go about it
A time you had to choose what not to do, and why


Also please do include a recent CV, or a link to your LinkedIn profile / equivalent.

And If you’re reading this and thinking, I really want to do this, but I probably won’t get picked - apply anyway. We care far more about how you think and how you show up than whether you tick every imagined box. Don’t rule yourself out.

We’re hiring on a rolling basis. If this sounds like the kind of challenge you’re ready for, get in touch.

Equal Opportunity Statement

We are actively creating an equitable environment for everyone at native to thrive.

          <strong>£35,000 🪙 <br><br></strong><strong>Location: </strong>London (office-based, ~4 days per week)<br><br><strong>Build Something That Matters<br><br></strong>native has been building for 10 years, but we're still very much a startup: fast-moving, ambitious, and building with intent. We're creating the infrastructure that connects students, Students’ Unions, universities, and advertisers through a managed marketplace.<br><br>Our goal is to increase student engagement while enabling Students’ Unions to secure sustainable funding. For advertisers, we offer meaningful, measurable routes to student audiences. The more aligned these incentives are, the more defensible and scalable our business becomes.<br><br>We’re looking for graduates who want to step straight into meaningful work, learn quickly, and grow fast.<br><br><strong>What We’re Looking For<br><br></strong>We value clarity of thought, good judgement under pressure, and the ability to create structure where none exists.<br><br><strong>You Might Be Right For This If<br><br></strong><ul><li>You think in first principles, not borrowed answers – solving problems from the ground up</li><li>You thrive in ambiguity – you’re comfortable making decisions when there isn’t a map</li><li>You do the work – not for applause, but because it matters to you that things are done well</li><li>You’ve got range – you’re not just smart on paper; you’ve done things that demanded resilience, judgement, or initiative<br><br></li></ul>We are open to a wide range of degree backgrounds, but we look for intellectual sharpness and structured thinking. That often shows up in disciplines like engineering, maths, philosophy, languages (whether classical or modern), or history - but not always. If your academic path is less typical, help us understand how your thinking has been shaped and why it stands up.<br><br><strong>What You’ll Be Working On<br><br></strong>You'll be directly involved in:<br><br><ul><li>Developing predictive models to identify patterns in student behaviour and engagement, using real data from hundreds of thousands of students</li><li>Refining student personas by analysing survey responses, behavioural data, and qualitative insights, ensuring accuracy and usefulness</li><li>Conducting advanced statistical analysis and clustering to uncover insights about student segments, motivations, and behaviours</li><li>Collaborating closely with the Student Personas team to translate analytical findings into clear, actionable recommendations</li><li>Creating robust documentation and clearly communicating your methods and results, ensuring reproducibility and clarity<br><br></li></ul>This role is deeply analytical and technical, designed to rapidly build your practical skills in data science and predictive modelling within a real, high-impact environment<br><br><strong>Required Skills<br><br></strong>You'll be right for this role if:<br><br><ul><li>You have strong analytical skills, demonstrated by excellent academic results, research projects, academic papers, or high placements in data science competitions</li><li>You have practical experience with statistical modelling or machine learning techniques (regression analysis, clustering, classification, predictive modelling) through coursework, internships, or independent projects</li><li>You are proficient in Python (especially pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, or similar libraries) and comfortable performing data analysis using Jupyter notebooks or similar tools</li><li>You are comfortable writing clear, efficient SQL for extracting, cleaning, and preparing datasets, demonstrated through coursework, internships, or personal analytical projects</li><li>You have demonstrated initiative by independently exploring additional analytical and machine learning tools or frameworks, such as BigQuery, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar<br><br></li></ul><strong>Progression<br><br></strong>This is an initial six-month engagement. If you perform well, the expectation is that you’ll move into a promoted, permanent role at the end of that period. We treat this as a proving ground for long-term hires, not an internship.<br><br>During your interview process, you'll be encouraged to speak with previous graduate hires at native who joined through this route, so you can hear directly how this role can set you up for rapid career progression.<br><br><strong>Location and ways of working<br><br></strong>You’ll be based in our London office, working in person at least four days a week, with one optional day remote. We believe in high-bandwidth collaboration and fast decision-making, so most of the work happens face-to-face.<br><br><strong>How To Apply<br><br></strong>We don’t want a cover letter. Instead, answer a few questions we have which will help us understand how you think:<br><br><ul><li>A trade-off you’ve had to make and how you decided</li><li>A problem you tackled without much guidance</li><li>A system or process you’d redesign and how you’d go about it</li><li>A time you had to choose what not to do, and why<br><br></li></ul>Also please do include a recent CV, or a link to your LinkedIn profile / equivalent.<br><br>And If you’re reading this and thinking, <em>I really want to do this, but I probably won’t get picked</em> - apply anyway. We care far more about how you think and how you show up than whether you tick every imagined box. Don’t rule yourself out.<br><br>We’re hiring on a rolling basis. If this sounds like the kind of challenge you’re ready for, get in touch.<br><br>Equal Opportunity Statement<br><br>We are actively creating an equitable environment for everyone at native to thrive.<br><br>Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at native. At native, we embrace diversity in all of its forms and foster an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us.

Own KPI definition and reporting, surfacing trends and anomalies across the business.
Lead customer satisfaction measurement initiatives with product and engineering.
Create our AI/analytics roadmap and continuously optimize our data stack for scale.

Strong stakeholder management skills with ability to translate business requests into technical specifications, pushing back when appropriate.
Track record of building automated analytics solutions and reducing manual processes.
Experience with experimentation frameworks, A/B testing, and statistical analysis.
Strong communication skills to present complex data insights to non-technical audiences.

At GRAM, we believe the next great leap for humanity will be physical, not digital. What AGI is to bits, Self-Replication (SR) is to atoms. As an SR research and deployment company, our mission is to make humanity galactic by enabling physical exponential growth. To achieve this, we are conducting foundational research across general-purpose robotics, artificial intelligence, biology, and materials science to enable SR within our lifetimes.

Our first step is to challenge the consensus that robots should look like us. We believe true progress comes from optimizing for function over form. We are creating a new embodiment for intelligence, designed from first principles to build the future physical economy, on and off-world.

The Role

A machine's body is only as capable as the mind that drives it. This role is for the engineers who breathe life into the hardware, teaching our Insectoid robot how to move, perceive, and act in the physical world. You will be responsible for creating the algorithms and software that form the robot's intelligence, from low-level motor skills to high-level reasoning.

This is an opportunity to solve foundational problems in AI and robotics on a novel morphology that has no precedent. You will work at the frontier of control theory, reinforcement learning, and computer vision to give our robot the ability to navigate and interact with complex, unstructured environments, creating the intelligent foundation for its ultimate mission.

Key Responsibilities:


Design and train large-scale, self-supervised models that learn the dynamics of the physical world from raw sensor data.
Develop predictive models that can ""imagine"" future outcomes of potential actions, to be used for planning and improving sample efficiency in RL.
Build generative models that can reconstruct and understand complex 3D scenes from multi-modal sensor inputs.
Integrate learned world models into the robot's planning and control stacks to enable more intelligent and proactive behavior.
Stay at the absolute frontier of academic research in representation learning and generative modeling, applying new breakthroughs to our platform.


About You

You are a first-principles thinker who is energized by solving problems that have no playbook. You are drawn to ambitious, long-term missions and want to build technology that fundamentally changes our physical capabilities. You thrive in a high-agency environment where you are given the ownership and resources to tackle core challenges.

Basic Qualifications:


MS in Computer Science or a related field with 3+ years of experience in machine learning.
Expert proficiency with Python and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
A strong foundation in modern deep learning architectures, including Transformers, VAEs, and GANs.
Experience training large-scale models on large datasets.


Preferred Qualifications:


A PhD with a focus on deep learning, generative models, or representation learning.
A track record of publications in top-tier AI conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR).
Experience applying world models or predictive models in a robotics or control context.
Expertise in self-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.


Location

This is an on-site role at our research lab in El Segundo, California. We offer significant relocation assistance for exceptional candidates.

Interview Process

After submitting your application, we review your portfolio and any exceptional work you've shipped. If your application demonstrates the caliber we seek, you'll enter our interview process, which is designed for speed and substance. We aim to complete it within one week from start to finish.

Compensation

At GRAM, we believe the next great leap for humanity will be physical, not digital. What AGI is to bits, Self-Replication (SR) is to atoms. As an SR research and deployment company, our mission is to make humanity galactic by enabling physical exponential growth. To achieve this, we are conducting foundational research across general-purpose robotics, artificial intelligence, biology, and materials science to enable SR within our lifetimes.

Our first step is to challenge the consensus that robots should look like us. We believe true progress comes from optimizing for function over form. We are creating a new embodiment for intelligence, designed from first principles to build the future physical economy, on and off-world.

The Role

A machine's body is only as capable as the mind that drives it. This role is for the engineers who breathe life into the hardware, teaching our Insectoid robot how to move, perceive, and act in the physical world. You will be responsible for creating the algorithms and software that form the robot's intelligence, from low-level motor skills to high-level reasoning.

This is an opportunity to solve foundational problems in AI and robotics on a novel morphology that has no precedent. You will work at the frontier of control theory, reinforcement learning, and computer vision to give our robot the ability to navigate and interact with complex, unstructured environments, creating the intelligent foundation for its ultimate mission.

Key Responsibilities:


Architect and build the complete perception stack for the Insectoid platform, responsible for turning raw sensor data into a coherent understanding of the world.
Develop robust algorithms for real-time state estimation and sensor fusion, combining data from IMUs, cameras, joint encoders, and other sensors to precisely track the robot's position and orientation.
Implement systems for 3D scene understanding, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and geometric reconstruction of the robot's immediate surroundings.
Design and manage the sensor calibration pipeline, working closely with the hardware team to ensure the highest possible data quality.
Provide clean, reliable, and low-latency perception outputs (e.g., world state, obstacle maps) that serve as the ground truth for our autonomy, manipulation, and world model teams.


About You

You are a first-principles thinker who is energized by solving problems that have no playbook. You are drawn to ambitious, long-term missions and want to build technology that fundamentally changes our physical capabilities. You thrive in a high-agency environment where you are given the ownership and resources to tackle core challenges.

Basic Qualifications:


MS in Computer Science, Robotics, or a related field with 3+ years of experience building perception systems for robots or autonomous vehicles.
Expert proficiency in C++ for real-time applications.
A strong foundation in 3D geometry, linear algebra, and probabilistic filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman Filters, Particle Filters).
Experience with computer vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV) and robotics frameworks (e.g., ROS).


Preferred Qualifications:


A PhD with a focus on robotics perception, state estimation, or computer vision.
A track record of publications in top-tier robotics or computer vision conferences (e.g., ICRA, IROS, RSS, CVPR).
Hands-on experience deploying perception stacks on real-world hardware.
Expertise in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) or visual-inertial odometry.
Familiarity with a variety of sensor modalities, including cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and radar.


Location

This is an on-site role at our research lab in El Segundo, California. We offer significant relocation assistance for exceptional candidates.

Interview Process
