About us:

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad.

Job Description

We are on the lookout for a Data Scientist with linguistic expertise, to join our team and help us create outstanding customer service products. This is a unique opportunity to apply deep linguistic expertise to the challenges of building customer facing, conversational products using NLP, machine learning and generative AI.

You will join the Service Data Science squad on our mission to automate and optimize interactions with customers, making sure they have a high quality experience that scales as our business grows. In this specialist role, you will be the team's expert on the analysis and evaluation of language data, focusing on the nuances of user intent, conversational context, and error analysis to drive the performance of our products. If you also have experience in applying modelling approaches to conversational or other language problems, even better!

If you are a creative problem solver with a passion for language and technology, and you're hungry for a new adventure, a diverse, international and inclusive workplace is waiting for you in the heart of Berlin!

Your mission:

Lead Linguistic Analysis: Dive deep into user conversations to uncover the root causes of model underperformance, using your expertise in pragmatics, semantics, and syntax in multiple languages to identify opportunities for model improvement.

Enhance Model Evaluation and Modelling Approaches: Design, build, and implement fine-grained evaluation datasets and observability tools that move beyond standard metrics to give us high-confidence insights into our models' linguistic capabilities. Use the learnings to improve our models.

Drive Product Improvement: Translate your linguistic analysis into actionable data requirements and strategies that directly improve key business outcomes, such as first-contact resolution and customer satisfaction.

Collaborate and Grow: Work closely with Data Scientists, ML Engineers, and Product Managers to solve practical problems, and have fun while growing together with your team.

Qualifications


A strong academic or professional background in Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, or a related field.
Demonstrable expertise in linguistic analysis, particularly in areas like pragmatics, semantics, ambiguity resolution, and conversational analysis.
Proficiency in Python for data analysis, including experience with libraries like Pandas and creating readable, reproducible analyses (e.g., in Jupyter notebooks).
Experience with SQL for accessing and processing data.
Proven ability to perform detailed error analysis on language data and a solid understanding of how to curate high-quality, annotated datasets.
You are a highly autonomous problem solver, capable of leading projects and delivering results with minimal guidance.
You are fluent in English.
Bonus points: Experience with NLP technologies (e.g., LLMs, BERT, Transformer models) would be amazing, as would experience working on solving language tasks in multiple languages!

Why this matters: Every AI feature you build gets shipped fast and used by real students - meaning your work has an immediate and measurable effect on learning outcomes, user growth, and product-market fit. You’ll be directly accelerating our core business metrics and impact on students worldwide.

What success looks like: You’ll ship meaningful AI-driven features quickly and iterate based on real usage data. Your technical contributions will be visible in the metrics, boosting usage, retention, and engagement. You’ll help shape a product that students rely on every day, while growing your skills in a team that values speed, autonomy, and ownership. Over time, you’ll be known for building solutions that are not only technically sound, but that truly matter to our mission.

Who We Are: Prior Labs is building breakthrough foundation models that understand spreadsheets and databases—the backbone of science and business. Foundation models have transformed text and images, but structured data has remained largely untouched. We’re tackling this $100B+ opportunity to revolutionize how we approach scientific discovery, medical research, financial modeling, and business intelligence.




Our Impact: We aim to be the world-leading organization working on structured data. Our TabPFN v2 model, recently published in Nature, sets the new state-of-the-art for small structured data. Our models have gained significant traction with 1M+ downloads and 3,500+ GitHub stars. We are now building the next generation of models that combine AI advancements with specialized architectures for structured data.




Backing and Momentum: With €9M in pre-seed funding from top-tier investors including Balderton Capital, XTX Ventures, and Hector Foundation—and support from leaders at Hugging Face, DeepMind, and Silo AI—we’re moving rapidly toward commercialization.

This team doesn’t just experiment with AI – they ship it.




Join a Berlin-based product company building AI-powered tools that actually make it to production. Their goal? To make complex business workflows simpler using language models, intelligent agents, and custom automation – all deployed at scale.




From contract analysis to smart search to AI copilots – they’re turning cutting-edge tech into practical, everyday tools.




What you’ll do:

Build and integrate AI features into real-world products using LLMs and retrieval-based pipelines
Develop custom wrappers and APIs for model inference, prompt chains, and semantic search
Work across backend and AI infra: containerised deployments, vector DBs, and monitoring tools
Collaborate with product, design, and ML teams to turn ideas into robust, scalable features




What you’ll bring:

Strong Python development skills
Experience working with AI APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, etc.) or fine-tuned models
Familiarity with prompt engineering, RAG architecture, or vector databases (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS)
Knowledge of modern backend tools: FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, Git
Bonus: experience with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or streaming/async pipelines




Why apply?

Real products, not just experiments or PoCs
A pragmatic AI culture: fast iterations, measurable impact
Team of builders who care more about getting it live than writing 10 papers
Modern hybrid setup in Berlin with flexible in-office expectations




If you want to be the person who brings AI ideas into real life – not just talk about them – this could be your role.




Interviews are open now – apply to grab one of three available slots.

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?


The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

What You’ll Do


Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more.

Team: Product & Engineering

Type: Full-time

Base Salary for the role: $60,000 - $70,000 CAD

At Mogo, we’re building the future of finance through bold innovation and AI-native platforms. This role is part of our Intelligent Investing team.

Build the Future of Wealth - With Intention

Intelligent Investing isn’t about layering AI onto fintech, it’s about reimagining the entire system, where every decision, feature, and line of code reflects clarity, discipline, and long-term thinking.

This isn’t another trading app chasing dopamine. We’re building the opposite:


A platform where restraint is a feature
Where AI isn’t a gimmick, it’s the foundation
Where compounding meets conviction


Our mission is simple: Help a new generation build wealth through intelligence, not impulse.

Why This Role?

We're hiring a small group of high-upside junior engineers to help us build the future of disciplined, AI-native investing. You’ll be working directly with senior builders on:


A full-stack architecture designed for speed, elegance, and scale
AI-native flows that reinforce behavior, not engagement
Advanced feature sets (including crypto and options) gated by process, not hype


You’ll be building product at the intersection of:


Behavioral finance
Responsible crypto innovation
AI systems that think like investors, not algorithms chasing clicks


Who This Is For


You write code with intention, not just speed
You’re obsessed with clean design, thoughtful UX, and systems that don’t shout
You’re not looking to ship more features, you’re looking to build something that lasts
You respect Buffett more than Reddit
You want to work at a company where AI is the engine, not the garnish


What You’ll Work On


Full-stack development across our investing platform
AI-driven interfaces that embed discipline into user flows
Back-end systems that are fast, simple, and scalable
Tools that help real people make better long-term decisions


What We’re Looking For


0–3 years of professional experience (or projects that show you're ready)
Proficiency with modern JS frameworks (React, Next.js) and API development
Curiosity about AI/ML, crypto infrastructure, and behavioral systems
Strong design instincts and a clean aesthetic
Humility, hunger, and a high standard for your work


What We Offer


A rare chance to help build a high-integrity product from the ground up
Senior mentorship and exposure to world-class investors and operators
Small team, zero politics, big impact
Full remote flexibility across Canada
A portfolio you’ll be proud of, for years
Comprehensive Health and Wellness - Access medical, dental, and vision coverage plus a Health Spending Account
Stock Options - Have a stake in the company's success through stock options
Flex Vacation - Benefit from paid time off, including vacation days, holidays, and personal days
Wellbeing Programs - Access counselling services, mental health support, and additional wellness resources


This is not just an engineering role. It’s a bet on your future, and ours.

If that sounds like the right kind of pressure, step inside.

Benefits of working with us:


ALWAYS FULLY REMOTE WORK - Enjoy the flexibility of remote work, supported by necessary resources
Comprehensive Health and Wellness - Access medical, dental, and vision coverage plus a Health Spending Account
Stock Options - Have a stake in the company's success through stock options
Flex Vacation - Benefit from paid time off, including vacation days, holidays, and personal days
Wellbeing Programs - Access counselling services, mental health support, and additional wellness resources


About Us:

We help make it easy for Canadians to achieve financial freedom while making a positive impact.

We live in the most innovative and technologically advanced era, yet so much struggle exists. Most of us are far from where we want to be financially.

We all want a better future. A better world where reaching financial freedom is a question of when, not if. One that's equitable so that all can prosper. One that's safe from the impact of climate change.

Our money has the power to change the world. It’s up to us to do things differently.

Apply today! Do you know anyone who would be a great fit for this role or other roles on our career page? Please share this job posting with them! Mogo is an inclusive place to spend your work life.

For over 20 years, Global Relay has set the standard in enterprise information archiving with industry-leading cloud archiving, surveillance, eDiscovery, and analytics solutions. We securely capture and preserve the communications data of the world’s most highly regulated firms, giving them greater visibility and control over their information and ensuring compliance with stringent regulations.

Though we offer competitive compensation and benefits and all the other perks one would expect from an established company, we are not your typical technology company. Global Relay is a career-building company. A place for big ideas. New challenges. Groundbreaking innovation. It’s a place where you can genuinely make an impact – and be recognized for it.

We believe great businesses thrive on diversity, inclusion, and the contributions of all employees. To that end, we recruit candidates from different backgrounds and foster a work environment that encourages employees to collaborate and learn from each other, completely free of barriers.

Your role:

As a Senior Data Scientist you will be building artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions for Global Relay’s customers. Our solutions are developed by small, focused agile teams of data scientist and developers. You will be applying a wide variety of models to very large electronic communication archives in order to classify and understand communication content.

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale
