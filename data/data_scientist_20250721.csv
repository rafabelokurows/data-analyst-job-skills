About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

About The Team

Before Stripe, every growing internet platform had a payments team. Today, every growing internet platform has an Identity team to verify trustworthiness of a user. Identity verification is a core piece of economic infrastructure for online businesses that enables businesses to digitally verify the user’s Identity (through ID document, Passport, DL) for fraud, regulatory and trust & safety purposes. At Stripe, we're building the future of identity verification and trust in the digital economy.

Why Stripe Identity?


Be part of a team that's building a product with the potential to transform how trust is established in the digital world
Work on challenging technical problems at a global scale
Contribute to a product that will serve diverse industries, from fintech to e-commerce and beyond
Opportunity to shape the future of digital identity and fraud prevention



We leverage ML to serve real-time predictions as part of Stripe’s payment infrastructure and risk controls. We own Identity end-to-end, operating lightning fast world-scale services and cutting-edge ML models. We’re looking for people with a strong background or interest in building successful products while keeping user first perspective, who have the ability to deal with ambiguity, exquisite attention to detail and who are comfortable learning new technologies and systems.

What you’ll do

We are looking for Machine Learning Engineers to own the end-to-end lifecycle of applied ML model development and deployment in service of consumer facing product Identity. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers (MLE), data scientists (DS), and ML platform infrastructure teams to design, build, deploy, and operate Stripe’s ML-powered decisioning systems, including improving existing ML models and developing new ML solutions.

Responsibilities


Design and deploy new models using tools (such as Spark, Presto, XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch) and iteratively improve verification and fraud models to protect millions of users from fraud
Integrate new signals into ML pipelines, derive new ML features, and build workflows to make this process fast
Integrate new models and behaviors into Stripe’s core payment flow
Propose and implement innovative product ideas to reduce costs and combat fraud at Stripe
Collaborate and execute projects cross-functionally with the data science, product management, infrastructure, and risk teams



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


6+ years of industry experience building and shipping ML systems in production
Proficient with ML libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, as well as Spark
Knowledge of various ML algorithms and model architectures
Hands-on experience in designing, training, and evaluating machine learning models
Experience performing analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to model performance and business metrics



Preferred Qualifications


MS/PhD degree in ML/AI or related field (e.g. math, physics, statistics)
Experience with DNNs including the latest architectures such as transformers and LLMs
Experience working in Java or Ruby codebases
Proven track record of building and deploying ML systems that have effectively solved ambiguous business problems
Experience in adversarial domains such as Payments, Fraud, Trust, or Safety



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $212,000 - $318,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location.

1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;

1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Every business is powered by contracts, but managing them can slow companies down and cost millions of dollars. Global innovators like L’Oréal, OpenAI, and Salesforce trust Ironclad to transform contracting into a strategic advantage - accelerating revenue, reducing risk, and driving efficiency. It’s the only platform that manages every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement or a complex NDA.

We’re building the future of intelligent contracting and writing the narrative for how contracts unlock strategic growth. Forrester Wave and Gartner Magic Quadrant have consistently recognized Ironclad as a leader in our category. We’ve also been named one of Fortune’s Great Places to Work six years running, featured on Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work, and recognized by Forbes’ 50 Most Promising AI Companies.

We’re backed by leading investors like Accel, Sequoia, Y Combinator, and BOND. We’d love for you to join us!

About The Role

Ironclad is accelerating its investment in AI to redefine how legal teams manage and understand contracts. As part of this effort, we are hiring an AI Evaluation Engineer to work within our AI Pillar. This role is focused on unlocking insights from our training data, designing feedback loops, and ensuring the continuous improvement of our agentic and ML or LLM-based systems through data-driven evaluation and iteration.

You’ll partner closely with AI Engineers and Product Managers to drive better model quality through systematic analysis, experimentation, and the curation of high-leverage datasets. Your work will directly impact the effectiveness of features like Smart Import, contract understanding, and agentic workflows.

What You'll Be Doing


Analyze training and evaluation datasets to identify distributional gaps, labeling inconsistencies, and long-tail opportunities.
Design and execute labeling campaigns, including development of golden datasets and annotation guidelines.
Build and maintain dashboards that track model accuracy, regression trends, and product-specific KPIs like success rate or answer helpfulness.
Investigate failure modes via prompt clustering, error taxonomy development, and user intent classification.
Operationalize feedback loops: mine product telemetry and human-in-the-loop reviews for signal, then translate into data-driven model improvement strategies.
Partner with engineers and PMs to run structured A/B tests and human evaluations for new models or features.
Support the development of scalable data and evaluation infrastructure for LLMs and agents.
Work with product, engineering and legal to create clear & transparent processes for the handling of customer data in AI training, fine-tuning and evaluation


About You


Bachelor's or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science, Applied Math).
1–3 years of experience in applied ML or data science, preferably in NLP or LLM-based applications.
Strong SQL and Python skills; experience with Jupyter, Pandas, and experiment tracking tools.
Comfortable navigating ambiguity, slicing large datasets, and communicating insights clearly to cross-functional stakeholders.
Experience with prompt analysis, clustering, or user behavior modeling is a plus.
Bonus: familiarity with LLM eval techniques, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or agentic system design.Experience with program management.


Why This Role Matters

AI is critical to the value Ironclad customers get from their contracts, allowing their business to manage risk, close revenue faster and operate more effectively. None of this is possible without reliable and accurate data. This role will lead these efforts, becoming a key contributor to the development of AI solutions in an industry that is likely to be transformed by the new generation of models.

What We Value


Bias for action and data curiosity
Ownership mindset and team-first attitude
Comfort in fast-paced, iterative environments
Passion for building AI products that solve real-world customer problems


Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As an early member of our T&S Data Science and Analytics team, you will play an instrumental role in our company’s mission of building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence by building and scaling a data driven culture from the ground up. In this unique company, technology, and moment in history, your work will be critical to informing our product and commercial strategy as we deploy safe, frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with product, engineering, policy & enforcement to define and measure key company success metrics, analyze user behavior to identify new enforcement opportunities and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You’ve worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into user behavior data to provide insights on safety concerns
Define core metrics that measure the team's success. Set goals, build forecasts, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting
Identify and size opportunities to improve the product, influencing product roadmap through your insights and recommendations
Develop hypotheses on product changes, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics
Build a data driven culture from the ground up by establishing foundational data best practices and making data more accessible across the company


You May Be a Good Fit If You


8+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in an infrastructure or operations context.
5+ years of experience deeply embedding in Product teams
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI.
Expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective.
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress.
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions.
Experience in turning open questions and data into concise and insightful analysis.
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills.


Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$230,000 - $275,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet. We work on challenging problems with large business impact, and seek to foster creativity and innovation.

What you’ll do

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Credit Detection brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s credit risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. Achieving this goal is critical to Stripe’s long term growth and profitability.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Strong working knowledge of incrementality testing, randomized controlled experiments and quasi-experiments.
Experience with building in-house attribution models
Proven success working with both product-led growth funnels and sales-led GTM motions.

At our current size and stage, we embrace a flat organizational structure and value the expertise and contributions of every team member. As such, we have a unified job title for our engineering roles where everyone, including those with Staff-level scope, is considered a Data Scientist. While titles may not change, we are actively seeking a senior and above Data Scientist to join our team.

The base salary range for this role is $144,000- $192,000/year. Final offer amounts will carefully consider multiple factors, including prior experience, expertise, location, and may vary from the amount above.

About Descript

Descript is building a simple, intuitive, fully-powered editing tool for video and audio — an editing tool built for the age of AI. We are a team of 150 — with a proven CEO and the backing of some of the world's greatest investors (OpenAI, Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint Ventures, Spark Capital).

Descript is the special company that's in possession of both product market fit and the raw materials (passionate user community, great product, large market) for growth, but is still early enough that each new employee has a measurable influence on the direction of the company.

Benefits include a generous healthcare package, catered lunches, and flexible vacation time. Our headquarters are located in the Mission District of San Francisco, CA. We're looking to hire people who are local and able to join us at the office when needed. We're flexible, and you're an adult—we don't expect or mandate that you're in the office every day. But we do believe there are valuable and serendipitous moments of discovery and collaboration that come from working together in person.

Descript is an equal opportunity workplace—we are dedicated to equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status. We believe in actively building a team rich in diverse backgrounds, experiences, and opinions to better allow our employees, products, and community to thrive.

We're looking for a highly motivated engineer with experience deploying machine learning algorithms to physical systems in the real world.

The ideal candidate has hands-on experience in perception (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation) and/or behavior learning methods (e.g., Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, diffusion policies). More importantly, you've shipped ML models to robots in production environments, and you understand the complexities that come with it.

What you'll do:


Develop and optimize real-time ML models for edge deployment on robotic systems
Work with vendors to label data and build robust data extraction and labeling pipelines
Design custom metrics to evaluate model performance in the field
Reduce model latency using tools like ONNX, TensorRT, or similar


What we're looking for:


Practical experience applying machine learning with deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to solve real-world problems
Proficiency in Python and comfort with at least one systems language (e.g., C++, Rust)
Experience deploying ML models to robotic systems or other physical platforms
Experience incorporating raw sensor data like camera, lidar, radar, IMUs, etc into deep learning algorithms.
Bonus: Practical application of incorporating 3D geometry into deep learning models
Bonus: Published work in conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, We're especially interested in engineers who thrive at the intersection of ML research and real-world robotics applications.


Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

About The Job

The premium experience for YouTube users involves no ads, backgrounding, downloads (for offline experiences), and many others. The role focuses on understanding and quantifying user behavior that violates the YouTube Premium terms-of-service (ToS). Several streaming services have been cracking down on abuse, and in some cases have seen growth in legit accounts following the crackdown. On YouTube Premium, there are several aspects to premium abuse: creator payout abuse, family plan and cross-border abuse and google account sharing. Each involves developing signals, methods and models that will be used to identify cases where there is a high probability of ToS violations. Further, this analyst will help develop processes for and support enforcement.

At YouTube, we believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share, and build community through our stories. We work together to give everyone the power to share their story, explore what they love, and connect with one another in the process. Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun — and we do it all together.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $141,000-$202,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process.

Inception is a generative AI startup. Leveraging breakthrough AI research, we have developed a platform for training next-generation large language models (LLM) powered by diffusion. Unlike existing auto-regressive models, which only output one token at a time, diffusion LLMs can output many tokens in parallel. This means that they are several times faster and can leverage their additional test-time compute to improve quality. They also enable fine-grained control over their outputs to adhere to specific schema and semantic constraints, and they provide a unified paradigm for combining language with other data modalities, including audio, images, and videos.

Our team is led by Stefano Ermon (co-inventor of diffusion models, flash attention, and DPO; faculty at Stanford), Aditya Grover (co-inventor of node2vec and decision transformers; faculty at UCLA), and Volodymyr Kuleshov (prev. co-founder and CTO at Afresh Technologies; faculty at Cornell), and includes engineers from Google Deepmind, Meta AI, Microsoft AI, and OpenAI.

About Genesis Therapeutics
Genesis Therapeutics is unifying AI and biotech to discover novel and breakthrough treatments for patients with severe and devastating conditions. Genesis was founded on groundbreaking molecular ML research and since has established itself as the industry leader in AI for small molecule drug discovery. Our team of accomplished biotech leaders and expert drug hunters joins forces with deep learning researchers and software engineers who are pioneering predictive and generative AI technologies for molecules.

Our team has created the industry's most advanced molecular AI platform called GEMS (Genesis Exploration of Molecular Space), to accelerate and optimize small molecule drug discovery and to enable the discovery of novel first-in-class and best-in-class small molecule drugs for challenging and/or undruggable targets.

The company has leveraged GEMS to build an internal pipeline with multiple programs against high-value targets, including data-poor and canonically undruggable targets where GEMS is uniquely advantaged. In addition, Genesis has signed AI-focused platform collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies, including most recently Incyte Corporation (Feb 2025) and Gilead Sciences (Sept 2024).

We raised a $200M series B in August 2023, and have raised over $300M in funding from top technology and biotech investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Rock Springs Capital, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Radical Ventures, NVentures (NVIDIA's VC arm), BlackRock, and Menlo Ventures.

Jij denkt in beelden. Als creatief fotograaf leg je meer vast dan alleen een mooi moment. Je vangt sfeer, identiteit en het verhaal achter een merk. Of het nu gaat om portretten met karakter, krachtige campagnebeelden of een volledige beeldserie voor een nieuwe website: jij weet precies wat het nodig heeft. Je werkt zelfstandig, maar bent ook een teamplayer: samen met je collega’s designers, strategen, marketeers en developers bouw je aan merken die blijven hangen. Je voelt je thuis in de studio én op locatie. En heb je skills in copy, design of video? Dan word je bij ons nóg blijer. Klinkt dit als jouw natuurlijke speelveld? Dan ben je misschien wel de fotograaf die we zoeken bij BlackDesk.

 

Ken jij BlackDesk al?

BlackDesk is een creative agency uit Goes, Zeeland. Wij maken dikke merken, strakke campagnes en digitale experiences die blijven hangen. Met een mooi team van bijna 20 creatives, van designers tot developers, werken we voor merken die nét even anders durven te zijn. We werken voor een mooie mix aan opdrachtgevers, ongeveer de helft uit de profit en de andere helft uit de non-profit sector.




We combineren strategie met creatie en zoeken altijd naar manieren om grenzen te verleggen. In wat we doen zit een lekkere dosis ambitie, lef en plezier. We geloven in samenwerken, in scherpte en in lol maken. Werken bij BlackDesk is werken in een omgeving waar ruimte is voor groei en initiatief, op een plek waar we samen mooie dingen maken.




Cultuur: Wat we belangrijk vinden is het goed hebben met elkaar, in een ambitieuze omgeving waar we samen ontwikkelen. Proeven hoe het hier is? Check onze social content of blogs op de site. Of check bijv. de beelden van ons BlackDesk X feestje.




Locatie: Strak kantoor. In het station in Goes, 2e verdieping. Lekker bereikbaar en van alle gemakken voorzien.




Projecten: Branding, campagnes, websites. Check de cases pagina (die we hoognodig weer eens bij moeten werken), voor voorbeelden van projecten. Maar goed, we laten recente projecten graag aan je zien bij een kop koffie.




Wat zoeken we?

BlackDesk is een van de weinige creatieve bureau’s in de omgeving met een in-house fotograaf. Wij geloven namelijk dat het totaalproduct beter wordt met een dedicated beeldspecialist. We hebben dan ook alle spulletjes die een fotograaf nodig heeft om goed te werken. Van body’s en lenzen tot filters, doeken, lichten en een complete studioset. Je vindt hier alles wat je creatieve hart begeert. En het mooiste: je gebruikt het dagelijks voor échte merken en campagnes.




Je maakt beelden die ertoe doen: van het werkgeversmerk van Provincie Zeeland tot employer branding campagnes voor organisaties zoals l’escaut. En natuurlijk leg je ook je collega’s vast, wat bij ons altijd een creatief feestje is.




Eigenlijk… alle foto’s op onze website zijn gemaakt door onze eigen fotografen. Dus als jij houdt van creëren, samenwerken én impact maken: welkom bij BlackDesk.

Je werkt in creatieve teams aan projecten op het snijvlak van branding, campagnes en websites voor een diverse groep opdrachtgevers. Jij zorgt voor beelden die het verschil maken, of dat nu portretten, sfeerbeelden of studiowerk is.




Jij bent:




Een ervaren fotograaf met gevoel voor branding en compositie.
Iemand die moeiteloos schakelt tussen portretshoots, campagnebeelden, locatie- en studiofotografie.
Communicatief sterk en prettig in de omgang met mensen voor én achter de lens.
Zelfstandig in de voorbereiding en uitvoering van shoots, maar werkt ook graag samen met creatieven.
Iemand die ideeën visueel kan doorvertalen naar het juiste beeld voor een merk of campagne.
Flexibel inzetbaar en vaak onderweg voor opdrachten.
Woonachtig op max. 45 km van Goes.




Jij hebt:




Een sterk portfolio met portretten, campagne- en/of merkbeelden.
Ervaring met studiofotografie en het werken met licht, flitsers en opstellingen.
Technische kennis van camera’s, lenzen en bewerkingssoftware (zoals Lightroom en Photoshop).
Ervaring met beeldbewerking en kleurcorrectie.
Affiniteit met vormgeving, websites en digitale communicatie.
Pluspunten als je ook iets doet met video, design of copywriting.




Wat ga je doen?




Fotograferen van mensen, merken, locaties en producten—altijd in dienst van een groter verhaal.
Bedenken, plannen en uitvoeren van creatieve shoots op locatie of in onze eigen studio.
Samenwerken met strategen, designers en developers aan branding, campagnes en websites.
Beeldselectie, nabewerking en afleveren van krachtige beeldseries.
Meedenken in concept en beeldtaal. Jij maakt het merk zichtbaar en voelbaar.




Wat bieden we?

Je werkt bij BlackDesk aan creatieve en impactvolle projecten voor een breed palet aan opdrachtgevers, van commerciële merken tot maatschappelijke organisaties.




Een mooie werkplek in een leuk team.
Alles wat jij nodig heb om in je flow te komen.
Ruimte om je taken af te stemmen op jouw talenten.
Leertijd om nieuwe skills te ontwikkelen.
Een licht en ruim kantoor waar je je thuis voelt.
Een mooie setup met Macbook Pro en zit-sta bureau, ja..die rijmt.
Reiskostenvergoeding
Een marktconform salaris, afhankelijk van jouw ervaring.




Sounds good? Solliciteer! Stuur een e-mail met je CV, portfolio en motivatie.

Het team Inburgering en Educatieve Trajecten bij Scalda is gespecialiseerd in het begeleiden van volwassen cursisten, inburgeraars en statushouders in Zeeland. We bieden verscheidene trajecten aan – in samenwerking met gemeenten – om taalvaardigheden, maatschappelijke participatie en doorstroom naar opleiding of werk te bevorderen.

Wat ga je doen?

Als onderwijsassistent bij team Inburgering en Educatieve Trajecten bied je ondersteuning aan studenten die bezig zijn met het leren van de Nederlandse taal. Je werkt nauw samen met de docent op een groep, gaat zelf met groepjes studenten aan de slag en voert daarnaast taken uit om het team op de locatie te ondersteunen.

Wat vragen we van je?


Je werk- en denkniveau is minimaal MBO 4;
Je hebt affiniteit met de doelgroep anderstaligen
Je bent pedagogisch vaardig;
Je bent ICT vaardig;
Je bent een teamplayer en houdt van samenwerken;
Je bent geduldig en hebt aandacht voor studenten die wat extra’s nodig hebben;
Je bent een persoon die kan relativeren en een flexibele (werk)instelling heeft.


Wat bieden we je?

Je komt terecht in een direct, divers en hecht team dat zich kenmerkt door een energieke, informele en open sfeer. Leidinggevenden geven veel vrijheid in de invulling van je rol, waardoor je ruimte hebt voor persoonlijke en professionele groei.

De functie is conform het functieprofiel Onderwijsassistent en wordt gewaardeerd in functieschaal 6 (min. € 2373,00 / max. € 3404,00). De omvang van de aanstelling is in overleg te bepalen tussen de 0,5 en 1,0 FTE.

Salaris en overige voorwaarden zijn conform cao mbo. Naast dat je gedurende alle schoolvakanties vrij bent, zijn er ook nog andere aantrekkelijke voorwaarden. Zo krijg je naast het salaris en vakantiegeld een eindejaarsuitkering (de zogeheten 13e maand) en een tegemoetkoming in de zorgverzekeringskosten.

Wij hechten sterk aan persoonlijke groei en bieden daarvoor diverse mogelijkheden zoals studiefaciliteiten en loopbaanontwikkeling. Het betreft in eerste instantie een tijdelijk contract voor een jaar. Na deze periode kan, bij goed functioneren en voldoende formatieruimte, het contract verlengd worden dan wel een benoeming voor onbepaalde tijd in deze functie volgen.

Informatie:

Voor informatie over de vacature kun je contact opnemen met Stefanie Goedbloed, teamleider Inburgering en Educatieve Trajecten: sgoedbloed@scalda.nl.

De procedure:

De vacature wordt met een warm welkom zowel in- als extern gedeeld. Interne kandidaten hebben, bij gebleken geschiktheid, voorrang in de procedure.

Ecologische Specialist

DE OPDRACHTGEVER WATERSCHAP SCHELDESTROMEN

Waterschappers zijn doeners. Met de voeten – soms letterlijk – in de klei. Iedere Zeeuw is dagelijks afhankelijk van ons werk. En onze rol krijgt nog meer impact als je kijkt naar de enorme uitdagingen door klimaatverandering, zoals de zeespiegelstijging en beschikbaarheid van zoetwater. Om Zeeland veilig te houden en het welzijn van haar inwoners te waarborgen, zoeken wij collega’s die mee willen bouwen aan onze prachtige provincie. Word jij ook een Waterschapper?

Werkzaamheden

Je draagt bij aan het vertalen van de gedragscode naar praktische hulpmiddelen voor collega’s in het veld en op kantoor. Je werkt onder andere aan heldere werkprotocollen, concrete werkinstructies, een toegankelijke digitale veldgids en de verdere uitwerking van de kaartlagenmethode. Daarmee help je de ecologische richtlijnen toepasbaar en werkbaar te maken in de praktijk.

Wat ga je doen?

Je ondersteunt bij de implementatie van een vastgestelde gedragscode op het gebied van natuurwetgeving binnen een waterschap. De gedragscode is de richtlijn voor ecologisch en juridisch verantwoord werken in het veld. Jouw opdracht is om deze gedragscode concreet te vertalen naar heldere werkinstructies en praktische handvatten voor uitvoerende medewerkers, zoals onderhoudsploegen. Je werkt aan het opstellen van een veldgids waarin staat hoe buitenmedewerkers in de praktijk moeten handelen conform de richtlijn. Het uiteindelijke doel: medewerkers beschikken over alle kennis en middelen om correct en zelfstandig volgens de gedragscode te werken.

Werkzaamheden Omvatten O.a.

– Vertalen van beleid en gedragscode naar concrete werkinstructies.

– Opstellen van een praktische veldgids voor buitenmedewerkers.

– Ophalen van informatie bij betrokken disciplines (ecologie, beheer, juridische zaken).

– Ondersteunen bij interne communicatie en kennisdeling.

– Signaleren van knelpunten in de uitvoeringspraktijk.

Opleiding En Werkervaring

Afgeronde hbo- of wo-opleiding in een relevante richting zoals ecologie, biologie, milieukunde of natuurbeheer. Relevante werkervaring in ecologie, bij voorkeur met beschermde soorten en/of natuurwetgeving. Ervaring met het toepassen van ecologische kennis binnen het kader van de wet- en regelgeving op het gebied van soortbescherming. Ervaring met het ontwikkelen van praktische hulpmiddelen zoals werkprotocollen, werkinstructies of veldgidsen.

Kennis En Vaardigheden

Grondige kennis van beschermde soorten, hun leefomgeving en ecologische processen. Bekendheid met gedragscodes flora- en faunawetgeving (of opvolgers zoals soortenmanagementplannen). Ervaring met GIS en het werken met kaartlagen is een pré (voor het uitwerken van de kaartlagenmethode).

– Vaardigheid in het schrijven van duidelijke, toepasbare en praktijkgerichte teksten.

– Vermogen om ecologische richtlijnen te vertalen naar de praktijk van uitvoerende collega’s (bijvoorbeeld onderhoudsploegen, inspecteurs of projectleiders).

Overige Eisen

– In bezit van rijbewijs B (ten behoeve van eventuele veldbezoeken en bezoeken aan steunpunten).

Functie-eisen

LET OP: Het is voor onze opdrachtgever noodzakelijk dat je aan al de gestelde functie-eisen kunt voldoen. Dit moet overtuigend blijken uit je CV. Alleen dan is reageren op deze opdracht zinvol.

Een bijbaan bij Lidl is sowieso iets voor jou. Echt waar? Jep.

Ten eerste omdat je lekker gaat verdienen in een hecht team. Maar ook omdat het bij #teamlidl allemaal draait om groei en kameraadschap. We bieden afwisselend werk, een goed salaris en een mooie lijst extra benefits.

Ben je op zoek naar een (parttime) baan als weekendhulp, vakkenvuller, hulpkracht of verkoopmedewerker? Lees dan snel verder!

Wat ga je doen?

Je gaat je niet vervelen! Het werk is lekker afwisselend en je wordt meteen onderdeel van een hechte, diverse club: #teamlidl! Samen knallen jullie de schappen vol en houden jullie de winkel netjes. Soms zit je met een big smile achter de kassa en soms maak je een klant niet normaal blij door te vertellen waar het vegetarische gehakt ligt. En wil je net wat meer verantwoordelijkheid? Dat kan bij de groente- en fruitafdeling of de bakkerij. Nice!

Wie ben jij?

Het belangrijkste is dat je een aanpakker bent. Moet er iets gebeuren? BAM, je bent er al! En heb je nog nooit in een supermarkt gewerkt? Geeft niet, je krijgt alles van tevoren uitgelegd. Wat verder belangrijk is:


Sowieso dat je vriendelijk en behulpzaam bent (richting klanten en je lieve collega’s)
Je bent 15 jaar of ouder*
Ben je 15 jaar? Dan heb je een aangepast takenpakket. Tijdens het inwerken leer je alles wat je moet weten voor een top start. Vanaf 16 jaar word je bij ons allround ingezet.


Wat krijg jij van ons?

Sowieso een bijbaan die niet SAAI is. Die collega’s waarmee je samenwerkt? Die zouden zomaar je vrienden kunnen worden. En je kunt zelf aangeven hoeveel je wilt werken. Volgende maand wat minder? Dat komt goed. Juist meer uren in je vakantie werken? Geen probleem! We betalen je voor elke minuut die je werkt. Daarnaast doen we veel leuke dingen naast werk, zoals teamuitjes en het jaarlijkse Lidl voetbaltoernooi.

Klinkt dit goed? Dan kun je makkelijk solliciteren, zonder motivatiebrief en cv. Laat je gegevens achter en geef daarbij aan waar je wilt werken (je kunt meerdere winkels opgeven). Daarna start onze Lidl game en speel jij je weg naar binnen. Als alles goed is, kun je direct beginnen met je bijbaan. Ook wanneer je alleen beschikbaar bent in het weekend of bijvoorbeeld in de avond. Daar komen we wel uit. Sowieso.

Jouw salaris als hulpkracht

Hoeveel je gaat verdienen, hangt af van je leeftijd en het aantal uren dat je werkt. Hieronder kun je zien wat jouw salaris per uur is.


15 jaar: € 5,99 per uur.
16 jaar: € 6,91 per uur.
17 jaar: € 7,90 per uur.
18 jaar: € 9,34 per uur.
19 jaar: € 11,21 per uur.
20 jaar: € 14,94 per uur.
21+ jaar: € 18,68 per uur


Dit is jouw all-in bruto loon, dus inclusief vakantietoeslag. Oja, zit je in een tussenjaar of ben je op zoek naar een bijbaan waarin je meer uur per week kunt werken? Solliciteer dan op de vacature ‘ Verkoopmedewerker ’.

Daarna start onze Lidl game en speel jij je weg naar binnen. Als alles goed is, kun je direct beginnen met je bijbaan. Ook wanneer je alleen beschikbaar bent in het weekend of bijvoorbeeld in de avond. Daar komen we wel uit. Sowieso.

          <strong>Samenvatting<br><br></strong>Een bijbaan bij Lidl is sowieso iets voor jou. Echt waar? Jep.<br><br>Ten eerste omdat je lekker gaat verdienen in een hecht team. Maar ook omdat het bij #teamlidl allemaal draait om groei en kameraadschap. We bieden afwisselend werk, een goed salaris en een mooie lijst extra benefits.<br><br>Ben je op zoek naar een (parttime) baan als weekendhulp, vakkenvuller, hulpkracht of verkoopmedewerker? Lees dan snel verder!<br><br><strong>Wat ga je doen?<br><br></strong>Je gaat je niet vervelen! Het werk is lekker afwisselend en je wordt meteen onderdeel van een hechte, diverse club: #teamlidl! Samen knallen jullie de schappen vol en houden jullie de winkel netjes. Soms zit je met een big smile achter de kassa en soms maak je een klant niet normaal blij door te vertellen waar het vegetarische gehakt ligt. En wil je net wat meer verantwoordelijkheid? Dat kan bij de groente- en fruitafdeling of de bakkerij. Nice!<br><br><strong>Wie ben jij?<br><br></strong>Het belangrijkste is dat je een aanpakker bent. Moet er iets gebeuren? BAM, je bent er al! En heb je nog nooit in een supermarkt gewerkt? Geeft niet, je krijgt alles van tevoren uitgelegd. Wat verder belangrijk is:<br><br><ul><li> Sowieso dat je vriendelijk en behulpzaam bent (richting klanten en je lieve collega’s)</li><li> Je bent 15 jaar of ouder*</li><li> Ben je 15 jaar? Dan heb je een aangepast takenpakket. Tijdens het inwerken leer je alles wat je moet weten voor een top start. Vanaf 16 jaar word je bij ons allround ingezet.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Wat krijg jij van ons?<br><br></strong>Sowieso een bijbaan die niet SAAI is. Die collega’s waarmee je samenwerkt? Die zouden zomaar je vrienden kunnen worden. En je kunt zelf aangeven hoeveel je wilt werken. Volgende maand wat minder? Dat komt goed. Juist meer uren in je vakantie werken? Geen probleem! We betalen je voor elke minuut die je werkt. Daarnaast doen we veel leuke dingen naast werk, zoals teamuitjes en het jaarlijkse Lidl voetbaltoernooi.<br><br>Klinkt dit goed?

Bij Veiligheidsregio Midden- en West-Brabant kan dat. Dankzij jouw coördinerende skills, je vermogen om snel te schakelen en je klantgerichtheid weet jij burgers in nood gerust te stellen en je collega’s op straat op weg te helpen. Burgers en collega’s rekenen op jou! Het Operationeel Centrum Veiligheidsregio/Brandweer is onderdeel van de gemeenschappelijke meldkamer Zeeland/West-Brabant.

Wat ga je doen?

Als centralist op het operationeel centrum sta je direct in contact met burgers in nood via het landelijke alarmnummer 112 of 0900-0904. Aan jou de taak om burgers gerust te stellen. Onbevooroordeeld, correct en klantgericht.


Je neemt meldingen aan, vormt snel een goed beeld van het incident en alarmeert op basis daarvan de juist eenheden en functionarissen.
Je onderhoudt contact met de eenheden, coördineert het berichtenverkeer en werkt samen met collega’s van de meldkamer politie, ambulance en de calamiteitencoördinator.
Jij voert regie over het incident, het alarmeren en aanrijden van de juiste eenheden.


Een ontzettend uitdagende functie dus. Om dit werk zo goed mogelijk te kunnen doen, start je bij indiensttreding met een opleiding tot centralist. Het werk is afwisselend en gaat 24/7 door. Dat betekent dat je onregelmatige diensten gaat draaien. Zowel in de ochtend, avond- als nachtdiensten maar ook tijdens feestdagen.

Het operationeel centrum is gevestigd in Bergen op Zoom, in het regiokantoor van de politie (naast het NS-station). Het is in allerlei opzichten één van de nieuwste meldkamers in Nederland en onderdeel van de Landelijke Meldkamer Samenwerking. Hier werken we samen met centralisten van 3 disciplines (ambulance, politie en brandweer). Maar ook het Real Time Intelligence Center (RTIC) en de calamiteitencoördinator (CaCo) hebben een vaste plaats op het operationeel centrum.

Het team

Werken op het operationeel centrum brandweer doe je uiteraard niet alleen. Het team bestaat uit ongeveer 24 collega's. Naast centralisten kent het operationeel centrum twee adviseurs en een afdelingshoofd. Elke dienst draai je samen met 2 of 3 collega’s. Geen dienst is hetzelfde. Van een kat in de boom tot een enorme brand; met elkaar pakken we elk incident aan!

Wat breng je mee?

Naast dat je graag maatschappelijk betrokken bent, begrijp je de urgentie van je functie. De veiligheid van burgers staat voor jou voorop.

Je begrijpt dat de meldkamer een plek is waar technologie, vakinhoudelijke én maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen samen komen en dat dit voortdurend in beweging is. Je blijft dan ook graag betrokken en leert elke dag bij.

Stressbestendig zijn en de juiste beslissingen kunnen nemen onder tijdsdruk is jou niet vreemd. Naast analytisch, ben je probleemoplossend en kun je prioriteiten stellen.

Daarnaast Neem Je Mee


Werk- en denkniveau op tenminste mbo 4;
Je spreekt en verstaat de Nederlandse taal vloeiend. Engels en Duits of een andere vreemde taal is een pré;
Je bent digitaal vaardig;
Je hebt voldoende kennis van de brandweerorganisatie, het kennisniveau bevelvoerder is een pré.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""
