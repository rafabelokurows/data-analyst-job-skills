We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The team




ResearchGate’s Data Science and Machine Learning team is a multidisciplinary engineering team, consisting of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and Data Engineers.




The team owns the end-to-end development of ML-enabled products as well as the infrastructure that powers ML-driven development across the Engineering department.




As a cross-functional team, we are responsible for managing the full ML product life-cycle, including identifying opportunities, matching data sources with novel ML approaches, prototyping and scaling models, and deploying and maintaining services within ResearchGate’s engineering infrastructure.




Collaboration is critical to our team’s success; team members ask for and offer help on each others’ projects and own objectives collectively, and we work closely with stakeholders in Product and other Engineering teams.




We balance pragmatic solutions within our existing tech stack with forward-facing experiments, trying new solutions, employing new technologies, and informing ResearchGate’s ML and AI strategy.







Responsibilities:




Proactively identify and evaluate opportunities for data products and automation via Machine Learning models, including assessing the impact, risks and technical feasibility of potential projects in collaboration with Engineering and Product.

Very strong proficiency in SQL is mandatory, proficiency in Big Data technologies (e.g. BigQuery, Hadoop, Flink, PySpark, Dask, etc.) is a nice to have.
Ability to translate business requirements into data-driven solutions.
Excellent communication and prioritization skills.




Your Profile:




You are comfortable in a role that straddles Data Science and software engineering.
You are excited about finding ways to improve our products with data and Machine Learning models.
You enjoy working independently, taking technical project ownership, and designing complete systems to solve challenges.
You are comfortable working at the interface between engineering, product, and business; being actively involved with the entire value chain around the models you develop.
You are eager to learn and research new methods, solutions, and technologies.
You love to work with data as much as you enjoy communicating your findings to an interested audience.
You are a strong team player and know that results come from great people working together around meaningful ideas.
You understand our mission and want to help us achieve it.




The Interview Process:




You will interview with several ResearchGate team members, including your hiring manager, potential teammates, and senior leadership. Your interview process will include experience-based interviews, technical challenges, and a Data Science case study.

Who We Are: Prior Labs is building breakthrough foundation models that understand spreadsheets and databases—the backbone of science and business. Foundation models have transformed text and images, but structured data has remained largely untouched. We’re tackling this $100B+ opportunity to revolutionize how we approach scientific discovery, medical research, financial modeling, and business intelligence.




Our Impact: We aim to be the world-leading organization working on structured data. Our TabPFN v2 model, recently published in Nature, sets the new state-of-the-art for small structured data. Our models have gained significant traction with 1M+ downloads and 3,500+ GitHub stars. We are now building the next generation of models that combine AI advancements with specialized architectures for structured data.




Backing and Momentum: With €9M in pre-seed funding from top-tier investors including Balderton Capital, XTX Ventures, and Hector Foundation—and support from leaders at Hugging Face, DeepMind, and Silo AI—we’re moving rapidly toward commercialization.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.
Accelerate your professional growth with unique career opportunities.

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)

Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone. Our recruitment process is free from discrimination of any kind — including on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

This team doesn’t just experiment with AI – they ship it.




Join a Berlin-based product company building AI-powered tools that actually make it to production. Their goal? To make complex business workflows simpler using language models, intelligent agents, and custom automation – all deployed at scale.




From contract analysis to smart search to AI copilots – they’re turning cutting-edge tech into practical, everyday tools.




What you’ll do:

Build and integrate AI features into real-world products using LLMs and retrieval-based pipelines
Develop custom wrappers and APIs for model inference, prompt chains, and semantic search
Work across backend and AI infra: containerised deployments, vector DBs, and monitoring tools
Collaborate with product, design, and ML teams to turn ideas into robust, scalable features




What you’ll bring:

Strong Python development skills
Experience working with AI APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, etc.) or fine-tuned models
Familiarity with prompt engineering, RAG architecture, or vector databases (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS)
Knowledge of modern backend tools: FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, Git
Bonus: experience with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or streaming/async pipelines




Why apply?

Real products, not just experiments or PoCs
A pragmatic AI culture: fast iterations, measurable impact
Team of builders who care more about getting it live than writing 10 papers
Modern hybrid setup in Berlin with flexible in-office expectations




If you want to be the person who brings AI ideas into real life – not just talk about them – this could be your role.

THERMELEON | Richting klimaatneutrale glastuinbouw




Ons product – de Thermeleon Warmtebatterij – is een innovatieve etmaalbuffer voor kassen. Het verbetert de energie-efficiëntie van kassen door de overtollige warmte strategisch te hergebruiken tijdens de dag-nachtcyclus. Zo verlagen we het aardgasgebruik substantieel en is er een hogere klimaatgelijkheid over de kas heen. In deze rol zet je grotendeels zelfstandig experimenten en analyses op en voert ze – samen met de rest van de R&D-afdeling – uit. Dit omvat tests naar de prestatie, het materiaal en de chemische eigenschappen van verschillende productvarianten. Je analyseert de resultaten en koppelt die onder andere terug aan de Product Design engineer. Je hebt ook de vrijheid om mee te denken over het (toekomstige) productontwerp. In alle stappen zul je nauw samenwerken met je collega's, met een gevarieerde achtergrond (Business, Scheikunde, Bouwkunde, Natuurkunde Werktuigbouwkunde). Binnen de baan is er ook ruimte om op hoger level strategisch mee te denken over de productontwikkeling-strategie.

Sollicitatieproces

Ben je enthousiast over deze functie en wil je solliciteren? Dan kun je de volgende stappen verwachten.


01. Ontvangstbevestiging


Iedere sollicitant ontvangt een bevestiging via de mail. Heb je deze niet ontvangen? Soms komt deze sollicitatiebevestiging in je spamfilter of bij je ongewenste e-mail terecht (afhankelijk van je instellingen). Heb je toch geen bevestiging ontvangen, heb je aanvullende vragen of wil je informatie over de status van je sollicitatie? Dan kun je contact opnemen via de contactgegevens die in de vacature vermeld staan.


02. Selectiegesprekken


Het eerste gesprek is vaak een kennismakingsgesprek/selectiegesprek met je toekomstige leidinggevende en de recruiter. Als beide partijen na dit gesprek blij zijn met elkaar, volgt er een tweede gesprek. Het tweede gesprek gaat meer over de inhoud van de functie. Bij dit gesprek wordt mogelijk ook een collega van jouw toekomstige afdeling betrokken. Voor sommige functies volgt na het tweede gesprek een assessment, hiervan wordt je tijdens de procedure op de hoogte gesteld.


03. Aanbieding


Als de uitkomst van de gesprekken positief is en we van beide kanten het gevoel hebben “dit is een match!”, dan ontvang je van ons een aanbieding om bij Dunea in dienst te komen. Dit stemmen we natuurlijk eerst met je af. Na je akkoord wordt de arbeidsovereenkomst opgemaakt en verstuurd. Omdat wij transparant zijn en verrassingen willen voorkomen, vermelden wij bij al onze vacatures de salarisschaal.


04. Screening


Dunea is verantwoordelijk voor het leveren van veilig en betrouwbaar drinkwater en is hiermee onderdeel van de vitale infrastructuur van Nederland. Als werkgever vinden we transparantie en betrouwbaarheid essentieel voor een goede samenwerking. Daarom laten wij alle nieuwe medewerkers screenen door onze screeningspartner DISA. Deze screening bestaat minimaal uit een geldige VOG, een check op diploma’s, een referentiecheck en het invullen van een integriteitsvragenlijst. Voor bepaalde functies geldt een aanvullend screeningsonderzoek. Hierover word je gedurende de procedure geïnformeerd.

A personality that shines, the ability to adapt to any situation and make people feel at ease. These are a few of the qualities we’re looking for in our cabin crew.

As the face of Emirates, you’ll be the person customers turn to for help and direction when they fly with us, so you need to be friendly, observant and able to provide the right support.

Being a member of the cabin crew is so much more than a service role - safety is our highest priority. You’ll need to lead confidently and take control when it comes to managing aircraft services, security, and safety procedures. This comes from the world-class learning experience our crew receive at our state-of-the-art facility in Dubai.




Qualifications & Experience




Here are some other things we look for in our cabin crew:

You’ve had more than a year’s experience in hospitality/customer service
You have a positive attitude and the natural ability to provide excellent service in a team environment, dealing with people from many cultures
Your minimum qualification is high school graduate (Grade 12)
You need to be fluent in written and spoken English (ability to speak another language is an advantage)
You’re at least 160cm tall and can reach 212 cm while standing on tiptoes, to enable you to reach emergency equipment on all aircraft types
No visible tattoos while you’re in Emirates cabin crew uniform (without covering them with bandages or cosmetics)
As Emirates cabin crew, you’ll be based in Dubai and will need to meet the UAE's employment visa requirements




Aside from the requirements of the role, you should be determined to always perform to the highest standards, focus on being solution oriented, and be able to manage a demanding work schedule. You should have the ability to deliver an authentic experience to our customers. You’ll be culturally aware and reflect the Emirates personality - professional, empathetic, progressive, visionary and cosmopolitan.

Average Total Pay = AED 10,170 / month (~USD 2,770, EUR 2,710 or GBP 2,280).

Als Senior Machine Learning en Platform Engineer bouw je samen met je collega’s aan het data en analyse platform van de Gemeente Rotterdam.

Jouw functie

Jij wordt blij van het werken met data en machine learning modellen in Azure Cloud. Als Senior Machine Learning en Platform Engineer bouw je met je collega’s aan het Data en Analyse Platform van de gemeente Rotterdam (DAP’R). Deze Azure omgeving levert op een gecontroleerde wijze, veilig en transparant data- en informatieproducten en diensten aan Advanced Analytics en Business Intelligence -teams.

Je bent lid van een scrumteam en werkt Agile/Scrum aan het ontwerpen, opbouwen en opleveren van het platform voor Business Intelligence (BI) en Advanced Analytics (AA). Samen met je team lever je de techniek, configureer je en draag je bij aan de implementatie van Azure infrastructuur en ontwikkelframework, zodat het platform optimaal werkt voor ontwikkelaars en analisten. Daarnaast ben je door je specialistische kennis op Azure een prettige gesprekspartner voor afnemers en stakeholders.

De functie Senior Machine Learning en Platform Engineer is centraal gepositioneerd binnen een jong team: DAP’R PlatformOps, onder de afdeling Onderzoek en Business Intelligence (OBI). Je werkt nauw samen met het team van solution architecten, data-engineers, technisch beheerders, *support engineers van Microsoft en Databricks* data-scientists en BI specialisten voor het verder uitwerken van de doelarchitectuur van het platform binnen de kaders die zijn voorgeschreven vanuit beleid, wet en de datastrategie.

Gemeente Rotterdam heeft als doelarchitectuur het realiseren van een Data en AI Platform gebaseerd op Azure technologie. Wij willen DAP’R zelf gaan beheren en optimaliseren. Hiervoor starten wij een pilot “Self Managed met Databricks” om het platform en het framework met bijstuurmomenten vorm te geven. Vanuit dit platform leveren wij aansluitend ook de Azure Machine Learning (AML) omgeving waarin verschillende afnemers bouwen aan innoverende AI en ML producten. Dit gecombineerde platform dient te voldoen aan de vastgestelde Enterprise security, privacy en compliance standaarden.

Vind je het leuk om hierin mee te doen en breng je kennis en ervaring mee op deze gebieden, dan zijn wij op zoek naar jou!

Jouw profiel

Wij zoeken een gedreven AI engineer die ons energieke en innovatieve team komt versterken in het vormgeven van de toekomst van Lefebvre Sdu. Samen bouwen we aan de nieuwe generatie van onderzoeksmogelijkheden voor advocaten en fiscalisten.

AI is de juridische sector snel aan het veranderen. Deze technologie biedt veel mogelijkheden om het werk van juristen en fiscalisten efficiënter en leuker te maken. Lefebvre Sdu leidt deze transitie in de Nederlandse markt met ons product GenIA-L. Dit is het eerste AI product in Nederland dat juridische en fiscale vraagstukken betrouwbaar kan beantwoorden en wordt dan ook dagelijks veelvuldig gebruikt.

Onze ambitie? GenIA-L naar een hoger niveau tillen. Dat betekent: nóg betrouwbaardere antwoorden op steeds complexere juridische vragen, en een systeem dat naadloos aansluit op het dagelijkse werkproces van professionals.

Daarom zoeken we jou – een assertieve AI engineer die impact wil maken in een domein dat ertoe doet. Je schrikt niet terug voor complexiteit, maar duikt er juist met nieuwsgierigheid in. De komende periode werk je mee aan het verbeteren van de kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid van onze RAG-pipeline. Ook bouw je aan nieuwe features waarmee klanten hun eigen documenten kunnen analyseren en op een vernieuwende manier jurisprudentie kunnen doorzoeken.

Je denkt verder dan je code. Je komt met ideeën om ons product slimmer, sneller of gebruiksvriendelijker te maken – en test die ideeën in de praktijk. Je haalt energie uit experimenteren en ziet elke iteratie als een kans om te leren. Ondertussen blijf je jezelf technisch uitdagen en ontwikkelen.

Wat jij meebrengt


Je volgt de ontwikkelingen in AI op de voet en weet hoe je ze toepast in de praktijk.
Je werkt pragmatisch en voelt je comfortabel in een snel veranderende omgeving.
Onduidelijkheid? Jij ziet het als een kans om initiatief te nemen en richting te geven.
Je denkt vanuit het probleem van de klant en bouwt oplossingen die écht waarde toevoegen.
Je hebt diepgaande kennis van Python en ervaring met de relevante machine learning libraries
Je bent vertrouwd met Kubernetes.
Je pakt eigenaarschap in data science-projecten en stuurt ze zelfstandig aan.
Je wisselt graag AI experimenten af met back-end development


Wat je van ons mag verwachten

Je sluit je aan bij een betrokken team dat samen beslissingen neemt, open communiceert en écht impact wil maken. Binnen dat team krijg jij de ruimte om je rol zelf vorm te geven – en de vrijheid om je te ontwikkelen in de richting die jou motiveert.

We bieden je een goed basissalaris (bij aanvang vanaf € 4.500) op basis van 36-urige werkweek) en kennen we een deels winstafhankelijke eindejaarsuitkering en uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een aanvullend persoonlijk keuzebudget van 4% waarmee je bijvoorbeeld kunt sparen voor extra verlof. En het spreekt voor zich dat je hybride kunt werken als je dat wilt.

Let op: we nemen alleen sollicitanten aan die in Nederland wonen.

Vacancy AI engineer

We are looking for a driven AI engineer to join our energetic and innovative team in shaping the future of Lefebvre Sdu. Together, we are building the next generation of research tools for lawyers and tax professionals.

AI is rapidly transforming the legal sector. This technology offers many opportunities to make the work of legal and tax professionals more efficient and enjoyable. Lefebvre Sdu is leading this transition in the Dutch market with our product, GenIA-L. This is the first AI product in the Netherlands capable of reliably answering legal and tax-related questions, and it is used extensively on a daily basis.

Our ambition? To elevate GenIA-L to the next level. That means: even more reliable answers to increasingly complex legal questions, and a system that integrates seamlessly into the daily workflow of professionals.

That's why we're looking for you – an assertive AI engineer who wants to make an impact in a domain that matters. You’re not daunted by complexity; instead, you approach it with curiosity. In the coming period, you will work on improving the quality and reliability of our RAG pipeline. You'll also develop new features, enabling clients to analyze their own documents and explore case law in innovative ways.

You think beyond just your code. You come up with ideas to make our product smarter, faster, or more user-friendly – and you test those ideas in practice. You thrive on experimentation and see every iteration as an opportunity to learn. Meanwhile, you continue to challenge and develop yourself technically.

What You Bring


You closely follow the developments in the AI domain and know how to apply them in practice.
You work pragmatically and feel comfortable in a fast-changing environment.
Uncertainty? You see it as an opportunity to take initiative and provide direction.
You think from the customer’s perspective and build solutions that truly add value.
You have in-depth knowledge of Python and experience with the relevant machine learning libraries.
You are familiar with Kubernetes.
You take ownership of data science projects and manage them independently.
You enjoy alternating between AI experiments and back-end development.


What You Can Expect From Us

You will join a dedicated team that makes decisions together, communicates openly, and genuinely strives to make an impact. Within this team, you’ll have the space to shape your own role – and the freedom to develop in the direction that motivates you.

We offer you a competitive base salary (starting at € 4.500 based on a 36-hour workweek) and a partially profit-dependent year-end bonus. Our excellent secondary benefits include an additional personal choice budget of 4%, which you can use, for example, to save for extra leave. Naturally, hybrid working is an option if you prefer it.

Please note that we only accept applicants who live in the Netherlands.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Backed by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, the IPA, and Sky, Barb has been the source of official TV viewing figures for decades. 




Barb is uniquely placed to empower transformation of the UK TV and advertising ecosystem through reliable and accurate data.  




These data fulfil three purposes:  




To support decisions that are made in the making and distribution of great programmes.  
To support the planning and buying of ad campaigns and informing on brand and sales outcomes.  
To inform how broadcasters and other media services operate in the public interest. 




As the media industry evolves, so does Barb. We've expanded our measurement beyond traditional panels to incorporate large-scale online data and streaming services. Through our campaign reporting tools, Barb also provides the full picture of cross-platform pre and post campaign reporting. 




Our hybrid approach combines people-based panel data with census-level device data to deliver inclusive measurement of total identified viewing across all platforms, services, and devices. This empowers broadcasters, advertisers, and regulators to make more better, fairer, more informed decisions. 




Overview 

We’re seeking a Junior Data Scientist to help build the future of UK audience measurement. This is a unique opportunity to join a small, expert team of 13, reporting directly to the Head of Data Science and working on foundational systems used by major media organisations across the UK. 




You can expect to work on high-impact projects including: 




The Barb Data Hub, a centralised Snowflake data warehouse serving as the single source of truth for Barb data. You’ll help develop a library of reusable analysis tools. 
Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Sharing – ensuring users can apply Barb’s complex methodologies efficiently and accurately. 
Barb Panel Plus, a new system integrating “return path data” from TV sets and set-top boxes with existing panel data. 




These projects pose exciting challenges from the point of view of data engineering, statistical modelling, and software development. This role will be of interest to someone starting their career as a data scientist and excited by the prospect of finding brilliant solutions to these problems. The role would be well-suited to someone who is a talented coder, logical thinker, enjoys working with data, has an interest in the TV industry, and is looking to grow into their career as a data scientist. 




Key responsibilities 




Work closely with the Barb executive team and partners to understand and implement the Barb Calculation Methodology, which is a complex set of conventions and algorithms that describe how to use Barb panel data to calculate standard audience metrics. 
Build and maintain a shared library of reusable data analysis tools for Barb’s users and suppliers. 
Support users of Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Share, ensuring they produce correct and industry-standard outputs. 
Translate parts of the methodology into reliable, production-ready Python code for use across Barb’s systems. 
Contribute to the evaluation and development of statistical and machine learning models for return path data integration. 
Develop ELT pipelines and modelling solutions for data integration projects. 

 




Qualifications 




A degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., STEM, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics). 
Good working knowledge of Python and SQL. 
Experience with Python data packages (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) preferred. 
Strong mathematical and statistical foundation. 
Ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with others. 

 

Experience 




The ideal candidate will have some experience with: 

Data engineering; working with databases, building infrastructure for moving, storing, and processing data.  
Modelling; analysing data using statistical or machine-learning techniques 




Preferred: 

Experience with Snowflake, or other cloud data platforms such as Databricks or BigQuery. 
Familiarity with Snowpark or similar distributed computing frameworks such as Spark. 

For graduates, the above could include projects done at university or during an internship. 




 




Benefits 




Base salary will reflect the responsibilities of the role and be commensurate with experience. Barb offers a discretionary bonus scheme alongside the following benefits. 




Office in central London – with hybrid working options 
Pension contributions up to a maximum of 9% of salary — employees’ contribution matched +3% 
Five weeks paid holiday — rising to six weeks after 10 years’ service 
Holiday purchase scheme — purchase up to five additional days in any calendar year 
Group Life Assurance — four times annual salary 
Group Income Protection — 75% of salary after 26 weeks absence 
Enhanced pay for parental/adoption leave after 18 months of service — 13 weeks at 100% of basic salary followed by 26 weeks at the statutory rate

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Role Overview:

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalization.

What you will be doing:

You’ll join a London-based agile team building and supporting data science products that drive business impact across PlayStation. You’ll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to serve teams such as marketing, operations, engineering, product planning, R&D, and finance.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Help drive data literacy across the business
Collaborate with a high-performing team of data scientists to apply insights and drive innovation throughout the company.


Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

What you'll be doing:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience
Experience applying data science techniques such as supervised/unsupervised learning, segmentation, forecasting, causal inference, and uplift modelling
Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:


Experience with data science tooling (e.g., workflow orchestrators like Airflow, feature stores)
Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world.

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world gets built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

Don't see a role that's the right fit right now?

We're always interested in meeting passionate and talented individuals. If you'd like to be considered for opportunities, please submit your application here.

Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

We are looking for our first Data Scientist to lead data science efforts across autonomy, safety, and product. As the lead you will help set the foundation for how data science is done at Bedrock, you'll deliver the most critical insights across many domains, and you'll define the future growth of the team.

We're looking for a data scientist who is adept at working with infrastructure and data engineering teams, has experience with complex data similar to autonomy, robotics, or complex ad-tech use cases. We're also looking for someone who has experience in fast growing companies and startups.

If you think this describes you, in whole or in part, we'd love to talk to you about joining us to be our first data scientist.

Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

How You Will Make An Impact


Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth

Preferred Experience


Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python


Who You Are

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more. Due to high application volume, we may not be able to respond to everyone.

Job Summary

The Sea Around Us is a research initiative, which, since its inception in 1994, has made available an online searchable Atlas of reconstructed marine capture fisheries catches from 1950 to the present of all maritime countries of the world via its website at www.seaaroundus.org. This global catch database permits the testing of fisheries-related global hypotheses applied to marine conservation concerns and has served as the underlying database for many articles published by the Sea Around Us members and their collaborations in peer-reviewed journals.

Recently, the Sea Around Us obtained support from Minderoo Foundation for a project that will have an 18-month duration. This project’s objective is to update the catch reconstructions of the world’s maritime fishing nations to the most recent year (2022). This project includes the updates to 2022 or most recent year, the associated databases on price, end-use, fishing access and high seas catches.

In addition, the Sea Around Us embarked on the reconstructions of the world’s inland fisheries, with the recent publication of a first in a series of such reconstructions for Canada, the USA State of Minnesota, ten country members of the ASEAN and all countries in Africa.

The Sea Around Us envisions the continuation of the assessment of the world’s fish stocks based on the reconstructed catches and the estimation of maximum sustainable yields (CMSY/BSM) method developed by Rainer Froese and colleagues through the Minderoo Project.

The Data Science Specialist will: 1) review empirical data and algorithms applied to the price, end-use, fishing effort and layer 3 databases and develop code that imputes missing data to complete gaps in these databases associated with reconstructed catches; 2) investigate the 2022 update of reconstructed catches to identify patterns (which might apply AI) in the catch trends that might be used towards projecting future trends that might help in automating future reconstruction updates; 3) propose novel ways of summarizing Sea Around Us data or identify elements that are the most needed by users and develop views to these elements in collaboration with the Sea Around Us Website and Database Specialist; 4) conceive and develop novel ways of analyzing the Sea Around Us datasets in close collaboration with the PI and Research Unit Manager; 5) 6)participate in the development of spatialized components to map distribution of species and allocated reconstructed catches; and 6) participate in the allocation of reconstructed catches to half degree cells.

The ideal candidate should have extensive experience with working with large datasets (over 1 billion rows) on fisheries and biological life history traits and be familiar with statistical and mathematical derivations of empirical datasets. The candidate will also be required to have good knowledge of the Sea Around Us infrastructure and the principles behind this infrastructure, and a working knowledge of several languages such as PostGres, MS Excel, JavaScript, Python, C# and R. It is important for the candidate to be adept with QGIS and PostGIS. The ideal candidate should be able to implement ideas and tasks requested by the PI and delegate specific data-related tasks to Sea Around Us teams. The Data Science Specialist will be working in close collaboration with the Website and Database Specialist in order to maintain operations, integrity, troubleshooting and maintenance of the Sea Around Us tech stack.

ORGANIZATIONAL STATUS

Reporting directly to the Project Manager, Dr Maria L.D. Palomares, and as required to the Principal Investigator, Dr. Daniel Pauly, the Data Science Specialist works independently under minimal supervision. The Data Science Specialist oversees and trains coding members of the Sea Around Us. Acts as a consultant to external research facilities including local, national and international collaborators.

WORK PERFORMED

Manages underlying algorithms of the Sea Around Us (catch, price, end-use, domestic, foreign and high seas catches), which might also be useful for website applications, database and system infrastructure.

Plan, design, develop, and implement novel algorithms or analyses or ways of visualizing Sea Around Us datasets.

Supervise, train and instruct research assistants with new algorithms or database features.

Job Description

What is the opportunity?

RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from NLP-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.

The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.

What will you do?


Application: You will have the opportunity to work in any of the many areas we work in, across an even wider variety of business functions.
Validation: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility & stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
Research & Development: You will read research papers (established work and state-of-the-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
IT: You will collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.


What do you need to succeed?

Must-have


Passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with research and technology
Strong communication and interpersonal skills
Progress towards a PhD or Master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Engineering, Quantitative Finance, or a related quantitative field
Proficient programming skills in Python or a similar language; you should already be comfortable with writing research experiments and be willing to learn how to write clean code.
Familiarity with popular machine learning frameworks and libraries


Nice-to-have


A risk-oriented mindset: You are curious about the “how” as well as the “why""
Publication or prior research experience (applied or fundamental)
Experience with version control systems
Comfortable with command line tools


What’s in it for you?

We thrive on the challenge to be our best, progressive thinking to keep growing, and working together to deliver trusted advice to help our clients thrive and communities prosper. We care about each other, reaching our potential, making a difference to our communities, and achieving success that is mutual.


A comprehensive Total Rewards Program including bonuses and flexible benefits, competitive compensation, commissions, and stock where applicable
Leaders who support your development through coaching and managing opportunities
Ability to make a difference and lasting impact
Work in a dynamic, collaborative, progressive, and high-performing team
A world-class training program in financial services
Flexible work/life balance options
Opportunities to do challenging work

At Mogo, we’re building the future of finance through bold innovation and AI-native platforms. This role is part of our Intelligent Investing team.

Build the Future of Wealth - With Intention

Intelligent Investing isn’t about layering AI onto fintech, it’s about reimagining the entire system, where every decision, feature, and line of code reflects clarity, discipline, and long-term thinking.

This isn’t another trading app chasing dopamine. We’re building the opposite:


A platform where restraint is a feature
Where AI isn’t a gimmick, it’s the foundation
Where compounding meets conviction


Our mission is simple: Help a new generation build wealth through intelligence, not impulse.

Why This Role?

We're hiring a small group of high-upside junior engineers to help us build the future of disciplined, AI-native investing. You’ll be working directly with senior builders on:


A full-stack architecture designed for speed, elegance, and scale
AI-native flows that reinforce behavior, not engagement
Advanced feature sets (including crypto and options) gated by process, not hype


You’ll be building product at the intersection of:


Behavioral finance
Responsible crypto innovation
AI systems that think like investors, not algorithms chasing clicks


Who This Is For


You write code with intention, not just speed
You’re obsessed with clean design, thoughtful UX, and systems that don’t shout
You’re not looking to ship more features, you’re looking to build something that lasts
You respect Buffett more than Reddit
You want to work at a company where AI is the engine, not the garnish


What You’ll Work On


Full-stack development across our investing platform
AI-driven interfaces that embed discipline into user flows
Back-end systems that are fast, simple, and scalable
Tools that help real people make better long-term decisions


What We’re Looking For


0–3 years of professional experience (or projects that show you're ready)
Proficiency with modern JS frameworks (React, Next.js) and API development
Curiosity about AI/ML, crypto infrastructure, and behavioral systems
Strong design instincts and a clean aesthetic
Humility, hunger, and a high standard for your work


What We Offer


A rare chance to help build a high-integrity product from the ground up
Senior mentorship and exposure to world-class investors and operators
Small team, zero politics, big impact
Full remote flexibility across Canada
A portfolio you’ll be proud of, for years
Comprehensive Health and Wellness - Access medical, dental, and vision coverage plus a Health Spending Account
Stock Options - Have a stake in the company's success through stock options
Flex Vacation - Benefit from paid time off, including vacation days, holidays, and personal days
Wellbeing Programs - Access counselling services, mental health support, and additional wellness resources


This is not just an engineering role. It’s a bet on your future, and ours.

If that sounds like the right kind of pressure, step inside.

Benefits of working with us:


ALWAYS FULLY REMOTE WORK - Enjoy the flexibility of remote work, supported by necessary resources
Comprehensive Health and Wellness - Access medical, dental, and vision coverage plus a Health Spending Account
Stock Options - Have a stake in the company's success through stock options
Flex Vacation - Benefit from paid time off, including vacation days, holidays, and personal days
Wellbeing Programs - Access counselling services, mental health support, and additional wellness resources


About Us:

We help make it easy for Canadians to achieve financial freedom while making a positive impact.

We live in the most innovative and technologically advanced era, yet so much struggle exists. Most of us are far from where we want to be financially.

We all want a better future. A better world where reaching financial freedom is a question of when, not if. One that's equitable so that all can prosper. One that's safe from the impact of climate change.

Our money has the power to change the world. It’s up to us to do things differently.

Apply today! Do you know anyone who would be a great fit for this role or other roles on our career page? Please share this job posting with them! Mogo is an inclusive place to spend your work life. We hire team members for their talent and diverse backgrounds. Bring your unique perspective to Mogo and help our customers achieve their best financial lives.

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale
