Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra's ability to achieve its mission is determined by our ability to work together — as defined by our core values: Transparency, Collaboration, Operational Excellence, Ownership, and Empathy. We seek individuals who embody these values, as they are instrumental in ensuring our team consistently delivers excellence and fosters an engaging and supportive culture

Phaidra is based in the USA, but we are 100% remote with no physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, and India.

          <strong>About Phaidra<br><br></strong>Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.<br><br>The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.<br><br>Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:<br><br><ul><li>We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.</li><li>We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.</li><li>We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.<br><br></li></ul>Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.<br><br>Phaidra's ability to achieve its mission is determined by our ability to work together — as defined by our core values: <strong>Transparency</strong>, <strong>Collaboration</strong>, <strong>Operational Excellence</strong>, <strong>Ownership</strong>, and <strong>Empathy.</strong> We seek individuals who embody these values, as they are instrumental in ensuring our team consistently delivers excellence and fosters an engaging and supportive culture<br><br>Phaidra is based in the USA, but we are 100% remote with no physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, and India.<br><br><strong>Who You Are<br><br></strong>Phaidra is looking for a creative and pragmatic Machine Learning Engineer to join our research team.

Annual Base Pay $176,600 - $225,900 USD

When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. and/or Canada locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.

Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday (for non-exempt employees), plus a day off for their birthday. Non-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco’s flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco’s Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.

Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows


75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;


1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;

1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.

Splunk, a Cisco company, is an Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis.

We are training foundation models from scratch, designing new reasoning architectures, and deploying them on state-of-the-art GPU clusters. This is not fine-tuning someone else’s work. This is building from first principles.

As an AI/ML Engineer, you’ll be part of the team that makes this real. You’ll work on both sides of the problem: how models are trained and how they run in the world. You’ll design and build the systems that power large-scale training runs and efficient inference. You’ll work closely with our AI Researchers to implement the latest algorithms and ideas.

This is a deep engineering role. You’ll be writing a lot of code, instrumenting systems, optimizing performance, and debugging weird, messy edge cases in distributed training and model serving. If you love figuring out how foundation models really work under the hood, this is your team.

We’re expanding our global network of Maincoders by establishing a new Seattle office. Join us in shaping this hub from day one while collaborating closely with our Melbourne headquarters to push forward the frontier of AI research and engineering.

What You’ll Do


Build and scale training pipelines for sovereign foundation models like large language models and other architectures
Design efficient inference systems that run these models in real-world environments
Optimize data pipelines, tokenization, batch prep, and distributed training at multi-node scale
Build deep observability into training and inference, improving performance, correctness, and efficiency
Debug and troubleshoot the hardest parts of model training and deployment, including distributed failures, GPU bugs, data inconsistencies, and scaling limits
Work closely with AI Researchers to translate cutting-edge algorithms into working systems
Establish strong ModelOps practices to ensure reproducibility, reliability, and continuous improvement across the full lifecycle of foundation models, from initial experiments to production deployment


Who You Are


Passionate about how models are built, trained, and run, especially large-scale foundation models
Driven by curiosity about model internals, training dynamics, and system-level performance
Excited to work across both training and inference, not just one side of the ML stack
Skilled in Python and ML frameworks like PyTorch or JAX. Familiarity with distributed compute (CUDA, Triton, NCCL, etc.) is a bonus but not required
Constantly learning, whether it’s reading open-source repos, replicating research ideas, or designing your own tools to explore a problem
Hands-on and determined. You like writing code, running experiments, and figuring things out
Motivated to help build sovereign AI capability here in Australia


Why Maincode

We are a small team building some of the most advanced AI systems in Australia. We are creating new foundation models from scratch, not just using what’s already out there.

We operate our own GPU clusters, run large-scale training, and work closely across research and engineering to push the frontier of what’s possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who:


Care about model internals, not just outputs
Build things that work, at scale
Take pride in learning, experimenting, and shipping
Want to help Australia build independent, world-class AI systems


Compensation Range: A$150K - A$180K

About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Applications for this position will be accepted on an ongoing basis.

Slack is looking for a Staff and Senior level Machine Learning Engineers to craft and implement features, services, API methods, and models to leverage our data to make Slack a fabulous, robust, safe, and valuable product for our users. We work on applications across summarization, recommendation, ranking, and security, but ultimately are looking for engineers who can help drive impact with machine learning across the organization.

At Slack, your impact can be huge:


We have over 10 million daily active users relying on our product.
At peak usage, a million messages a minute pass through Slack.
During the week, our users spend over a billion minutes a day active in our product.


Machine Learning engineers at Slack touch a great variety of parts of our technical stack. At different points, you might find yourself building data pipelines, training recommendation models, fine tuning LLMs, implementing features in our application, or analyzing experiment data. We don’t expect everyone to be an expert in everything, but we are looking for candidates with experience in Machine Learning, a strength in at least a couple of these, and who are excited to learn the rest.

This is a practical Machine Learning team, not a research team. Our goal is to deliver business value with machine learning and data in whatever form that takes. Sometimes that means bootstrapping something simple like a logistic regression and moving on. Other times that means developing sophisticated, finely tuned models and novel solutions to Slack’s unique problem space. We are looking for engineers who are driven by driving impact for our business, building great products for our customers, and delivering robust, reliable services with machine learning.

What you will be doing:


Develop ML models supporting ranking, retrieval, and generative AI use-cases.
Brainstorm with Product Managers, Designers and Frontend Engineers to conceptualize and build new features for our large (and growing!) user base.
Produce high-quality results by leading or contributing heavily to large multi-functional projects that have a significant impact on the business.
Actively own features or systems and define their long-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
Support in the development of sustainable data collection pipelines and management of ML features.
Assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving production issues.
Mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.


What you should have:


7+ years of applicable engineering experience.
Experience with functional or imperative programming languages: PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, C, Scala or Java.
Built with common ML frameworks like pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, XGBoost, or Scikit-learn
Experience building batch data processing pipelines with tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, EMR, Map Reduce, Airflow, Dagster, or Luigi.
Worked on generative AI apps with Large Language Models and possibly fine tuned them
An analytical and data driven mindset, and know how to measure success with complicated ML/AI products.
Put machine learning models or other data-derived artifacts into production at scale.
Experience leading technical architecture discussions and helped drive technical decisions within the team.
The ability to write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
Strong communication skills and you are capable of explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other specialists.
Strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.


Nice to have:


Expertise in retrieval systems and search algorithms.
Familiarity with vector databases and embeddings.
Knowledge of using multiple data types in RAG solutions including structured, unstructured, and knowledge graphs.
Broad experience across NLP, ML, and Generative AI capabilities.

Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.<br><br>In the United States, compensation offered will be determined by factors such as location, job level, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. Certain roles may be eligible for incentive compensation, equity, and benefits. Salesforce offers a variety of benefits to help you live well including: time off programs, medical, dental, vision, mental health support, paid parental leave, life and disability insurance, 401(k), and an employee stock purchasing program.

Every business is powered by contracts, but managing them can slow companies down and cost millions of dollars. Global innovators like L’Oréal, OpenAI, and Salesforce trust Ironclad to transform contracting into a strategic advantage - accelerating revenue, reducing risk, and driving efficiency. It’s the only platform that manages every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement or a complex NDA.

We’re building the future of intelligent contracting and writing the narrative for how contracts unlock strategic growth. Forrester Wave and Gartner Magic Quadrant have consistently recognized Ironclad as a leader in our category. We’ve also been named one of Fortune’s Great Places to Work six years running, featured on Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work, and recognized by Forbes’ 50 Most Promising AI Companies.

We’re backed by leading investors like Accel, Sequoia, Y Combinator, and BOND. We’d love for you to join us!

About The Role

Ironclad is accelerating its investment in AI to redefine how legal teams manage and understand contracts. As part of this effort, we are hiring an AI Evaluation Engineer to work within our AI Pillar. This role is focused on unlocking insights from our training data, designing feedback loops, and ensuring the continuous improvement of our agentic and ML or LLM-based systems through data-driven evaluation and iteration.

You’ll partner closely with AI Engineers and Product Managers to drive better model quality through systematic analysis, experimentation, and the curation of high-leverage datasets. Your work will directly impact the effectiveness of features like Smart Import, contract understanding, and agentic workflows.

What You'll Be Doing


Analyze training and evaluation datasets to identify distributional gaps, labeling inconsistencies, and long-tail opportunities.
Design and execute labeling campaigns, including development of golden datasets and annotation guidelines.
Build and maintain dashboards that track model accuracy, regression trends, and product-specific KPIs like success rate or answer helpfulness.
Investigate failure modes via prompt clustering, error taxonomy development, and user intent classification.
Operationalize feedback loops: mine product telemetry and human-in-the-loop reviews for signal, then translate into data-driven model improvement strategies.
Partner with engineers and PMs to run structured A/B tests and human evaluations for new models or features.
Support the development of scalable data and evaluation infrastructure for LLMs and agents.
Work with product, engineering and legal to create clear & transparent processes for the handling of customer data in AI training, fine-tuning and evaluation


About You


Bachelor's or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science, Applied Math).
1–3 years of experience in applied ML or data science, preferably in NLP or LLM-based applications.
Strong SQL and Python skills; experience with Jupyter, Pandas, and experiment tracking tools.
Comfortable navigating ambiguity, slicing large datasets, and communicating insights clearly to cross-functional stakeholders.
Experience with prompt analysis, clustering, or user behavior modeling is a plus.
Bonus: familiarity with LLM eval techniques, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or agentic system design.Experience with program management.


Why This Role Matters

AI is critical to the value Ironclad customers get from their contracts, allowing their business to manage risk, close revenue faster and operate more effectively. None of this is possible without reliable and accurate data. This role will lead these efforts, becoming a key contributor to the development of AI solutions in an industry that is likely to be transformed by the new generation of models.

What We Value


Bias for action and data curiosity
Ownership mindset and team-first attitude
Comfort in fast-paced, iterative environments
Passion for building AI products that solve real-world customer problems

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

You Will:



Analyze and evaluate policy and program changes that affect how creators are paid
Own reporting and insights related to payout eligibility, earning, and program performance
Partner with cross-functional stakeholders to inform product and business decisions
Write, maintain, and validate pipelines to support recurring analytics and reporting
Apply causal inference methods to estimate the impact of payout changes



You Have:



1+ years of experience as a data scientist, data analyst, or a related field
Proficiency in SQL
Proficiency with Python or R
Understanding of Causal Inference concepts (ex/ DiD, matching, IPW, experiment design)
Strong communication skills across technical and non-technical stakeholders
High level of comfort creating dashboards



Bonus Points



Hands-on experience with Airflow, Sagemaker or deploying ML models in production environments
Strong familiarity with econometrics
Contribute to machine learning efforts in fraud or churn prediction
Experience Ideating, executing, and analyzing A/B tests.



Perks



Medical, Dental, Vision & Disability Insurance
401(k)
Maternity & Parental Leave

We’re looking for a highly motivated engineer with experience deploying machine learning algorithms to physical systems in the real world.

The ideal candidate has hands-on experience in perception (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation) and/or behavior learning methods (e.g., Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, diffusion policies). More importantly, you’ve shipped ML models to robots in production environments, and you understand the complexities that come with it.

What you’ll do:


Develop and optimize real-time ML models for edge deployment on robotic systems
Work with vendors to label data and build robust data extraction and labeling pipelines
Design custom metrics to evaluate model performance in the field
Reduce model latency using tools like ONNX, TensorRT, or similar


What we’re looking for:


Practical experience applying machine learning with deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to solve real-world problems
Proficiency in Python and comfort with at least one systems language (e.g., C++, Rust)
Experience deploying ML models to robotic systems or other physical platforms
Experience incorporating raw sensor data like camera, lidar, radar, IMUs, etc into deep learning algorithms.
Bonus: Practical application of incorporating 3D geometry into deep learning models
Bonus: Published work in conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, We’re especially interested in engineers who thrive at the intersection of ML research and real-world robotics applications.


Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

We’re looking for a Growth ML & Experimentation Engineer to build Ava’s adaptive growth brain: systems that run millions of microtests and optimize outbound performance across companies, personas, and industries.

Think of this role as creating the “growth hacker” mind inside our AI BDR—combining A/B testing, reinforcement learning, and control systems at scale.

You’ll be building an AI that adapts itself to every persona, every market, and every trend—without needing to be told. This isn’t growth hacking for a website. It’s evolution for an AI employee.

What You'll Do


Design and implement automated experimentation systems (A/Z testing, multivariate optimization, Bayesian exploration, etc).
Build dynamic systems that continuously learn from open/response rates, meetings booked, and downstream metrics.
Create reinforcement loops and scoring models to help Ava adjust tone, targeting, and strategies in real-time.
Work closely with product to embed experimentation directly into the AI-user experience.
Develop tools to visualize and interpret campaign intelligence for internal teams and end users.


What You Bring


3–6+ years of experience in applied ML, ideally focused on growth, optimization, or adaptive systems.
Experience with online experimentation frameworks (A/B testing infra, bandits, causal inference, etc).
Strong Python and data engineering skills; comfortable working across pipelines, APIs, and backend systems.
Experience working with outbound or marketing funnel data is a major plus.
Passion for building intelligent systems that get better every day, without human micromanagement.


Why Join Us


Build the future of work by pioneering a new AI-native product category.
Collaborate with a mission-driven, ambitious, and high-caliber team.
Competitive salary, generous equity, and full benefits.
Regular company off-sites and team events.
Fast-moving culture where you'll ship meaningful work every week.

We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on behavior learning, specifically data-driven behavior policies and robust data infrastructure. In this role, you'll be responsible for developing and scaling state-of-the-art learning architectures, while also building the data systems that make these models reliable, scalable, and reproducible in production.

What you’ll do:


Design, train, validate, and launch models for behavior cloning and reinforcement learning
Build and maintain data ingestion, labeling, and management pipelines to ensure high-quality training datasets
Build metrics to evaluate model performance in open loop, simulation, and in the real world
Collaborate with simulation, systems, and infrastructure teams to integrate ML models into real-world autonomous systems
Deploy and debug these models in real-world environments, addressing practical issues such as latency, hardware constraints, and system integration


What we’re looking for:


Practical experience applying machine learning with deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to solve real-world problems
Proficiency in Python and comfort with at least one systems language (e.g., C++, Rust)
Familiarity with recent literature and methods in learned behavior policies
Practical experience in behavior cloning and/or reinforcement learning
Bonus: Experience with diffusion policies, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, or related technologies
Bonus: Published work in conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, …


Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market.

About The Job

The premium experience for YouTube users involves no ads, backgrounding, downloads (for offline experiences), and many others. The role focuses on understanding and quantifying user behavior that violates the YouTube Premium terms-of-service (ToS). Several streaming services have been cracking down on abuse, and in some cases have seen growth in legit accounts following the crackdown. On YouTube Premium, there are several aspects to premium abuse: creator payout abuse, family plan and cross-border abuse and google account sharing. Each involves developing signals, methods and models that will be used to identify cases where there is a high probability of ToS violations. Further, this analyst will help develop processes for and support enforcement.

Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun — and we do it all together.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $141,000-$202,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training.

We are looking for engineers with expertise in shipping production 3D perception systems at scale. Successful candidates have architected systems, trained models from scratch, understand the full stack (clustering, detection, classification, and tracking), and have shipped at scale. We use both computer vision and LIDAR-based approaches, so knowledge of either or both is key. Models are just part of the system: you understand data and have good intuition about why models fail. You know how to eval for corner cases, manage or build data pipelines, use autolabels (or not), and have a strong understanding of statistical properties of these systems.

Our perception system is a core element in safeguarding the people, vehicles, and projects we work on. The system is central to ensuring that as we scale less traditional learning approaches, that the system is always safe. You have a passion for rigor and safety.

The role is best suited for a hands-on engineer who has shipped perception systems into the real world, and is interested in building the right system with modern approaches from scratch. You will need to articulate a clear vision of a modern perception system, and how to train and evaluate it efficiently and quickly. Join us!

Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

We are always looking for opportunities to improve. Our mission is to demystify marketing with insights grounded in data, telling the story of how we attract and retain our users to teams, to senior management, and to the community.

What’s this team like at Etsy?

The Marketing Analytics team is responsible for helping drive the success of marketing efforts at Etsy by providing meaningful insights, industry-leading measurement techniques, and access to the metrics, data, and tools needed for decision-making and optimization.

We partner with our peers in marketing, analytics, research, product, engineering, and finance through all stages of development: identifying initial opportunities, refining the user experience, analyzing the impact of our efforts, and highlighting improvement areas. Ultimately, the team’s work strengthens Etsy and helps continuously improve the Etsy experience.

What does the day-to-day look like?


Develop, implement, and refine core marketing measurement frameworks and models, including attribution, churn, CLV, return on investment, experiment methodology, and segmentation.
Drive forward strategy for performance marketing partners by transforming raw data into meaningful and impactful analyses characterized by strong data governance, technique clarity, and clear documentation.
Play a foundational role in deciding how we can best engage and grow Etsy users by determining and helping prioritize opportunities for growth through analysis of behavioral and transactional data.
Identify key metrics that drive the performance of marketing channels and marketing products, make these accessible to partners through dashboards and reports, and drive these metrics through statistical analyses of experiments.
Continually evaluate and refine your technical toolkit, sharing what you learn with the team.
Of course, this is just a sample of the kinds of work this role will require! You should assume that your role will encompass other tasks, too, and that your job duties and responsibilities may change from time to time at Etsy's discretion, or otherwise applicable with local law.


Qualities that will help you thrive in this role are:

Experience with performance/digital marketing operations, channel attribution, churn and lifetime value models, analytical tools and infrastructure, and finding efficient growth strategies a plus.
Experience working with Creators or on Creator marketing is a plus.
Proficient in SQL and either R or Python.
Proven ability to communicate your insights verbally, visually, and in writing with teammates and business partners.
Comfortable guiding others, recommending tools and standard methodologies to improve the efficiency of the teams work.

PayPal has been revolutionizing commerce globally for more than 25 years. Creating innovative experiences that make moving money, selling, and shopping simple, personalized, and secure, PayPal empowers consumers and businesses in approximately 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.

We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects hundreds of millions of merchants and consumers. We help merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our platform on behalf of our customers.

We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts.

At Artisan, we’re building real AI employees - not copilots, not assistants, but autonomous teammates.

Our first, Ava, is an AI BDR. She finds and researches leads, writes emails in customers’ tone of voice, runs outbound sequences, self-optimizes, and manages email deliverability infrastructure. She learns, adapts, and improves over time - just like a human would.

Human team members use Artisan as their primary working platform, replacing a sprawling stack of sales tools, and have Artisans working alongside them.

We went through Y Combinator (W24) and have raised $35M+ from top investors. We’re at $6M+ ARR, with hundreds of customers including Remote, Quora, and SumUp.

We’re currently working on Ava 2.0, pushing the boundaries of what an AI employee can do. And we're hiring.

About The Role

Artisans interact with people millions of times each month and we collect a massive amount of data. This is a unique opportunity to build self-optimization capabilities at scale:


Design and deploy systems for multivariate testing, Bayesian optimization, and online learning to optimize messaging, targeting, and sequencing
Build models that adapt on the fly, learning from user behavior to improve campaign performance in real time
Develop lead and persona scoring frameworks that help Ava decide who to reach out to, when, and how
Create models that adjust Ava’s tone, strategy, and targeting based on live campaign feedback - without human input
Work closely with Product to bake experimentation directly into Ava’s UX and decision logic


What You Bring


3–6+ years of ML experience, ideally focused on growth, recommendation engines, optimization, or adaptive systems
Experience with online experimentation frameworks (A/B testing infra, bandits, causal inference, etc)
Strong Python and data engineering skills; comfortable working across pipelines, APIs, and backend systems
Experience working with marketing funnel data is a major plus
Passion for building intelligent systems that get better every day, without human micromanagement


Why Join Us


A unique opportunity to work on the development of AI employees which will interact with 10s of millions of people
Extremely competitive compensation and full benefits
Flexibility and autonomy to run experiments and try new things
Collaborate with a mission-driven, ambitious, and extremely talented team
Fast-moving culture where you'll ship meaningful work every week

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market.

About Wealthfront




Here at Wealthfront, our mission is to create a financial system that favors people, not institutions. We do this by leveraging technology to build powerful, low-cost, and easy-to-use financial products that help modern investors grow and manage their money.




We started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business. By automating strategies typically reserved for the wealthy, we unlocked access to high quality investment advice for a digitally-native generation that was underserved by traditional institutions. Since then, we've expanded to a full suite of products designed to help our clients turn their savings into long-term wealth, including:




• A Cash Account that, through our partner banks, offers one of the highest annual percentage yields on uninvested cash in the industry, while providing instant and secure access to your money with no account fees and a full suite of checking features.




• A zero-commission Stock Investing Account with 50+ handpicked collections that help DIY investors discover new companies and make smarter investing decisions.




• Multiple automated investing portfolios designed to unlock tax savings through sophisticated strategies like fixed income, tax-loss harvesting, and direct indexing—which we offer at industry-leading low costs and accessible minimums.




Our award-winning products have attracted over 1 million clients who trust us with more than $85 billion of their hard earned savings—and we're far from done. If you’re inspired to help us reshape the financial industry as we create our next chapter, let’s talk!

Imprint is reimagining co-branded credit cards & financial products to be smarter, more rewarding, and truly brand-first. We partner with companies like H-E-B, Turkish Airlines, Brooks Brothers, and Eddie Bauer to launch modern credit programs that deepen loyalty, unlock savings, and drive growth. Our platform combines advanced payments infrastructure, intelligent underwriting, and seamless UX to help brands offer powerful financial products—without becoming a bank.

Co-branded cards account for over $300 billion in U.S. annual spend—but most are still powered by legacy banks.
