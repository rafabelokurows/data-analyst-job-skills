About us:

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The best choice for anyone who takes investing seriously:

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

The system would detect colorimetric images and predict with a high level of accuracy discrete pH values, delivering lab-quality diagnostic precision to women and doctors - anytime, anywhere!


Tasks


To make pHera robust and scalable, pHera is looking for a computer vision and machine learning engineer to design and implement the complete computer-vision pipeline: from image capture, colour detection and pH prediction.





Implement computer vision algorithms for color detection from captured images


Integrate machine learning models for accurate pH prediction based colour detection


Ensure performance across different smartphone devices and lighting conditions





Applicants who clearly outline in thier cover letter how they would implement these three tasks will be prioritised.


Requirements



Based in Berlin


Eager to work in an early-stage, science-driven, female health startup


Comfortable with ambiguity, self-directed, and proactive



Benefits


Flexibility: choose freelance, part-time or full-time




Hybrid work environment with office space in Berlin




A competitive salary for 6 months with the possibility of extension




pHera is closing the gender health gap!

Most existing vaginal pH test strips are analog, low-resolution, visually subjective, and

poorly suited for women’s health applications. Doctors need fast, reliable tools to

help with complicated diagnoses. Women deserve clarity, not guesswork when

managing their vaginal health from home. A high-resolution pH test can catch

imbalances early, making it easier to monitor issues like bacterial vaginosis,

recurring vaginal infections, sexually transmitted infections, ovulation, PCOS, and

menopause. By building pHera, you would be building a tool that would advance women's health.

Main tasks and responsibilities:


Research, prototype, and validate novel statistical methods for A/B testing and causal inference relevant to Bolt's challenges.
Develop PoCs for new methodologies, working closely with our two dedicated data engineers to support moving successful concepts into production.
Drive the democratization of experimentation by improving self-serve tooling, developing educational materials, and providing direct consultation to product teams.
Collaborate closely with engineers and product managers to translate advanced statistical methods into robust, scalable platform features used by hundreds of people across Bolt.
Work closely with Data Science and Analyst teams across all verticals to prioritize your research agenda and drive experimentation best practices throughout the company.
Effectively communicate complex statistical concepts and experiment results to stakeholders of different levels of data literacy when needed, from Data Scientists and Analysts, to Product Managers, Engineers, and leadership.



About you:


2+ years of experience working in the tech industry in a Data Scientist/Analyst or Economist role
Be able to translate novel methods from research papers on experimentation and causal inference into PoCs.
Deep understanding and practical application of Statistical Hypothesis Testing and A/B Testing / Randomized Controlled Trials (including advanced techniques).
Strong stakeholder management skills, notably collaborating with and influencing Data Scientists and Analysts.
Proficiency in R or Python (we work in Python, but this can be acquired) and SQL.
Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.
Accelerate your professional growth with unique career opportunities.
Get a rewarding salary and stock option package that lets you focus on doing your best work.
Enjoy the flexibility of working in a hybrid mode with a minimum of 3 days in the office each week to foster strong connections and teamwork.
Take care of your physical and mental health with our wellness perks.
Some perks may differ depending on your location and role.

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

selecting features, building and optimizing classifiers using machine learning techniques
processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
deep dive on the problems using SQL and scripting languages to drive solutions leveraging Statistical Analysis
implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone. Our recruitment process is free from discrimination of any kind — including on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between.

A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Backed by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, the IPA, and Sky, Barb has been the source of official TV viewing figures for decades. 




Barb is uniquely placed to empower transformation of the UK TV and advertising ecosystem through reliable and accurate data.  




These data fulfil three purposes:  




To support decisions that are made in the making and distribution of great programmes.  
To support the planning and buying of ad campaigns and informing on brand and sales outcomes.  
To inform how broadcasters and other media services operate in the public interest. 




As the media industry evolves, so does Barb. We've expanded our measurement beyond traditional panels to incorporate large-scale online data and streaming services. Through our campaign reporting tools, Barb also provides the full picture of cross-platform pre and post campaign reporting. 




Our hybrid approach combines people-based panel data with census-level device data to deliver inclusive measurement of total identified viewing across all platforms, services, and devices. This empowers broadcasters, advertisers, and regulators to make more better, fairer, more informed decisions. 




Overview 

We’re seeking a Junior Data Scientist to help build the future of UK audience measurement. This is a unique opportunity to join a small, expert team of 13, reporting directly to the Head of Data Science and working on foundational systems used by major media organisations across the UK. 




You can expect to work on high-impact projects including: 




The Barb Data Hub, a centralised Snowflake data warehouse serving as the single source of truth for Barb data. You’ll help develop a library of reusable analysis tools. 
Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Sharing – ensuring users can apply Barb’s complex methodologies efficiently and accurately. 
Barb Panel Plus, a new system integrating “return path data” from TV sets and set-top boxes with existing panel data. 




These projects pose exciting challenges from the point of view of data engineering, statistical modelling, and software development. This role will be of interest to someone starting their career as a data scientist and excited by the prospect of finding brilliant solutions to these problems. The role would be well-suited to someone who is a talented coder, logical thinker, enjoys working with data, has an interest in the TV industry, and is looking to grow into their career as a data scientist. 




Key responsibilities 




Work closely with the Barb executive team and partners to understand and implement the Barb Calculation Methodology, which is a complex set of conventions and algorithms that describe how to use Barb panel data to calculate standard audience metrics. 
Build and maintain a shared library of reusable data analysis tools for Barb’s users and suppliers. 
Support users of Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Share, ensuring they produce correct and industry-standard outputs. 
Translate parts of the methodology into reliable, production-ready Python code for use across Barb’s systems. 
Contribute to the evaluation and development of statistical and machine learning models for return path data integration. 
Develop ELT pipelines and modelling solutions for data integration projects. 

 




Qualifications 




A degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., STEM, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics). 
Good working knowledge of Python and SQL. 
Experience with Python data packages (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) preferred. 
Strong mathematical and statistical foundation. 
Ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with others. 

 

Experience 




The ideal candidate will have some experience with: 

Data engineering; working with databases, building infrastructure for moving, storing, and processing data.  
Modelling; analysing data using statistical or machine-learning techniques 




Preferred: 

Experience with Snowflake, or other cloud data platforms such as Databricks or BigQuery. 
Familiarity with Snowpark or similar distributed computing frameworks such as Spark. 

For graduates, the above could include projects done at university or during an internship. 




 




Benefits 




Base salary will reflect the responsibilities of the role and be commensurate with experience. Barb offers a discretionary bonus scheme alongside the following benefits. 




Office in central London – with hybrid working options 
Pension contributions up to a maximum of 9% of salary — employees’ contribution matched +3% 
Five weeks paid holiday — rising to six weeks after 10 years’ service 
Holiday purchase scheme — purchase up to five additional days in any calendar year 
Group Life Assurance — four times annual salary 
Group Income Protection — 75% of salary after 26 weeks absence 
Enhanced pay for parental/adoption leave after 18 months of service — 13 weeks at 100% of basic salary followed by 26 weeks at the statutory rate

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Role Overview:

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences

Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

What you'll be doing:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience

Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:

Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry


Benefits:

We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC)

Wage: Between $86-$130 an hour

Licensed Professional Counselor — Are you ready to launch or expand your private practice? Headway is here to help you start accepting insurance with ease, increase your earnings with higher rates, and start taking covered clients sooner. It’s all on one free-to-use platform, no commitment required.

About You


You’re a fully-licensed Professional Counselor at a Master’s level or above with LPC, LPCC, LCPC, LCPCS, LPCC-S licensure (accepted on a state by state basis), a valid NPI number, and malpractice insurance.
You’re ready to launch a private practice, or grow your existing business by taking insurance.


About Headway

Your expertise changes lives. Taking insurance makes it accessible to those who need it most. Every mental health provider who goes in-network with Headway supports people who’d otherwise be forced to choose between paying out of pocket, or not getting care at all. We make that process seamless — empowering you to accept insurance with ease, so you can do what you do best. So far, we’ve helped over 50,000 providers grow their practices, reaching countless people in need.

How Headway Supports Providers


Start taking insurance, stress-free: Get credentialed for free in multiple states in as little as 30 days and start seeing covered clients sooner.
Built-in compliance : Stay compliant from day one with audit support and ongoing resources.
Expansive coverage: Work with the plans that most clients use, including Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.
Increase your earnings: Secure higher rates with top insurance plans through access to our nationwide insurance network.
Dependable payments: Build stability in your practice with predictable bi-weekly payments you can count on.
Built-in EHR features : Manage your practice in one place with real-time scheduling, secure client messaging, end-to-end documentation templates, built-in assessments, and more.
Free continuing education : Nurture your long-term professional goals and earn CEUs with complimentary courses on Headway Academy.


How Headway Supports Your Clients


Increased access: Headway makes it easier for your clients to get the care they need at a price they can afford through insurance.
Instant verification: Clients can easily check their insurance status and get the care they need without disruption.


Please note: At this time, Headway can’t support mental health professionals that aren’t fully licensed. If your application was rejected for incomplete licensure, you’re welcome to reapply once you have a valid license.

About Headway

We make it easy for mental health providers to take insurance by credentialing you with the nation’s largest networks, handling billing and admin paperwork, and helping you earn more stable income with higher rates. With Headway, you can finally focus on what matters most: providing life-changing care. We’ll take care of the rest.

We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

You own end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and transformation to model training, validation, and online inference. You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

What You’ll Do


Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.




About the Role:




We're seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to bridge the gap between our data products, data science insights and production systems. You'll be responsible for taking ML models from concept to production, building robust MLOps infrastructure, and ensuring our machine learning systems operate reliably at scale. This role focuses on the engineering aspects of ML design, deployment, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure.




What you will do:




Design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion to model serving
Build automated model training, validation, and deployment workflows using CI/CD best practices
Develop and maintain MLOps infrastructure for model versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment
Create robust monitoring and alerting systems for model performance, data drift, and system health
Optimize model inference performance and cost for production workloads
Collaborate with our Data Engineers to design and implement feature stores and feature pipelines
Develop automated data quality checks and validation frameworks for ML pipelines
Build scalable feature engineering workflows that support both batch and real-time inference
Implement data versioning and lineage tracking for reproducible ML workflows
Partner with Software Data Scientists to productionize research models and experiments
Implement frameworks for model evaluation and gradual rollouts
Design automated retraining pipelines and model refresh strategies
Establish best practices for model governance, documentation, and compliance
Work closely with Software Engineers to integrate ML capabilities into existing applications
Contribute to architectural decisions for scalable, maintainable ML systems
Participate in code reviews, documentation, and knowledge sharing across teams
Mentor junior engineers on ML engineering best practices




The right person for this role will have:




3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, MLOps, or related fields
Strong proficiency in Python for ML development and automation
Solid SQL skills for data manipulation and analysis
Hands-on experience with AWS or other cloud platforms (Azure, or GCP) and their ML services
Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for ML workloads
Proficiency with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and MLOps tools
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code principles
Databricks experience is a plus
Experience with feature engineering at scale and feature store implementations
Understanding of model monitoring, observability, and production ML challenges
Knowledge of data quality frameworks and automated testing for ML systems
Familiarity with distributed computing frameworks (Databricks or Sagemaker) for large-scale ML
Experience with experiment tracking and model versioning tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases, etc.)




Bonus points if you have:




Master's or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or related quantitative field Experience with real-time ML inference and streaming data pipelines
Knowledge of AutoML platforms and automated hyperparameter tuning
Familiarity with model compression, quantization, and edge deployment Experience with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud ML architectures
Contributions to open-source ML tools or platforms




Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
4 weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 days of the year




Application process:

Please submit your resume highlighting relevant experience and include a cover letter explaining your interest in the specific role
Provide links to relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or publications
Be prepared to discuss technical projects and problem-solving approaches in interviews
