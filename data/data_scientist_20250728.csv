Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra's ability to achieve its mission is determined by our ability to work together — as defined by our core values: Transparency, Collaboration, Operational Excellence, Ownership, and Empathy. We seek individuals who embody these values, as they are instrumental in ensuring our team consistently delivers excellence and fosters an engaging and supportive culture

Phaidra is based in the USA, but we are 100% remote with no physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, and India.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Annual Base Pay $176,600 - $225,900 USD

When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. and/or Canada locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.

Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday (for non-exempt employees), plus a day off for their birthday. Non-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco’s flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco’s Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.

Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows


75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;


1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;

1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.

Splunk, a Cisco company, is an Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis.

We are training foundation models from scratch, designing new reasoning architectures, and deploying them on state-of-the-art GPU clusters. This is not fine-tuning someone else’s work. This is building from first principles.

As an AI/ML Engineer, you’ll be part of the team that makes this real. You’ll work on both sides of the problem: how models are trained and how they run in the world. You’ll design and build the systems that power large-scale training runs and efficient inference. You’ll work closely with our AI Researchers to implement the latest algorithms and ideas.

This is a deep engineering role. You’ll be writing a lot of code, instrumenting systems, optimizing performance, and debugging weird, messy edge cases in distributed training and model serving. If you love figuring out how foundation models really work under the hood, this is your team.

We’re expanding our global network of Maincoders by establishing a new Seattle office. Join us in shaping this hub from day one while collaborating closely with our Melbourne headquarters to push forward the frontier of AI research and engineering.

What You’ll Do


Build and scale training pipelines for sovereign foundation models like large language models and other architectures
Design efficient inference systems that run these models in real-world environments
Optimize data pipelines, tokenization, batch prep, and distributed training at multi-node scale
Build deep observability into training and inference, improving performance, correctness, and efficiency
Debug and troubleshoot the hardest parts of model training and deployment, including distributed failures, GPU bugs, data inconsistencies, and scaling limits
Work closely with AI Researchers to translate cutting-edge algorithms into working systems
Establish strong ModelOps practices to ensure reproducibility, reliability, and continuous improvement across the full lifecycle of foundation models, from initial experiments to production deployment


Who You Are


Passionate about how models are built, trained, and run, especially large-scale foundation models
Driven by curiosity about model internals, training dynamics, and system-level performance
Excited to work across both training and inference, not just one side of the ML stack
Skilled in Python and ML frameworks like PyTorch or JAX. Familiarity with distributed compute (CUDA, Triton, NCCL, etc.) is a bonus but not required
Constantly learning, whether it’s reading open-source repos, replicating research ideas, or designing your own tools to explore a problem
Hands-on and determined. You like writing code, running experiments, and figuring things out
Motivated to help build sovereign AI capability here in Australia


Why Maincode

We are a small team building some of the most advanced AI systems in Australia. We are creating new foundation models from scratch, not just using what’s already out there.

We operate our own GPU clusters, run large-scale training, and work closely across research and engineering to push the frontier of what’s possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who:


Care about model internals, not just outputs
Build things that work, at scale
Take pride in learning, experimenting, and shipping
Want to help Australia build independent, world-class AI systems


Compensation Range: A$150K - A$180K

An analytical and data driven mindset, and know how to measure success with complicated ML/AI products.
Put machine learning models or other data-derived artifacts into production at scale.
Experience leading technical architecture discussions and helped drive technical decisions within the team.
The ability to write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
Strong communication skills and you are capable of explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other specialists.
Strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.


Nice to have:


Expertise in retrieval systems and search algorithms.
Familiarity with vector databases and embeddings.
Knowledge of using multiple data types in RAG solutions including structured, unstructured, and knowledge graphs.
Broad experience across NLP, ML, and Generative AI capabilities.

We enable careers in the Life Science industry and we support our clients to engage, retain and develop the right talent at the time needed.

As a women-owned business, we are happy to support female entrepreneurs bringing innovative diagnostics and treatments to patients.

Our Client

The startup is working on the development and validation of an in-vitro diagnostic that is intended to serve as a patient-centered companion diagnostic for chronic conditions with currently inadequate solutions. A positive test is expected to offer high accuracy. While the company is still in the seed phase, research and development (R&D) is on a clear path, IP protection is underway, and investor conversations have started.

The Role: COO or CBO (Co-Founder for a Dx Startup)

The CEO / CSO Is Looking For a Co-founder With Entrepreneurial Drive And Capital Commitment. Depending On Your Background, You’ll Focus Either On Operational Scaling (COO) Or Strategic And Commercial Development (CBO)

As COO, you bring structure, process and execution – ideally with experience in regulatory affairs (IVDR, ISO 13485), quality management, or diagnostics/MedTech manufacturing.

As CBO, you’ll lead go-to-market strategy, business development, and investor relations. Ideally, you have sales experience in the healthcare/B2B space or a strong network in diagnostics or MedTech.

The expectations


Entrepreneurial mindset, hands-on approach, 100% reliability
Experience (or strong interest) in life sciences, healthcare, or MedTech
Willingness to make a capital contribution (own investment) – real skin in the game
Desire to take responsibility, shape strategy, and build something meaningful in a fair, transparent partnership


Interested?

CTC is supporting the founder on a pro bono basis to find a co-founder and to realize this convincing opportunity. Once we receive your application, we will share the CEO / CSO contact data with you to get in touch with her directly.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

Your work will be instrumental in shaping our data strategy as we design and implement a best-in-class Go-to-Market motion.

Each day will bring new challenges and opportunities to drive meaningful change with data.

What You'll Achieve

We’re looking for a highly motivated engineer with experience deploying machine learning algorithms to physical systems in the real world.

The ideal candidate has hands-on experience in perception (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation) and/or behavior learning methods (e.g., Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, diffusion policies). More importantly, you’ve shipped ML models to robots in production environments, and you understand the complexities that come with it.

What you’ll do:


Develop and optimize real-time ML models for edge deployment on robotic systems
Work with vendors to label data and build robust data extraction and labeling pipelines
Design custom metrics to evaluate model performance in the field
Reduce model latency using tools like ONNX, TensorRT, or similar


What we’re looking for:


Practical experience applying machine learning with deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to solve real-world problems
Proficiency in Python and comfort with at least one systems language (e.g., C++, Rust)
Experience deploying ML models to robotic systems or other physical platforms
Experience incorporating raw sensor data like camera, lidar, radar, IMUs, etc into deep learning algorithms.
Bonus: Practical application of incorporating 3D geometry into deep learning models
Bonus: Published work in conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, We’re especially interested in engineers who thrive at the intersection of ML research and real-world robotics applications.


Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

At Artisan, we're creating AI Employees, called Artisans, and software which is sleek, easy to use, and replaces the endless stack of point solutions. We're starting with outbound sales and our AI BDR, Ava. Our platform contains every tool needed for outbound sales - B2B data, AI email sequences, deliverability optimization tools and so much more.

We're growing very rapidly and recently raised a $25M Series A round from top investors. We are looking for superstars to join us on our rocketship growth as we relentlessly work towards building a multi-billion dollar company.

About The Role

We're not just shipping AI products—we're building ones that learn and improve autonomously. We’re looking for a Growth ML & Experimentation Engineer to build Ava’s adaptive growth brain: systems that run millions of microtests and optimize outbound performance across companies, personas, and industries.

Think of this role as creating the “growth hacker” mind inside our AI BDR—combining A/B testing, reinforcement learning, and control systems at scale.

You’ll be building an AI that adapts itself to every persona, every market, and every trend—without needing to be told. This isn’t growth hacking for a website. It’s evolution for an AI employee.

What You'll Do


Design and implement automated experimentation systems (A/Z testing, multivariate optimization, Bayesian exploration, etc).
Build dynamic systems that continuously learn from open/response rates, meetings booked, and downstream metrics.
Create reinforcement loops and scoring models to help Ava adjust tone, targeting, and strategies in real-time.
Work closely with product to embed experimentation directly into the AI-user experience.
Develop tools to visualize and interpret campaign intelligence for internal teams and end users.


What You Bring


3–6+ years of experience in applied ML, ideally focused on growth, optimization, or adaptive systems.
Experience with online experimentation frameworks (A/B testing infra, bandits, causal inference, etc).
Strong Python and data engineering skills; comfortable working across pipelines, APIs, and backend systems.
Experience working with outbound or marketing funnel data is a major plus.
Passion for building intelligent systems that get better every day, without human micromanagement.


Why Join Us


Build the future of work by pioneering a new AI-native product category.
Collaborate with a mission-driven, ambitious, and high-caliber team.
Competitive salary, generous equity, and full benefits.
Regular company off-sites and team events.
Fast-moving culture where you'll ship meaningful work every week.

The role focuses on understanding and quantifying user behavior that violates the YouTube Premium terms-of-service (ToS). Several streaming services have been cracking down on abuse, and in some cases have seen growth in legit accounts following the crackdown. On YouTube Premium, there are several aspects to premium abuse: creator payout abuse, family plan and cross-border abuse and google account sharing. Each involves developing signals, methods and models that will be used to identify cases where there is a high probability of ToS violations. Further, this analyst will help develop processes for and support enforcement.

At YouTube, we believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share, and build community through our stories. We work together to give everyone the power to share their story, explore what they love, and connect with one another in the process. Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun — and we do it all together.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $141,000-$202,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process.

We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on behavior learning, specifically data-driven behavior policies and robust data infrastructure. In this role, you'll be responsible for developing and scaling state-of-the-art learning architectures, while also building the data systems that make these models reliable, scalable, and reproducible in production.

What you’ll do:


Design, train, validate, and launch models for behavior cloning and reinforcement learning
Build and maintain data ingestion, labeling, and management pipelines to ensure high-quality training datasets
Build metrics to evaluate model performance in open loop, simulation, and in the real world
Collaborate with simulation, systems, and infrastructure teams to integrate ML models into real-world autonomous systems
Deploy and debug these models in real-world environments, addressing practical issues such as latency, hardware constraints, and system integration


What we’re looking for:


Practical experience applying machine learning with deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to solve real-world problems
Proficiency in Python and comfort with at least one systems language (e.g., C++, Rust)
Familiarity with recent literature and methods in learned behavior policies
Practical experience in behavior cloning and/or reinforcement learning
Bonus: Experience with diffusion policies, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, or related technologies
Bonus: Published work in conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, …


Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

Develop lead and persona scoring frameworks that help Ava decide who to reach out to, when, and how
Create models that adjust Ava’s tone, strategy, and targeting based on live campaign feedback - without human input
Work closely with Product to bake experimentation directly into Ava’s UX and decision logic


What You Bring


3–6+ years of ML experience, ideally focused on growth, recommendation engines, optimization, or adaptive systems
Experience with online experimentation frameworks (A/B testing infra, bandits, causal inference, etc)
Strong Python and data engineering skills; comfortable working across pipelines, APIs, and backend systems
Experience working with marketing funnel data is a major plus
Passion for building intelligent systems that get better every day, without human micromanagement

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market. In compliance with pay transparency laws and in pursuit of pay equity and fairness, we publish salary ranges for our open roles. On top of base salary, we also offer equity, generous perks and comprehensive benefits.

We believe in providing equal employment opportunities to all individuals regardless of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

We are looking for engineers with expertise in shipping production 3D perception systems at scale. Successful candidates have architected systems, trained models from scratch, understand the full stack (clustering, detection, classification, and tracking), and have shipped at scale. We use both computer vision and LIDAR-based approaches, so knowledge of either or both is key. Models are just part of the system: you understand data and have good intuition about why models fail. You know how to eval for corner cases, manage or build data pipelines, use autolabels (or not), and have a strong understanding of statistical properties of these systems.

Our perception system is a core element in safeguarding the people, vehicles, and projects we work on. The system is central to ensuring that as we scale less traditional learning approaches, that the system is always safe. You have a passion for rigor and safety.

The role is best suited for a hands-on engineer who has shipped perception systems into the real world, and is interested in building the right system with modern approaches from scratch. You will need to articulate a clear vision of a modern perception system, and how to train and evaluate it efficiently and quickly. Join us!

Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

We offer creators a variety of ways to engage with their communities and build a lasting business including: paid memberships, free memberships, community chats, live experiences, and selling to fans directly with one-time purchases.

Ultimately our goal is simple: fund the creative class. And we're leaders in that space, with:



$8 billion+ in revenue generated since Patreon's inception
60 million+ free new memberships for fans who may not be ready to pay just yet, and
10 million+ fans paying each month for exclusive access to creators' work and community.



We're continuing to invest heavily in building the best creator platform with the best team in the creator economy and are looking for a Staff Data Scientist to support our mission.

This role is based in New York or San Francisco and open to those who are able to be in-office 2 days per week on a hybrid work model.

About The Role



You’ll work in lock step with your cross-functional team to build product features that help creators improve their membership monetization.
You’ll conduct quantitative research to inform product strategy and opportunities, design metrics to help track goals and make decisions, devise learning methods (including experiments) to test hypotheses, and work closely with our machine learning and data engineering teams on building MVP user-facing data products.
You'll translate data into actionable insights and communicate your technical work to the data team, your cross-functional partners, executive leadership, and the rest of the company.
You’ll be a cultural and technical leader on the data science team.



About You



Bachelor's degree in Statistics, Economics, Engineering, Mathematics, a related quantitative field, or equivalent practical experience.
You have a wealth of experience helping product teams make great decisions with data.
You are an experimentation expert and possess a very strong statistical inference skillset.
You have solid analytical thinking. You ask the right questions and strive to see beyond the numbers to understand what an analysis represents in terms of real-world applications.
You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
You are a SQL expert and have experience in Python or R to perform statistical analyses.
You have a track record of building strong relationships with product, engineering, research, and design teammates.
You have a growth mindset and aspire to continuously improve your soft and technical skills.
You are an expert communicator with a love for clarity and simplicity.



About Patreon

Patreon powers creators to do what they love and get paid by the people who love what they do. Our team is passionate about making this mission and our core values come to life every day in our work. Through this work, our Patronauts:



Put Creators First | They’re the reason we’re here. When creators win, we win.
Build with Craft | We sign our name to every deliverable, just like the creators we serve.
Make it Happen | We don’t quit. We learn and deliver.
Win Together | We grow as individuals. We win as a team.



We hire talented and passionate people from different backgrounds because workplace diversity and inclusion is critical to our ability to serve creators worldwide. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t match with every bullet point outlined above, we strongly encourage you to apply anyway. If you’re a creator at heart, are energized by our mission, and share our company values, we’d love to hear from you.

Patreon is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We provide employment opportunities without regard to age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, disability, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other protected class. If you need a reasonable accommodation during the interview process, please let us know via email at accomodations@patreon.

Patreon offers a competitive benefits package including and not limited to salary, equity plans, healthcare, flexible time off, company holidays and recharge days, commuter benefits, lifestyle stipends, learning and development stipends, patronage, parental leave, and 401k plan with matching.

Patreon operates under a hybrid work model, where employees based in office locations are expected to come into the office two days per week, excluding sick time and paid leave. The goal of this policy is to be intentional about the in-person time we spend together to strengthen the feeling of community at Patreon. Candidates hired into remote-eligible roles are not expected to meet the same requirements.

At Patreon, we believe in fair and transparent pay. In compliance with New York and California pay transparency laws, we are sharing the expected salary range for this role.

The posted salary range is dependent on the location and the level. This range may encompass multiple levels within the role’s job family. The final offer will be based on candidate’s experience, skills, competencies, and geographic location, aligning with the appropriate job level within Patreon’s leveling framework. For remote employees located outside CA and NY, salary may vary based on location and local market conditions.

Patreon reserves the right to modify or update compensation and benefits at any time.

Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.

To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.

Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.

While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.

Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users. With a deep expertise in experimentation, analytics and advanced modeling, we produce insights which directly move the company’s bottom line.

What you'll be doing


Perform analyses on products to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic recommendations.
Design and guide experiments/analysis to measure impact and drive product improvements.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports, enhancing data infrastructure for better analysis.


What We Look For In You


At least a BA/BS in a quantitative field (ex Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) with ≥2+ years of relevant experience.
Experience driving impact for a digital product with an iterative development cycle.
Understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (in A|B testing, causal inference, ML, etc.).
Experience in data analyses using SQL.
Experience in programming/modeling in Python.
Demonstration of our core cultural values: clear communication, positive energy, continuous learning, and efficient execution.


Disclaimer: Applying for a specific role does not guarantee consideration for that exact position. Leveling and team matching are assessed throughout the interview process.

We are an MIT-born, venture-backed Silicon Valley startup building Engineering General Intelligence (EGI)—an AI Copilot for design and manufacturing. Our mission is to fundamentally reinvent how physical products are designed and built, dramatically accelerating the pace of product development.

About The Role

You’ll play a critical role in designing EGI: AI that understands how to design, reason, and build like an experienced mechanical engineer. In this role, you’ll use your deep knowledge of mechanical design and manufacturing to create high-quality reference models, engineering workflows, and datasets that power our AI systems. You’ll embed engineering judgment into the training loop and shape how machines learn to solve real-world design and manufacturing problems.

Responsibilities


Design and build high-quality mechanical components and assemblies in CAD to serve as ground truth for training and evaluating AI systems
Define and maintain standards for model quality, metadata, and annotation to ensure consistency and reliability across datasets
Collaborate closely with ML, software, and product teams to shape dataset requirements and influence model behavior through representative engineering examples
Manage and guide a team of external contractors, including writing SOPs, reviewing output quality, and ensuring timely delivery of data assets



What We’re Looking For


Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering or related field

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

How You Will Make An Impact

Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies

Preferred Experience


Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline

Nos 4 valeurs : proximité, chaleur humaine, éthique et responsabilité.

Butagaz s'engage pour l'humain et déploie une politique handicap visant à garantir une meilleure inclusion au sein de ses équipes. Les candidatures de personnes en situation de handicap sont donc les bienvenues et seront étudiées avec attention par notre équipe recrutement.

Vous Avez Également Un Rôle Clé Pour Assurer Que Les Opérations Du Site Se Déroulent En Toute Sécurité (après Formation En Interne)


Vous prenez le rôle de responsable sécurité du site en l’absence de votre responsable et assurez les fonctions de directeur des secours en cas de déclenchement du Plan d’Opération Interne (après formations et accompagnement),
Vous supervisez les travaux d’entreprises extérieures en toute sécurité avec la gestion de la coactivité et la préparation des plans de préventions (après formation en interne),
Vous supervisez et établissez les besoins de formation du personnel (selon règles établies ou sur proposition d’une évolution de l’organisation),
Vous assurez, après formation en interne, le maintien des compétences des équipes sur le déploiement du Plan d’Opération Interne ainsi que la préparation des exercices.


En Complément


Vous proposez les modifications d’organisation interne en cas de changements temporaires des règles d’exploitation de l’installation pour le déroulement de travaux.
Vous interagissez avec les différents acteurs internes et externes à l’entreprise (internes au site ou en service support) pour mener à bien les projets qui vous sont confiés.
Vous participez aux analyses de risques, suivez les plans d’action associés, animez la démarche de remontées terrain.
Vous assistez votre responsable pour le respect de la règlementation associée à l’exploitation d’un site classé SEVESO, et vous l’accompagnez pour maintenir de bonnes relations avec les représentants de l’administration (DREAL), des industriels voisins, ou des services publics (SDIS, Police, …).


Dans un second temps, des déplacements ponctuels peuvent avoir lieu sur les 3 dépôts rattachés au site de Petit-Couronne pour mener des missions similaires.

Les Atouts Du Poste

Poste enrichissant, sans routine, avec la possibilité d’acquérir de nombreuses compétences dans de multiples domaines.

Notre collectif offre une complémentarité unique de services pour accompagner tous types de clients, du particulier à l’investisseur institutionnel, de la petite copropriété aux grands comptes français et internationaux.

Nous dédions nos marques et nos expertises autour des métiers de syndic, gérance, location transaction et property management, et de l'assurance spécialisée en immobilier :

Description du poste

L’ambition d’Evoriel grâce au soutien de son actionnaire Bridgepoint est de croître significativement dans les prochaines années. Une partie importante de la création de valeur sera générée via la croissance externe et l’amélioration continue de la qualité de service de son réseau.

Le rôle du Directeur de projet au sein de l’équipe intégration consistera à coordonner l’ensemble des étapes et des parties prenantes intervenants dans le cadre de l’acquisition d’une structure, principalement des cabinets d’Administration de Biens de la phase d’audit à l’intégration opérationnelle.

Vous pourriez également être amené à reprendre des agences/cabinets dont le dirigeant aurait quitté ses fonctions ou qui aurait besoin de soutien durant une période. Cette fonction pourrait vous conduire à reprendre durant une période les tâches opérationnelles d’un dirigeant à la fois dans le cadre d’un rachat de structure que d’une structure déjà au sein du réseau.


Conduite des audits opérationnels et métiers post-LoI
Effectuer ou superviser les due diligences opérationnelles, organisationnelles et métiers des cibles après l’émission de la LoI
Identifier les risques critiques pouvant impacter la valorisation, la faisabilité ou le succès de l’intégration
Déterminer les points à lever par les cédants avant le closing et établir les actions correctives nécessaires
Évaluer les synergies potentielles ainsi que les points de friction avec l’organisation actuelle
Formaliser un rapport d’audit structuré et en assurer la restitution aux parties prenantes internes
Définition et validation de la stratégie d’intégration
Élaborer un plan d’intégration cible aligné avec les objectifs stratégiques du groupe
Anticiper les défis opérationnels et humains liés à l’intégration et proposer des solutions adaptées
Ajuster la stratégie d’intégration en fonction des conclusions de l’audit et des recommandations des directions concernées
Assurer la cohérence entre la vision stratégique de l’acquisition et les modalités d’exécution sur le terrain
Coordination de la phase de pré-intégration
Superviser la réalisation des audits complémentaires nécessaires (RH, IT, juridique, financier, conformité).
Assurer la mise en relation et le partage d’informations entre les différentes directions impactées
S’assurer de la transmission des conclusions aux équipes en charge de l’intégration post-closing
Identifier les quick wins et prioriser les actions à mettre en place dès le closing pour maximiser la création de valeur
Gestion des synergies et alignement des processus
Analyser les synergies potentielles (opérationnelles, financières, commerciales, etc.) afin de réaliser dans un délai de 18 mois le potentiel analysé dans le cadre du dossier d’investissement [sous 18 mois, l’objectif est de passer de l’EBITDA comptable (réel) à l’EBITDA normatif (maîtrise des coûts et optimisation de fonctionnement) puis à l’EBITDA cible déployant les synergies de revenus]
Harmoniser les processus entre l’entreprise acquise et le groupe (RH, IT, finance, risques et contrôle interne, etc…)
Superviser la qualité de la migration et la bonne mise en place des processus cibles
Mettre en place des KPI pour suivre l’avancement de l’intégration et les bénéfices attendus
Gestion du changement et accompagnement des équipes
Superviser la communication interne et externe pour assurer une adoption fluide du changement
Assurer la rétention des talents clés et gérer les impacts RH (mobilité, harmonisation des contrats, etc.)
Organiser des formations et accompagner les équipes dans la maîtrise des outils et des méthodes de travail
Pilotage humain, financier et reporting
Etablir un calendrier prévisionnel pour l’intégration prenant en compte le dimensionnement humain et financier
Suivre l’impact financier de l’intégration sur les résultats du groupe
Assurer le suivi humain et budgétaire du projet d’intégration
Produire des reportings réguliers pour le CODIR sur l’avancement du projet et les résultats obtenus
Produire un retour sur expérience pour enrichir le process d’intégration et améliorer la phase de ciblage et d’audit des futures acquisitions


En résumé, le Directeur de Projet au sein de l’équipe Intégration est le chef d’orchestre du rapprochement des entreprises, garantissant la création de valeur et la fluidité de l’intégration à tous les niveaux depuis la phase d’audit jusqu’à la phase d’intégration complète.

La liste des missions ci-dessus est non exhaustive, et le périmètre ainsi défini pourra être modifié en fonction de l’évolution de l’organisation de la Société.

Qualifications

Vous êtes issu d’un parcours académique en finance/assurance/immobilier, idéalement obtenu dans une école de commerce ou en université, avec une solide expérience (minimum 10 ans) si possible avec une connaissance des spécificités de l’immobilier.
