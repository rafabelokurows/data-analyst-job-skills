In this role, you’ll tackle a wide range of pricing-related challenges—from developing intelligent pricing algorithms to advancing our experimentation techniques. You will support other Data Scientists in delivering high-quality solutions, challenge assumptions, and help raise the bar for data science practices across our teams.

Contribute to long-term strategic planning and defining a short-term roadmap to tackle complex and meaningful data problems.

Qualifications


Solid statistical skills—you’re confident with fundamentals and first-principles thinking in statistics and machine learning theory.
Strong engineering background—you write clean, maintainable Python code and SQL queries, following best practices for production systems.
Deep expertise in at least one relevant domain (e.g., causal inference, time series, Bayesian methods, neural networks, NLP/LLM, ranking/matching, advanced experimentation).
Thoughtful approach—you challenge assumptions and care deeply about working with clean, trustworthy data.
Substantial experience in a business environment where you developed a strong business understanding.
Clear communicator—you can distill complex requirements from many stakeholders into a clear, MVP-ready direction.
You value agile processes, data-driven development, reliability, and rigorous experimentation.


Nice to have:


Experience in pricing or food delivery business.

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

poorly suited for women’s health applications. Doctors need fast, reliable tools to

help with complicated diagnoses. Women deserve clarity, not guesswork when

managing their vaginal health from home. A high-resolution pH test can catch

imbalances early, making it easier to monitor issues like bacterial vaginosis,

recurring vaginal infections, sexually transmitted infections, ovulation, PCOS, and

menopause. By building pHera, you would be building a tool that would advance women's health.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

You’ll work on AI agents, retrieval pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and custom tooling to ensure reliability, auditability, and performance of our AI systems in production.




This is not just another ML role—you’ll be working at the intersection of research and real-world impact, shipping systems that solve messy, high-stakes tasks in production, inside a highly regulated domain.




If you love building agentic AI systems, hacking on retrieval pipelines, running evals at scale, and making AI safe and usable in the wild—this role is for you.




Who We Are




We are Inca – a venture-backed startup on a mission to automate insurance claims through Agentic AI.





💥 We’ve just closed one of the largest and most competitive InsurTech Pre-Seed rounds in Europe – backed by top-tier VCs.


🚀 We bring Agentic AI to insurance industry with a no-bullshit approach — delivering cutting-edge results, where others overpromise.


🔥 The market is on fire: we’re flooded with inbound interest from insurers eager to transform their claims processes.


🧠 Our team combines former BCG Project Leaders, industry- and AI-experts. Together, we’re redefining how insurances are operating in Europe.





What we are Building




At INCA, we’re building the engine behind the future of insurance. Our hyper-modular Agentic AI platform is redefining how automation scales in heavily regulated enterprise environments. Powered by the latest frameworks in agentic computing, our system isn’t just smart — it’s redefining the speed, service quality, and fairness of insurance.





🧠 At the core: a modular Agentic Engine that commands specialized agent teams, each built for mission-critical tasks across the insurance claims lifecycle.


🛠️ Each agent is equipped with best-in-class tools, integrated seamlessly — from data retrieval to decision support to payout optimization.


🎯 The result? A powerful, compliant, and highly adaptive AI system that sets a new bar for enterprise-ready Agentic AI.



Tasks


You’ll work side-by-side with our CPO — but that’s not all. You’ll also have direct mentorship from our Head of Engineering. With 15+ years of startup experience — including at BCG Digital Ventures, SoundCloud, and Issuu — he’s scaled products from early MVP to millions of users, built world-class teams, and seen what it takes to win. You’ll learn how to build right — and build fast.





Build Agentic Systems: Use frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, or AutoGen to build robust AI agents that perform structured tasks with autonomy and reasoning


RAG Pipelines: Design and deploy retrieval-augmented generation systems to ensure accurate, grounded outputs from LLMs


Evaluate & Iterate Agents in Practice: Build evaluation loops using automatic metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), self-consistency, chain of doubt, LLM-as-judge, or custom classifiers


Production Integration: Work closely with backend and infra teams to integrate AI models into real products


Own AI Quality: Create tools and dashboards, CI hooks, or human-in-the-loop flows that ensure reliable auditable & explainable AI behavior at scale



Requirements



2–5 years' experience in AI/ML engineering**,** with a focus on LLMs, RAG, or NLP systems in a high-paced environment (e.g., start-up, scale-up)


Solid Python skills and hands-on with modern AI tooling (e.g., RAG-optimization, vector data bases, evaluation tools etc.)


Familiarity with prompt engineering, embeddings, and evaluating LLM outputs in production


Proven track record shipping in fast iteration loops with unsolved challenges in highly dynamic environment


Proactive, curious, and user-oriented—you want to build highly autonomous, scalable and auditable agentic systems with the best tools and frameworks in the market





Bonus Points For





Experience with AWS, GCP, or Azure for model deployment or vector storage - we will set-up AI agents in a multi-cloud environment


Familiarity with LLM finetuning or low-rank adaptation (LoRA)


Experience with insurance, regtech, or other high-compliance domains





Your First 30 Days





🤖 Ship an Agent: Build or refine an internal AI agent for a specific task (e.g. claim triage, document QA)


🔍 RAG Evaluation: Benchmark and compare two RAG pipelines using automatic and LLM-based evals


📈 Build Eval Dashboard: Make model quality and failure cases transparent across the team


🛠 Optimize Retrieval: Improve embedding relevance or chunking strategies for better grounding



Benefits


Why Join Us?





🤖 AI That Ships: Build real-world LLM systems—not just research prototypes


🔍 Agentic Infrastructure: Own the logic, structure, and behavior of AI agents in production


🛠 Cutting Edge Stack: Use the best tools in Agentic AI and help us push them further


🧠 High Autonomy: Drive both research and implementation decisions alongside experienced teammates


🪙 Equity + Competitive Salary: Strong base + ESOPs


🧳 Location: Offices in Berlin or Munich (3+days per week), frequent team events


🧳 Holiday: 30 days of vacation & up to two weeks “work-from-everywhere”


📈 Culture: We are builders and are dedicated to building an open, inclusive and driven culture where engineers thrive - professionally and personally.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation, and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone.

Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions.

Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Backed by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, the IPA, and Sky, Barb has been the source of official TV viewing figures for decades. 




Barb is uniquely placed to empower transformation of the UK TV and advertising ecosystem through reliable and accurate data.  




These data fulfil three purposes:  




To support decisions that are made in the making and distribution of great programmes.  
To support the planning and buying of ad campaigns and informing on brand and sales outcomes.  
To inform how broadcasters and other media services operate in the public interest. 




As the media industry evolves, so does Barb. We've expanded our measurement beyond traditional panels to incorporate large-scale online data and streaming services. Through our campaign reporting tools, Barb also provides the full picture of cross-platform pre and post campaign reporting. 




Our hybrid approach combines people-based panel data with census-level device data to deliver inclusive measurement of total identified viewing across all platforms, services, and devices. This empowers broadcasters, advertisers, and regulators to make more better, fairer, more informed decisions. 




Overview 

We’re seeking a Junior Data Scientist to help build the future of UK audience measurement. This is a unique opportunity to join a small, expert team of 13, reporting directly to the Head of Data Science and working on foundational systems used by major media organisations across the UK. 




You can expect to work on high-impact projects including: 




The Barb Data Hub, a centralised Snowflake data warehouse serving as the single source of truth for Barb data. You’ll help develop a library of reusable analysis tools. 
Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Sharing – ensuring users can apply Barb’s complex methodologies efficiently and accurately. 
Barb Panel Plus, a new system integrating “return path data” from TV sets and set-top boxes with existing panel data. 




These projects pose exciting challenges from the point of view of data engineering, statistical modelling, and software development. This role will be of interest to someone starting their career as a data scientist and excited by the prospect of finding brilliant solutions to these problems. The role would be well-suited to someone who is a talented coder, logical thinker, enjoys working with data, has an interest in the TV industry, and is looking to grow into their career as a data scientist. 




Key responsibilities 




Work closely with the Barb executive team and partners to understand and implement the Barb Calculation Methodology, which is a complex set of conventions and algorithms that describe how to use Barb panel data to calculate standard audience metrics. 
Build and maintain a shared library of reusable data analysis tools for Barb’s users and suppliers. 
Support users of Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Share, ensuring they produce correct and industry-standard outputs. 
Translate parts of the methodology into reliable, production-ready Python code for use across Barb’s systems. 
Contribute to the evaluation and development of statistical and machine learning models for return path data integration. 
Develop ELT pipelines and modelling solutions for data integration projects. 

 




Qualifications 




A degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., STEM, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics). 
Good working knowledge of Python and SQL. 
Experience with Python data packages (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) preferred. 
Strong mathematical and statistical foundation. 
Ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with others. 

 

Experience 




The ideal candidate will have some experience with: 

Data engineering; working with databases, building infrastructure for moving, storing, and processing data.  
Modelling; analysing data using statistical or machine-learning techniques 




Preferred: 

Experience with Snowflake, or other cloud data platforms such as Databricks or BigQuery. 
Familiarity with Snowpark or similar distributed computing frameworks such as Spark. 

For graduates, the above could include projects done at university or during an internship. 




 




Benefits 




Base salary will reflect the responsibilities of the role and be commensurate with experience. Barb offers a discretionary bonus scheme alongside the following benefits. 




Office in central London – with hybrid working options 
Pension contributions up to a maximum of 9% of salary — employees’ contribution matched +3% 
Five weeks paid holiday — rising to six weeks after 10 years’ service 
Holiday purchase scheme — purchase up to five additional days in any calendar year 
Group Life Assurance — four times annual salary 
Group Income Protection — 75% of salary after 26 weeks absence 
Enhanced pay for parental/adoption leave after 18 months of service — 13 weeks at 100% of basic salary followed by 26 weeks at the statutory rate

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Role Overview:

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalization.

What you will be doing:

You’ll join a London-based agile team building and supporting data science products that drive business impact across PlayStation. You’ll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to serve teams such as marketing, operations, engineering, product planning, R&D, and finance.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Help drive data literacy across the business
Collaborate with a high-performing team of data scientists to apply insights and drive innovation throughout the company.


Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

What you'll be doing:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience
Experience applying data science techniques such as supervised/unsupervised learning, segmentation, forecasting, causal inference, and uplift modelling
Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:


Experience with data science tooling (e.g., workflow orchestrators like Airflow, feature stores)
Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)
Private Medical Insurance
Dental Scheme
25 days holiday per year
On Site Gym
Subsidised Café
Free soft drinks
On site bar
Access to cycle garage and showers

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a Data Scientist At Deliveroo, Your Main Goal Is To Maximise Business Impact Within One Of Many Business Areas. You Will Help Answer Questions Like


Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?


The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements


A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

Diversity

Proficient in SQL, Python/R; experience with event instrumentation and analytics tools
Experience building dashboards and tracking metric health
Excellent communicator—can explain insights clearly to engineers, designers, marketers, and leaders
Entrepreneurial mindset—comfortable in ambiguity and fast iteration
Based in London, able to be in Canary Wharf 3 days/week

We've seen extremely rapid growth over the last month, and are looking for someone who can help us improve the quality of our agent experience and scale to the next level.




What you'll do:

You'll work on building and improving the best LLM group chat experience there is. This includes:

Identifying novel ways to build a ""memory"" that leads to a personalized and unique experience for our users.
Leading technical decision-making to find solutions that are both innovative and practical.




Who you are:

You're an experienced machine learning engineer with broad knowledge and skills in natural language processing (NLP) and LLMs. You're detail-oriented when it matters to make sure things get done right, but also know how to strike the balance between speed and perfection in a fast-moving startup environment. You:




Know the pitfalls and tricks for building with LLMs, especially RAG systems
Have experience with the level of obsession over detail needed to produce high-quality ML systems.
Are experienced and comfortable building backend systems and working across a code base, not just in Jupyter notebooks.
Are experienced writing Python (knowing Go is a plus)
You know how to work independently to handle ambiguity




We're willing to compromise on years of experience for the right candidate who brings energy, intelligence, and a passion for our mission.




This is a hybrid position (3 days per week in office) that can be based in Seattle or New York City. Remote candidates will not be considered at this time.




A little about us:

Our team is a fantastic bunch of accomplished engineers and researchers from Google, Slack, Disney, and AI startups. We're pretty clued in on the technology side and have a strong vision of how the transformative technology of the last few years along with our own secret sauce (not just a ChatGPT wrapper) can help a huge number of people.




Compensation & Benefits:

We compensate with a competitive salary and equity, health benefits, 401k, and the opportunity to help shape the future of AI agents during this transformative moment in computing history!

At illumin, we are transforming the advertising landscape. Our platform offers an integrated space for journey planning, execution, and reporting. It empowers marketers to connect with their audiences in powerful ways through real-time data and easy-to-use visual tools. By seamlessly combining media planning and buying in an intuitive interface, marketers can take complete control of their campaigns, meeting customers wherever they are in the buying journey and maximizing the impact of their ad spend through personalized insights for smarter decision-making.




We are at a pivotal moment, evolving into a product-led company with a team of over 100 skilled professionals and new leadership guiding our path forward. By harnessing the power of data, advancing our AI capabilities, and deeply investing in our people, we are preparing for a future that will redefine what’s possible in journey advertising.




Our work is guided by two beliefs: that the ability to execute is paramount to success and that we are only as good as our people. As we grow and transform, we are looking for team members (illumineers) who share our bias for speed, delivery over perfection, and an entrepreneurial mindset. Joining us now is a chance to be part of our transformation.




Who we need




Reporting to the Director, AI, we are looking for a Data Scientist to play a pivotal role in transforming complex data into impactful solutions that drive the success of our AdTech platform. In this role, you will craft and optimize algorithms to improve ad targeting, delivery, and bidding strategies. Utilizing big data technologies, you will build scalable systems, enhance recommendation models, and ensure the efficiency and flexibility of data science processes.




This is a full-time, on-site opportunity working Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays in our downtown Toronto office. Our headquarters are located within minutes of St. Andrew and Union subway stations.




What's in it for you




Impact. You are driven to change an industry by delivering a platform that clients actively seek out and value. Our customers recognize and value our relentless focus on driving their success. As part of a small Data Science team within a publicly traded, product-led company, you will play a pivotal role in shaping the revolutionary impact of our product on ad campaigns. This is an opportunity to influence feature development and optimization, drawing on data analytics to provide actionable recommendations that will be instrumental in driving innovation and maintaining the efficiency of our tools and systems.




Technical exposure. Our platform processes nearly 150 billion requests daily, driving programmatic traffic globally across all devices, streaming services, and out-of-home targeted advertising. Working with data at this scale is a rare opportunity. This is a chance to apply your skills and grow your expertise in analyzing vast datasets and extracting actionable insights to optimize live campaigns and platform features, ensuring measurable improvements for advertisers.




Professional development. You want to grow - your skills, your influence, your career. We push the limits to improve and to reach our full potential, individually and as a company. We are committed to building the strengths of our team. You will be supported by your manager and have access to one-on-one coaching with our Chief Empowerment Officer's team. Your accountabilities, learning opportunities, and scope for ownership and career growth will rapidly expand as we continue to step up to meet the increased value and shifting needs for AdTech.




How you will make an impact:




Develop innovative solutions. You will design, develop, and refine algorithms to enhance ad targeting, delivery, and bidding strategies. You will build predictive models to segment audiences, predict conversion likelihood, and forecast engagement.
Analyze and extract insights. You will analyze large datasets from advertising campaigns, user interactions, and platform performance to draw actionable insights. You will develop reports and dashboards to visualize key metrics such as click-through rates (CTR), return on ad spend (ROAS), and audience behaviour.
Build scalable data solutions. You will leverage big data technologies to process and analyze massive datasets efficiently. Using data insights, you will develop and refine recommendation systems to suggest ideal audiences, ad formats, and bidding strategies. You will ensure the scalability of data science models and workflows to accommodate growing data volumes and user demands.
Optimize campaigns. You will apply advanced statistical techniques to optimize live campaigns, including bid adjustments, creative improvements, and audience targeting refinements. You will conduct A/B or multivariate testing to identify the most effective strategies for different audience segments.
Optimize platform performance. You will monitor platform features to ensure they deliver optimal results for advertisers, identifying and troubleshooting anomalies or inefficiencies in data pipelines and algorithms. You will help maintain our data mining tools and platforms while staying up-to-date with new approaches and trends in the field, incorporating them into your own solutions.
Collaborate. You will work with product managers, engineers, and designers to integrate data science solutions into the platform. You will provide data-driven recommendations to enhance features such as dynamic ad creatives, real-time analytics, and programmatic ad placements. You will communicate the performance and results of the models to management, providing clear and actionable recommendations based on the findings.




What you bring:




The experience. You bring the combined academic and professional expertise in addressing data science challenges in the advertising, financial, or insurance industries; you have a solid understanding of economic principles. You have experience developing and refining data-driven solutions to enhance product performance and user experience. A Masters in Data Science, Statistics, Applied Mathematics, or Actuarial Science is preferred.
The drive. You are highly analytical, innovative, and solution-oriented and you excel at turning complex data problems into actionable insights. You thrive in a fast-paced environment, adapt to shifting priorities, and can make informed decisions quickly.
The technical expertise. You have a proven track record of analyzing, benchmarking, and optimizing the performance of data pipelines and machine learning models. You are proficient in Python, SQL, and working with large datasets using current data science tools and methodologies.
The interpersonal skills. You have excellent written and verbal communication skills and can relay complex data concepts effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders. You can build trust and collaborate seamlessly with cross-functional teams, sharing knowledge and adopting constructive feedback. You value diverse perspectives and understand how they contribute to better decision-making and innovation.
The growth mindset. You are naturally curious and eager to learn. You view setbacks as opportunities for growth, using them to refine your approach. Resourceful and self-motivated, you stay current with the latest trends, tools, and techniques in data science, machine learning, and AI to stay ahead in the field.

As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

What You’ll Do


Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more.

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.




About the Role:




We're seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to bridge the gap between our data products, data science insights and production systems. You'll be responsible for taking ML models from concept to production, building robust MLOps infrastructure, and ensuring our machine learning systems operate reliably at scale.

Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
