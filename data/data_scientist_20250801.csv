Jouw nieuwe functie als AI Engineer

Dagelijks werken onze experts aan innovatieve oplossingen voor onze klanten en vertalen complexe vraagstukken naar concrete resultaten. Wij onderscheiden ons door niet alleen bestaande modellen toe te passen, maar ook door het ontwikkelen, trainen en implementeren van eigen machine learning modellen. Dit doen we voor uiteenlopende sectoren, zoals de zorg, transport en overheid, waar onze modellen bijdragen aan efficiëntere processen, slimmere besluitvorming en betere dienstverlening.




Vanuit regio Noord-Nederland maak je als AI Engineer AI praktisch én schaalbaar. Je werkt aan innovatieve oplossingen met een bewezen waarde voor onze klanten. Denk aan slimme zorg met machine learning, het ontwikkelen van generatieve AI-oplossingen met LLM's of het integreren van beeld- en taalmodellen in bedrijfsprocessen. Ook werk je aan slimme chatbots en co-pilots die bedrijfsprocessen versnellen of gebruikers intuïtief ondersteunen. Je snapt hoe je met prompt engineering het maximale uit een LLM haalt, en hoe je generatieve AI koppelt aan interne kennisbronnen via technieken als RAG en vector search.




Je schakelt moeiteloos tussen techniek en toepassing. Samen met data engineers, data scientists en cloudspecialisten bouw je aan oplossingen die niet in de la belanden, maar daadwerkelijk draaien in productieomgevingen. Je werkt met Azure AI, OpenAI, Azure Machine Learning, en je weet hoe je AI inricht als onderdeel van een schaalbare data-architectuur.




Wat bieden wij jou:

Salaris tussen de €4.500,- en €6.500,- o.b.v. 40 uur, plus bonussysteem
Volledig hybride werken: bij de klant, op kantoor of vanuit huis
Omgeving waarin jouw ideeën en initiatieven actief worden gestimuleerd
Persoonlijk loopbaantraject waarin jij zelf bepaalt welke kant je op wilt groeien
Samenwerking met gedreven collega’s uit al onze specifieke vakgebieden




Wat vragen wij van jou:

Je hebt ervaring met het ontwikkelen en implementeren van AI-modellen
Je bent bekend met prompt engineering en het toepassen van LLM’s
Je hebt ervaring met Azure AI, AzureML, en werken met LLM’s
Je weet hoe je AI integreert via API’s of SDK’s (beeld, video, taal)




Verder heb je:

Een hbo- of wo-diploma, bij voorkeur in de richting van IT of specifiek AI
Minimaal 5 jaar ervaring als developer met een focus op Data & AI
Goede kennis van en ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python
De drive om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen binnen een groeiend vakgebied
Je beheerst vloeiend de Nederlandse taal in woord en geschrift




Bovenstaande criteria zijn een indicatie van het profiel dat we zoeken. We beseffen dat elk individu een unieke set aan vaardigheden, expertise, skills en denkwijzen met zich meebrengt. Tegelijkertijd blijkt uit onderzoek dat sommigen pas solliciteren als er een 100% match is. Hierbij nodigen we je uit om te solliciteren als je je herkent in het profiel, óók als je niet aan alle eisen voldoet!




Het team

De regionale teams bestaan uit experts die jouw groei en kennisontwikkeling ondersteunen. Onze collega’s zijn niet alleen (cloud) back-end data specialisten, maar ook experts in rapportages, dashboards, voorspellende analyses, data-gedreven werken, machine learning en data science. Leuk weetje: in totaal werken er zo’n 350 data specialisten binnen ilionx!

Bij ilionx draait het niet alleen om technische expertise, maar ook om de mensen achter de technologie! We hechten waarde aan een cultuur van samenwerking, kennisdeling en inspiratie. Als onderdeel van ons team maak je deel uit van een gemeenschap die gedreven wordt door nieuwsgierigheid, innovatie en een passie voor het creëren van waarde uit data. Of je nu op een van onze kantoren, bij de klant of thuis werkt, bij ilionx krijg je de perfecte omgeving om je passie voor data tot leven te brengen.

A salary between €4.521,00 and €6.402,00 gross per month (scale 11) based on a 37-hour workweek
The possibility to work hybrid with flexible working hours. Do you work two or more days a week from home? Then you will receive a €45 net compensation per month
8% holiday allowance and 25 vacation days based on a full-time employment
Travel allowance for commuting
A good pension plan through the PostNL Pension Fund
Training and development opportunities through the PostNL Academy
Discounts on holidays, events, and products

Strong Python programming skills and experience with modular code design
Experience with containerizing and deploying ML workloads (e.g., Docker, SageMaker, Airflow, Metaflow, Kedro)
Experience building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines for ML
Experience with cloud platforms such as AWS and Databricks

Due to holidays the first interviews will be from August 6th onwards
Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies show that people often hesitate to apply unless they meet all the criteria. At PostNL, we value potential and enthusiasm just as much. If this role excites you we want to hear from you!
Because PostNL believes in equal opportunity, candidates take an assessment designed to evaluate their competencies and skills relevant to the position prior to the first interview.
During the application process, we will conduct a background check. This includes requesting a Certificate of Good Conduct (VOG). We will also check your references and may conduct a custom investigation.
We're personally searching for new colleagues who want to help us build the future of PostNL. Therefore, we return any mail from recruitment agencies.

Onze expertise maakt ons uniek!

Wij zorgen ervoor dat GenAI en Advanced Analytics modellen in productie kunnen draaien, beheerd en geïnnoveerd worden. Dit is noodzakelijk om de potentie van deze modellen om te zetten in daadwerkelijke waarde.

In een team van (4) machine learning engineers werk je nauw samen met onze data scientists om de modellen die zij ontwikkelen in productie te zetten. Binnen hypotheken zijn jullie de enige die dat betrouwbaar en compliant kunnen doen. Het team werkt DevOps en is dus ook verantwoordelijk voor het beheer van de modellen en innovatie van de technologie. Zo zijn we momenteel bezig om een nieuw GenAI platform, specifiek voor ABN AMRO Hypotheken, op te zetten.

Je werk

ABN AMRO zet stevig in op GenAI en andere machine learning modellen. Om deze verantwoord en gecontroleerd in productie te zetten hebben we jou nodig. Deze modellen draaien in een databricks omgeving. Daarnaast breiden we uit met een AzureML omgeving voor onze genAI usecases. (Ruime) ervaring met Azure, databricks en Python / PySpark kennis is dan ook noodzakelijk. Werkervaring met Agile / Scrum is een pre.

Naast technische vaardigheden is de juiste mindset belangrijk. Je voelt eigenaarschap over de modellen die het team onder zijn hoede heeft. Je zoekt de samenwerking op met onze data scientists om hun behoefte te begrijpen en ze te kunnen helpen. Daarbij raak je niet je eigen vakmanschap uit het oog en geef je tegengas als de oplossing niet aan onze interne (en mogelijk externe) richtlijnen voldoet. Je hebt kwaliteit hoog in het vaandel staan.

Werkomgeving

Ons kantoor is gevestigd in Amersfoort en de sfeer op onze afdeling is gezellig en ontspannen. Passie voor je vak, ondernemerschap en vakmanschap vinden wij belangrijk op de afdeling. De cultuur is informeel, wij zijn open naar elkaar en vieren successen. We hechten veel waarde aan goede communicatie en afstemming binnen de teams en afdeling. Experimenteren wordt aangemoedigd en fouten maken mag, zolang je ervan leert en ze kunt verantwoorden. Op maandag zitten we met heel ICT op kantoor voor teammeetings en andere samenwerkingsvormen. Daarnaast hebben veel teams nog een extra dag waarin zij samenkomen.

Je profiel


Je hebt minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring als technische data specialist (ML engineer, data engineer, data scientist)
Je hebt een academisch of HBO opleidings- en werkniveau
Je bent een teamplayer, je durft de status quo te challengen
Je bent een ondernemend, analytisch en pragmatisch ingesteld
Je bent gedreven, accuraat, oplossend, analytisch en communicatief sterk
Je hebt oog voor de life-cycle ontwikkeling en je zorgt voor duurzame oplossingen
Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk
Je kunt je goed redden in het Engels (schriftelijk en mondeling) voor de samenwerking met onze collega's in Amsterdam
Technische vaardigheden:
Ervaring met Git en het bouwen van CI/CD-pipelines, bij voorkeur in Azure DevOps/Azure Pipelines
Ervaring in Python (o.a. scikit-learn, scipy, xgboost, pandas, numpy, mlflow)
Ervaring met SQL of PySpark, bij voorkeur in Databricks
Ervaring met Azure Machine Learning is wenselijk
Ervaring met het bouwen van data pipelines m.b.v. Airflow of Databricks Pipelines
Je hebt ervaring met het werken in Azure


Wij bieden


De kans om het beste uit jezelf te halen met flexibele werktijden en volop ruimte voor persoonlijke en professionele groei
Veel verantwoordelijkheid en een grote mate van autonomie in je werk, zodat je echt een verschil kunt maken
Een gezellige, informele werksfeer waarin ambitie en plezier hand in hand gaan, met veel ruimte voor eigen initiatief
Een aantrekkelijk salaris dat aansluit bij jouw kennis en ervaring
Een OV-jaarabonnement zodat je zorgeloos kunt reizen. Ook privé
Een uitstekende pensioenregeling voor een zorgeloze toekomst

Echt verrassende inzichten en innovatieve oplossingen voor onze klanten ontstaan door een samenspel van culturen, kennis en ervaring.

Do you want to use your AI and data skills to optimize Employee Experience while helping well-known companies with their business performance? We are looking for people who enjoy turning complex data into understandable insights, are passionate about AI & data science and want to contribute to the development of HR technology.

Your work as an AI & Data Science intern at #Highberg

As an intern, you will work on exploring and prototyping an innovative AI solution that helps non-technical HR users work with complex HR data in a simple and intuitive way.

The core of the assignment: you will research and build a chat interface that allows users to query structured HR data from a data warehouse, without having to write SQL or needing technical prior knowledge.

In your research, you will explore questions such as:


How can we enable natural language queries on HR datasets using generative AI?
Which tools and technologies (e.g. Copilot, Azure OpenAI, LangChain, FastAPI) are best suited for this use case?
What are the options for integrating this solution into Power BI, including security aspects such as row-level security?
What does a reliable, explainable, and user-friendly solution look like in practice?


Although we already have ideas about possible tools and architectures, we deliberately keep the technology choice open. Together with colleagues, you will research and document various design options. The ultimate goal is integration of the assistant into Power BI, but your MVP may start as a stand-alone prototype.

With your work, you will contribute directly to our mission to make data-driven HR smarter, more accessible and future-proof.

What are we asking?


You are in the final year of a study at university level;
You have experience with Python and SQL, and preferably a visualisation tool such as Power BI;
Excellent communication skills in English, both written and oral;
You are available for ≥4 days a week for at least 6 months and within 1 hour travel from our office in Amsterdam RAI.


Who are you?


You have a passion for data, AI, programming, statistics/machine learning and research;
You are enterprising, creative, flexible, results-oriented, accurate and socially adept;
You get the best out of yourself in an environment where you are challenged to go outside your comfort zone and learn new things.


What are we offering?


A good internship allowance (EUR 550 per month) and training courses worth several thousand euros;
12.5 days' holiday (for a six-month full-time employment);
Starting from September or by mutual agreement;
Supervision by an experienced data scientist;
A pleasant working environment, short communication lines, focus on performance as a team and plenty of social activities such as get-togethers, sports activities and team meetings;
Our office is located at the Zuidas in Amsterdam and is easily accessible by public transport. We ask you to work at the office a minimum of two days a week, but you are always welcome, whether it is for the good coffee, a game of table tennis or just for your colleagues.


About The Team

You will join the People, Analytics & Research team, which is part of the Organisational & Sustainability Transformation Hub. The team consists of around 25 colleagues: consultants, researchers, data scientists and data engineers. A great team of smart and driven professionals, who are always there for you with a helping hand! We not only work hard together, but also have a lot of fun together - we organise social events and we do lots of fun activities, such as outings, Friday afternoon drinks and sports events.

We are happy to help

Key Responsibilities:

Design and deliver AI-ready cloud/on-prem environments tailored to language model experimentation
Set up and manage a secure and scalable HPC infrastructure in the client's datacenter
Build automated pipelines and tooling to enable fast, repeatable LLM testing
Research and evaluate techniques and tools (LLM frameworks, GPU utilization, etc.)
Integrate platforms like Jupyter for experimentation and visualization
Work closely with ICT stakeholders to ensure infrastructure meets their model and hardware needs
Define future architecture for on-prem AI capabilities with long-term scalability in mind




Key Skills and Experience:

Proven experience in cloud or on-prem infrastructure engineering for AI/ML applications
Experience with LLMs, AI tooling, and language model deployment workflows
Strong skills in Python, Shell scripting, and environmental automation
Familiarity with AutoShell AI, Jupyter, or similar AI toolchains (or willingness to ramp up quickly)
Background in high-performance computing (HPC) or GPU-intensive workloads
Understanding of hybrid environments, custom hardware integration, and data center operations
Ability to work independently and explore emerging AI infrastructure techniques




We aim to respond promptly to all applications. However, due to high volumes, there may be times when we cannot reply to every applicant. Thank you for your understanding.

Hier combineer je technische skills met persoonlijk contact, in een hecht team met korte lijnen. Ga jij deze uitdaging aan als leerling vaatlaborant?

De functie

Als leerling vaatlaborant:


Werk je onder supervisie binnen het team Vaatdiagnostiek.
Krijg je een brede opleiding in non-invasieve vaatdiagnostiek.
Voer je zelfstandig onderzoeken uit en leer je deze te interpreteren en rapporteren bij zowel poliklinische als klinische patiënten.
Voer je arteriële en veneuze duplexen uit, waaronder (pre-)shuntonderzoeken, aneurysmacontroles, spataderonderzoeken en TIA-analyses.
Werk je met een dopplerapparaat voor het meten van enkel-armindexen en teendrukmetingen.
Vind je het leuk om met verschillende patiënten te werken en technisch met apparatuur bezig te zijn.
Draag je bij aan het samen blijven leren en verbeteren van de zorg.


Jouw afdeling

Je komt te werken in een leuk en betrokken team binnen de polikliniek Vaatdiagnostiek. Hier werk je nauw samen met drie ervaren vaatlaboranten en twee vaatchirurgen. Daarnaast is er een goede samenwerking met het Wond Expertise Centrum en de bredere polikliniek Chirurgie.

Een medewerker zegt hierover:

“Je komt te werken in een leuk team. Met sommige patiënten bouw je echt een band op, omdat ze vaker over een langere periode langs moeten komen. Het is mooi om te zien hoe een behandeling gewerkt heeft, omdat je mensen ziet voor en na een ingreep. Met sommige patiënten ben je intensief bezig door lange onderzoeken.”

De polikliniek Chirurgie bestaat uit een team van tien chirurgen, twee physician assistants, managementassistentes en secretaresses, evenals twaalf doktersassistentes. Verder werken er vaatlaboranten en mammaconsulenten binnen deze polikliniek. Het Wond Expertise Centrum bestaat uit onder andere een wond- en stomaconsulente, wondverpleegkundigen, een stomaverpleegkundige in opleiding, verpleegkundig specialisten en een physician assistant gespecialiseerd in vaatzorg.

De polikliniek Chirurgie heeft spreekuren op twee locaties: in Ziekenhuis Amstelland en op onze buitenpoli in Uithoorn. Tevredenheid van onze patiënten staat voorop en we zijn continu bezig met het verbeteren van de geleverde zorg.

Wie ben jij?


Je hebt een hbo-opleiding met natuurkunde in je vakkenpakket, zoals Fysiotherapie, MBRT, KNF, Verpleegkunde of Radiodiagnostisch Laborant
Je hebt affiniteit met vaatchirurgie
Je bent goed in de omgang met mensen en stelt patiënten op hun gemak
Je werkt zelfstandig, accuraat en bent empathisch
Je kunt goed overweg met digitale systemen
Je hebt er geen bezwaar tegen als je werkdag soms iets uitloopt


Wat wij bieden


Een leerwerkplek via Hogeschool Inholland Haarlem
Een contract van 1,5 jaar met uitzicht op een vast dienstverband
Een 24 uur contract (inclusief 1 lesdag per week)
Salaris volgens de cao Ziekenhuizen, afhankelijk van ervaring
Een enthousiast en betrokken team dat je graag begeleidt
Een eindejaarsuitkering (8,33%) en vakantiegeld (8,33%)
Aantrekkelijke secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden zoals een meerkeuzesysteem (o.a. fietsregeling en reiskostenvergoeding)
Gratis parkeergelegenheid bij het ziekenhuis

Jouw baan als Junior Grondwerker bij RECO!

Als Junior Grondwerker werk je veel samen met je collega Grondwerker.

Jullie vormen écht een vast koppel en hij leert jou (nog beter) alle kneepjes van het vak. Samen zorgen jullie voor het aanleggen van infrastructuur voor beveiligingscamera’s en bouwplaatsinrichtingen. Jouw werkzaamheden zijn:


Het creëren van sleuven om vervolgens kabels en leidingen door te trekken;
Voorsteek werkzaamheden voor de kraan;
Je assisteert de Grondwerker bij de graafwerkzaamheden;
Je doet de bestrating om het project netjes af te maken.



Bij RECO willen we jou graag blij maken met:

✅ Veel vrijheid! Je gaat namelijk elke dag naar een ander project;

✅ Maak jij extra uren? Deze betalen we maandelijks uit, met een toeslag. Daarnaast krijg je nog een extra netto vergoeding van €4,- voor de buitendagen;

✅ Een afwisselende baan in een dynamisch, informeel en groeiend familiebedrijf met een vaste collega waarmee jij een team vormt;

✅ De mogelijkheid om je te ontwikkelen middels cursussen en opleidingen;

✅ 28 – 31 vakantiedagen per jaar, zodat je ook kunt genieten van je vrije tijd;

✅ Goede pensioenregeling;

✅ Leuke activiteiten met collega’s, zoals een BBQ, borrel en teamuitje.

Het is mooi meegenomen als je:


Je bent een aanpakker die graag buiten werkt;
Een vroege vogel bent, want over het algemeen starten wij om 07:00 uur op de projecten;
Bij voorkeur 40 uur (fulltime) per week beschikbaar bent;
Ambitie hebt om door te groeien naar een volwaardig grondwerker;
Een enthousiaste, leergierige en gemotiveerde collega bent!

Je levert een actieve bijdrage aan de totstandkoming van patenten.
Je legt je werkzaamheden helder en gestructureerd vast en presenteert je bevindingen binnen het team of naar andere afdelingen.
Je draagt bij aan innovatie binnen het volledige R&D-traject – van idee tot implementatie – en past daarbij moderne Agile-methodieken toe.


Wat bieden we jou?


Een fulltime bruto jaarsalaris tussen €63.300,- tot €90.440,- afhankelijk van jouw kennis en ervaring.
Een mooie bonusregeling.
27 vakantiedagen (mogelijkheid tot aankoop extra dagen).
Een zeer gunstige pensioenregeling.
Een afwisselende functie in een moderne werkomgeving.
Onbeperkt toegang tot online trainingen, zodat je aan je persoonlijke ontwikkeling kunt blijven werken.
Duurzaamheid is een belangrijk onderdeel van onze organisatie. Daarom planten, in samenwerking met Stukje Natuur, namens jou bomen voor lokaal natuurbehoud en bescherming van de biodiversiteit.
Voordelig sporten bij een geselecteerde sportschool.
Een heerlijke werkplek bij een succesvol en innovatief bedrijf: GNT is volop in beweging en dat zul jij ook zijn!


Wat heb je in huis?


Je hebt een universitaire opleiding (Master) in Levensmiddelentechnologie of een vergelijkbaar vakgebied afgerond.
Je hebt al enige ervaring opgedaan in product-/procesontwikkeling of een R&D-omgeving binnen de voedingsmiddelenindustrie.
Je hebt affiniteit met én ervaring in poedertechnologie en vloeibare emulsies.
Een achtergrond in droog-, maal- en dispersietechnologieën is een pre.
Je bent proactief en resultaatgericht, met een gestructureerde aanpak van probleemoplossing.
Je bent klant- en servicegericht en werkt zeer nauwkeurig.
Je kunt goed presteren onder druk in een dynamische en groeiende organisatie.

Build the Intelligence Layer for the AI Native Command Center

CRED is building the AI Native Command Center — a platform that helps businesses make smarter decisions by unifying internal and external data, enriching it with insights, and powering intelligent agents and workflows. From the PGA to global media brands, we’re helping forward-thinking teams automate strategy and predict the future.

We recently raised a $10M+ seed round and are growing quickly. At the core of our platform is a rich ecosystem of data and decision logic — powered by LLMs, retrieval systems, and domain-specific intelligence. As a Data Scientist at CRED, you’ll help design, build, and deploy these intelligent systems.

This is a rare opportunity to work at the intersection of applied AI, data infrastructure, and real business use cases.

What You’ll Do


Build and deploy models that power intelligent workflows — including LLM agents, ranking systems, and classification engines
Design and implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines that connect structured data with LLMs
Tune and evaluate foundation models (e.g. OpenAI, Claude, Mistral) for context-aware reasoning, summarization, and decision support
Work closely with product, engineering, and design to shape features that combine AI with user experience
Create evaluation frameworks, data labeling strategies, and feedback loops to improve model quality over time
Contribute to our internal LLM stack, including tools for memory, retrieval, grounding, and orchestration
Operate within weekly sprints, shipping production-ready work fast and iteratively


How We Work

We operate with speed and clarity. Our sprint cycles are weekly, our feedback loops are tight, and our goal is always shipping intelligence that delivers value. You’ll work across a collaborative team of engineers, PMs, and domain experts to bring AI to life.

What We’re Looking For


5+ years of experience in data science, applied ML, or AI product development
Strong understanding of LLMs, retrieval systems, and prompt engineering
Hands-on experience with RAG pipelines, embeddings, vector stores, and grounding strategies
Proficient in Python and popular ML/LLM frameworks (e.g. LangChain, OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
Familiar with designing, training, and evaluating models — supervised and unsupervised
Experience deploying models into production and building closed-loop systems
Strong communication skills and ability to work across disciplines
Passion for working in high-speed, early-stage environments


Bonus Points


Experience with real-world business applications of AI — sales, partnerships, ops, or customer intelligence
Knowledge of GraphQL, BigQuery, or backend systems
Experience building internal tooling for data annotation, model evaluation, or prompt iteration
Familiarity with tools like Pinecone, Weaviate, Redis Vector, or Vespa
Background in NLP, knowledge graphs, or multi-modal models


Why Join CRED?

At CRED, you’ll help invent the intelligence stack for how modern businesses operate. You’ll work with large-scale data, the latest in AI and LLM infrastructure, and a team obsessed with speed, quality, and purpose. If you're excited about building intelligent systems that actually get used — and used daily by the world’s leading organizations — we’d love to hear from you.

Apply now or contact us at careers@credplatform.com with any questions.

We are looking for multiple data scientists or machine learning engineers focusing on generative AI for text, and Large Language Models.

At Nordea, we see that the world is changing fast – and we want to be one step ahead of the curve. That’s why we’re deeply committed to providing the financial solutions of tomorrow to our customers. We’re creating an agile environment where we experiment and grow together – and we need your ideas and unique background. With us, you’ll be in good company with a chance to make your mark on something bigger.

About This Opportunity

Meet the AI & Machine Learning team. Our role is to improve how we detect and investigate financial crime with the help of AI and machine learning, to keep our customers, Nordea and society safe.

Our team is about 25 people working out of Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen as a part of the group financial crime prevention (GFCP) unit that provides financial crime prevention services to all of the bank.

Collaboration. Ownership. Passion. Courage. These are the values that guide us in how we work and how we make decisions – and that we imagine you share with us.

What you’ll be doing:


Prototype and explore the feasibility of new AI use cases in collaboration with business stakeholders
Implement, deploy, and monitor our AI applications
Rigorously evaluate and improve the quality of our AI applications
Keep up to date with the latest AI developments to shape our Gen AI best practices and tooling
Document models and processes to ensure compliance and meet our compliance and risk management standards


The role is based in Stockholm; Helsinki.

Who You Are

This is the right role if you have a passion to solve challenging problems - with the help of data, software and AI. As a person, you look past the noise, to do what is right. You prefer action to talking, but when you talk, people want to listen.

Your experience and background:


MSc or PhD in a field related to predictive or statistical modelling.
At least 2 years’ experience developing machine learning solutions in python, with a focus on model validation and explainability in a production grade system.
Exposure to multiple predictive AI projects, either through work or Kaggle or similar.
A knack for tackling complex problems and creating simple solutions.
Strong interpersonal communication and presentation skills, explaining complex ideas and technology across domains.


It would be ideal if you also:


Experience from working on AWS
Experience developing production grade code


What We Offer

People come here when they want to get somewhere. For some, it’s to take their career to the next level. For others, it’s to break new ground within their area of expertise – in other words, with us, you will always move forward.

A culture that fosters performance and growth in one of the largest Nordic banks, offering various opportunities to evolve, develop and learn from brilliant colleagues with diverse backgrounds in a vibrant working environment.

Hybrid working model – we believe in the value of bringing people together and at the same time we embrace the freedom of flexibility.

Diversity and inclusion are a natural part of our daily work. We know that an inclusive workplace is a sustainable one. We genuinely believe that our diverse backgrounds, experiences, characteristics and traits make us stronger together. Every day we strive to find new ways to improve diversity and inclusion within our community e.g. we have signed the European Diversity Charters in the countries where we operate to show our commitment and engage with others to continue learning and improving.

If this sounds like you, get in touch!

Vi skapar lösningar inom AI, Business Intelligence, Data Science och Automation för att maximera värdet av data och stärka företags konkurrenskraft. Vår styrka ligger i att kombinera passion för AI och data med en stark laganda, där vi stöttar varandra och löser utmaningar tillsammans.

Rollen som Data Scientist på B3

Hos oss får du chansen att jobba med några av Sveriges mest spännande kunder och projekt. Vad innebär det? Jo, att du får:


Gräva i data och hitta insikter som inte bara hjälper våra kunder – utan kanske till och med gör världen lite bättre.
Göra företag mer datadrivna och smartare genom att guida dem i rätt riktning.
Bygga och implementera avancerade lösningar – och faktiskt se dem göra skillnad!


Här handlar det inte bara om teknik – det handlar om att skapa verklig förändring. Vi gillar att tänka stort, experimentera och lösa kluriga problem tillsammans. Och det bästa? Du får ett team av grymma kollegor att bolla idéer med, lära dig av och ha kul ihop med!

Det är din passion för AI och data som gör skillnaden. Utöver det ser vi gärna:


Har du en universitetsutbildning inom matematik eller statistik? Toppen! Har du kanske skaffat motsvarande kunskaper genom arbetslivserfarenhet? Det funkar lika bra!
Minst 4 års relevant arbetslivserfarenhet – vi letar efter någon som har hunnit samla på sig en del erfarenhet inom området.
Flytande svenska och engelska – eftersom båda språken används dagligen i arbetet.
Tidigare konsultroller är ett plus! Har du jobbat som konsult tidigare? Då är det en extra merit, men inget krav.


Men framför allt...

Har du erfarenhet av Machine Learning och Python? Grymt – det är värdefullt! Men vi lägger också stor vikt vid din förmåga att se helheten, skapa användbara lösningar men framförallt att du är nyfiken. Om du dessutom har koll på A/B-testning, modellering eller visualisering, är det ett plus – men absolut inget krav.

Varför välja B3 Indes?

💡 Utveckling & karriär – Väx i en entreprenörsdriven miljö där din kompetens får ta plats.

🌿 Balans & välmående – Vi värnar om ditt välbefinnande med stöd för wellness och en flexibel vardag.

❤️ Vi bryr oss – på riktigt – Vi engagerar oss i samhällsfrågor och samarbetar med initiativ som Suicide Zero, My Dream Now och Pink Programming för att göra skillnad även utanför arbetslivet.

En arbetsplats som gör skillnad:

Vi är stolta över att ha utsetts till ett av Sveriges fem främsta karriärföretag 2025 – en utmärkelse som speglar vår energi, nyfikenhet och vårt engagemang för att skapa en inkluderande och inspirerande arbetsplats.

Filed is building the first AI tax preparer trusted by America’s accounting firms. This industry might seem boring—but it’s a $70B backbone of the economy that’s breaking under a talent shortage no one has solved. We’re fixing it—fast.

In just 9 months, we’ve hit strong product-market fit, are generating fast-growing, sticky revenue, and are backed by top-tier investors. We’re not a tool—we’re the missing workforce firms have been sounding the alarm for. We’re building the future with expanding our already 30 person team, with those who want to say “I was there when it all started.”

⸻

Here’s Why This Is a Terrible Job

This is not a job for someone who likes to move slow.

We operate week to week with ruthless speed. Sometimes we’re going in the wrong direction, but more times than not we’re going in the right direction.

If you need a few extra days to perfect your model, chances are there’s already a handful of team members blocked behind you.

We use tools like Cursor, OpenAI, and Gemini to prototype fast, test in prod, and push to users in hours—not quarters.

You’ll be operating at the intersection of large language models, user behavior, regulatory compliance, and structured knowledge graphs.

There are no clean datasets. No definitive papers. Just judgment calls, ambiguity, and noise from every direction.

You’ll ask yourself, is this really the work?

It is. And it’s not for everyone.

⸻

Here's Why It's The Best Career Choice You'll Make

We’re hyperscaling. We’re very well-funded. Generating very fast revenue, and have reached a strong product market fit score all within 9 months.

We’re building what tax pros call impossible. A product that behaves like a teammate, not just another tool.

We run reviews every 4 months. We operate with total transparency around pay, performance, and progress.

You’ll be paid above market. You’ll earn equity that grows fast.

And you’ll have full autonomy to make high-impact decisions.

You’ll ship models because you believe in them, not because they passed a review board.

You’ll talk to users weekly. You’ll drive outcomes end to end.

We’ll tell you the goal. How you reach it—prompting, fine-tuning, embeddings, retrieval, structured data—is up to you.

We expect you to build a customer Oracle. An internal simulator so precise it can predict what a user will ask, before they even ask it.

That comes from immersion, curiosity, and care.

⸻

The Teammate We're Looking For


Thinks in probabilities, systems, and second-order consequences
Navigates ambiguity across LLMs, APIs, and semi-structured corpora
Gets excited by the edge cases most people run away from
No research-for-research’s-sake — we ship fast and learn even faster
Big bonus if you’ve shipped AI products into production, not just demos


⸻

What You’ll Be Responsible For


Designing and implementing LLM-powered workflows across tax, finance, and compliance
Building agentic frameworks (adk, langchain, crewai and the likes)
Building and scaling Graphiti-like knowledge systems for memory and retrieval
Owning prompt pipelines, vector stores, fine-tuned models, and evals
Becoming an Oracle with a model of the customer and the domain in your head


⸻

Your Hard Skillset


Deep understanding of how LLMs actually work under the hood—beyond the hype
Fluency with APIs like OpenAI, Gemini, Claude; experience with structured evals
Comfortable working across Python beyond notebooks and can write production worthy services that handle millions of complicated documents and
Experience with cloud infra (GCP or Azure)
Strong grasp of embeddings, RAG, structured retrieval, and production-grade inference
Bonus if you’ve contributed to or built internal tooling for model debugging or evals


⸻

Your Soft Skillset


Ruthlessly pragmatic—knows when to ship and when to iterate
Empathetic with users and critical of vague assumptions
Deeply collaborative across product, engineering, and operations
Obsessively curious—you want to understand everything about the domain you’re automating
You own your outcomes—and love having your work in front of real users daily


⸻

Growth And Levels

We operate on six levels, from Level 1 to Level 6. Each reflects increasing ownership, impact, and scope with meaningful jumps in salary and equity.

We review levels every 4 months. Promotions are based on output and ownership, not tenure.

This isn’t a comfy AI role. It’s fast, focused, and brutally user-driven.

You will build fast. You will learn fast. You will own what you ship.

⸻

The process


Quick intro call
Code and system walkthrough + async technical task
Final round with our team
Optional 2 to 3 day paid trial
Then we decide together if this is the right fight


⸻

If you want to work with real users, real constraints, and build AI that goes far beyond chatbot demos—this is it.

Compensation Range: $71.5K - $149.5K

Aira is here to change that.

With our intelligent Aira Heat Pump at the heart, we’re making the switch to clean energy-tech easier and more affordable. Helping Europe turn off gas and slashing energy costs one home at a time.

Founded in 2022, and with 1000+ employees and counting, Aira is driving the clean energy revolution by providing homes with modern clean energy-tech solutions such as solar power, battery storage solutions, and heat pumps. With a state-of-the-art production facility in Poland, an HQ in Stockholm, Sweden, and hubs across the UK, Germany, and Italy, Aira is well on track to install clean energy-tech into 5 million homes by 2034.

About The Role 

Join our growing Energy Optimisation team as a Machine Learning Engineer (full-time, in-house) and help build and maintain the models that make up Aira’s intelligent home energy management system. By connecting our customers’ Aira devices - solar, batteries, heat pumps, and EV chargers - our system personalises energy management, adapts to customer preferences, usage patterns, and external factors like weather forecasts and energy tariffs, all with the mission to reduce energy bills and cut CO₂ emissions.

This role combines technical work with a product mindset. You'll dive into the details of machine learning models and energy optimisation, while also shaping the customer experience: how do we balance cost and comfort, how do we build trust in our intelligence, and how do we make our models understandable and explainable to our customers?

You’ll be joining a fast-moving, small team with high ownership. We’re looking for an ML Engineer comfortable working across the full data stack, who brings a product mindset, strong collaboration skills, and a drive to turn complex models into everyday value for our customers.

What You’ll Be Doing



Apply your mathematical and ML knowledge to solve real-world energy problems.
Develop optimisation models balancing dynamic tariffs, weather forecasts, customer behaviour, and preferences to achieve the perfect balance between cost savings and comfort for each individual customer and home.
Design, build, productionise, and iterate on Aira’s energy optimisation models
Collaborate with product designers, software, and hardware engineers to co-create features that will make our customers love their Aira products and save more money on their energy bills.
Test new approaches quickly, learn from results, and scale up the ones that make a difference



What You’ll Bring To The Role



You’re energized by fast-moving, product-driven environments where progress matters and the customer perspective guides our decisions.
You’re motivated by impact - what matters is not the perfect model, but the value it gives to the customer.
You have a background in machine learning, enjoy applying theory to develop real-world applications, with experience in reinforcement learning, general neural networks, and/or other methods relevant to personalisation and optimisation problems.
You have strong coding skills and have built ML systems in production, ideally using Python, Java, or similar. Familiarity with tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn is beneficial but not required.
You’re comfortable working with large-scale data pipelines, orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow), stream processing (e.g., Kafka), and cloud platforms (e.g., GCP or AWS).
You're ready to take initiative and accountability, and you're able to lead or contribute to high-stakes technical discussions.
You're open to working primarily from our Stockholm office



What is in it for you?



Gain hands-on experience in a fast-growing scale-up, with a supportive and inclusive culture, and career advancement opportunities.
Collaborate with diverse teams across international markets and launch products globally.
Develop and grow personally and professionally in an entrepreneurial-minded environment.
Thrive in a dynamic, solution-oriented culture, tackling challenges and driving meaningful solutions that make a positive impact on the world.
Influence the company's success, with a visible impact on product development and market growth.
Enjoy our brand-new office at Norra Stationsgatan 93 in Stockholm. Conveniently located near public transport, with Sankt Eriksplan and Odenplan stations just a few minutes walk away.



At Aira, we champion next-generation energy as well as diversity and inclusion. We firmly believe that a diverse workforce fosters innovation and creativity, enhancing our ability to serve customers and communities effectively. We welcome individuals from all backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives to join our team. Our commitment is to uphold equality and inclusivity, fostering a collaborative environment where everyone can thrive and contribute to a better future for our people and the planet.

Optimize GCP infrastructure and automate data workflows
Create dashboards to track KPIs like sales efficiency, waste, and restock accuracy
Work with ops and marketing to guide smarter planning and growth




What we’re looking for




We’re looking for someone who is not only technically strong but also collaborative, curious, and motivated by the real-world impact. You enjoy turning complex data into clear decisions, working across teams, and building systems that scale. And if you're someone who cares about sustainability - or just really loves good food - you’ll feel right at home at Veat.

• Vara en del i ett team med seniora kollegor där samarbete och innovation står i centrum.

• En öppen kultur där idéer och initiativ välkomnas.

• Möjlighet att arbeta med den senaste tekniken och spännande projekt inom sportspel, hästspel och casino.




Som Machine Learning Engineer kommer du att programmera och träna machine learning-modeller, vilket innebär både utveckling och förvaltning. Rollen innebär även att agera bollplank i organisationen för att identifiera och utvärdera potentiella appliceringar av machine learning.

Som person är du positiv, initiativrik och problemlösande. Du trivs i förändring, arbetar självständigt men är samtidigt en stark lagspelare som gillar att bygga relationer.




Vi ser att du har:

• Ett stort intresse för AI och Machine Learning.

• En vilja att lära dig nya tekniker och metoder och håller dig uppdaterad om utvecklingen inom AI och Machine Learning.




”Som ledare fokuserar jag på att bygga grupper där gemenskap, transparens, passion, nyfikenhet och humor är nyckelord.”

Jag har ett starkt intresse för produktutveckling, teknik och användarupplevelse. Som ledare fokuserar jag på att bygga grupper där gemenskap, transparens, passion, nyfikenhet och humor är nyckelord. Det ska vara roligt att gå till jobbet på måndagarna och man ska känna att man har lärt sig någonting nytt varje vecka. På fritiden tittar jag gärna på trav och allsvensk fotboll eller lagar mat.

- Rekryterande chef, Mikael Kudrén, Manager Product Lab.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The Team

In the Marketing Analytics team we are focused on improving the effectiveness of our marketing spend and help grow Wolt. We solve a variety of marketing challenges and help optimise Wolt’s marketing mix through attribution, MMM and Experimentation, enabling effective measurement of different marketing initiatives and working with the marketing team to identify areas for improvement and growth across all Wolt countries. Considering the scale of Wolt’s marketing function, there are many exciting problems to be solved and plenty of opportunities to make a business impact.

Data Scientists at Wolt work to uncover insights and turn them into relevant recommendations, driving decisions for the entire organisation. We partner closely with Marketing, Product, Engineering and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics and data science skills to drive business outcomes, we're looking for someone like you.

What you’ll be doing


Use statistical techniques, hypothesis testing, and experimentation to validate findings and drive business outcomes
Provide insights on marketplace dynamics, user behaviors, and long-term trends to our business
Conduct quantitative analysis and present data to uncover business drivers and insights beyond the numbers
Build analytics experiments, reports, and dashboards; perform ad-hoc data analyses using tools like SQL, R, or Python
Identify and measure levers to enhance metrics; make actionable recommendations
Offer clarity in ambiguous environments and collaborate across multiple teams and collaborate effectively across teams, including Marketing, Strategy & Operations, Product, Finance, and Engineering.
Mentor team members towards achieving actionable outcomes


Our humble expectations


5+ years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or related quantitative field
Skills in SQL queries, predictive modeling, and using visualization tools such as Looker or Tableau; experience with Python or R is a plus
Proficiency in experimentation techniques, including causal inference and A/B testing, with experience in experiment design and statistical analysis, with the ability to define success metrics and implement measurement strategies
A creative and critical mindset, thriving in fast-paced, dynamic environments to resolve ambiguous problems using a structured, hypothesis-driven, and data-supported approach
Strong interpersonal skills, with the ability to work cross-functionally and influence both technical and non-technical audiences and ability to lead strategic projects to completion with cross-functional teams in scrappy environments
Humility and a team-player attitude, going out of your way to help teammates
Familiarity with multi-sided marketplaces and working experience in marketing are a plus


What we offer


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can work onsite at our offices in Helsinki, Stockholm, or Tallinn. Alternatively, you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, or Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote, within the location above. 💙
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to the Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Merchant Group At Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation, and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Please note that we might have delays due to the peak holiday season.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities.

Would you like to be part of a team focused on solving real-world business problems by transforming our approach to how we work with data and AI/machine learning at scale at Danske Bank?

With clear ties to our Forward ’28 Group Strategy, Group Data & Analytics is now creating the foundation for leveraging data and AI/ML capabilities. We are currently ramping up to build a highly specialised team that partners with our core business and development teams to deliver solutions that elevate data-driven decision-making and add value to our portfolio of existing and new IT applications.

To do so, we have recently established an AI & Data Science team that will empower the organisation to leverage data and AI technologies to deliver business value and benefits.

Not only do we want to build things right, but just as importantly, we want to build the right things—which, in the era of AI and all the hype that comes with it, can be a challenge. You will play a key role in striking that balance.

As part of our migration to AWS, you will also be involved in moving to our future Data Science platform to help accelerate the impact of machine learning across Danske Bank. This will happen in close collaboration with peers in other teams across the organisation. You will promote clear directions for standards, best practices, and ways of working with data science as formulated by our team.

Depending on your experience and knowledge, we may offer you different levels of seniority in the role.

Please be informed that interviews will be held in mid-August.

About you:


Hands-on experimentation and proof-of-value in our lab environment
Scope and deliver end-to-end AI solutions
Guide and educate data scientists and data engineers throughout our organisation in relation to both methods and platform/tooling
Cultivate strong relationships with data scientists and business experts across the organisation


You will:


Outcome-oriented with a focus on solving problems
Effective communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to bring the right stakeholders together
Curious about product development and technology trends, with a keen interest in knowledge and self-improvement
Strong in mathematics, statistics, and machine learning
Experience with the following or similar technologies: Python, Spark/PySpark, Airflow, SQL, Public cloud providers, particularly AWSD, databricks, FastAPI, MLflow, Monitoring frameworks (g., Prometheus, Grafana), Containerisation (g., Kubernetes, Docker, OpenShift), CI/CD, pipelines, Git/Azure DevOps
Upper-intermediate English skills
Experience with Design Thinking or a similar UX framework would be beneficial

We offer:

This position can be located both in Lithuania and Denmark. If the position is located in Lithuania the monthly salary range will be from 2680 EUR to 4020 EUR gross (based on your competencies relevant for the job).

Additionally, each Danske Bank employee receives employee benefits package (benefits are only valid for Lithuania the same as the salary ranges) which includes:

Growth opportunities: professional & supportive team, e-learnings, numerous development programs; (incl. professional certificates); 100+ professions for internal mobility opportunities.

You will use Databricks notebooks hosted on our cloud servers to interact with S3 for exploratory data analysis, visualizations and modeling. This is done in PySpark (or SparkR) since the vast amounts of data truly require distributed computing.




This role is heavily focused on programming and model development, with approximately 80% programming and 20% math/statistics. While we use standard libraries for utilities, we rarely rely on high-level, pre-built model functions. Instead, our team develops models from first principles, focusing on algorithmic design and mathematical/statistical foundations.

While we appreciate diverse backgrounds, this position is not aligned with business analytics, qualitative research, or linguistics-focused skill sets.




Essential qualifications

You have a Master's degree or higher education in a numerically oriented education (Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, etc.). Candidates with a social science background, but specializing in statistics and data analysis, are also welcome to apply.
You have experience with data wrangling and analysis of large datasets and have developed a good intuition for how data can be used to create valuable insights.
You have a solid understanding of classical statistics techniques, for example descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and regression analyses.
You have programming/scripting skills. Our current toolbox includes Python and R. It is an advantage to have good knowledge of at least one of these languages, as the position is primarily programming-oriented.
You are curious, structured, and goal-oriented. You enjoy diving into complex issues but understand that the goal is to find workable solutions.
You can communicate your results in a non-technical manner and understand how to make complex data analysis useful for non-data scientists.

Further qualifications

Experience working with simulations, Bayesian statistics, and classical machine learning models, with a focus on understanding the underlying principles.
Experience with ""human-centered"" analysis and experience with analysing attitudinal data, such as survey and/or online behavioural data.
An ability to understand the business implications of data and analysis and how to use it to build a strategic story that engages and creates value for customers.
Coding hobby projects. We are interested in seeing what kind of programming related hobbies you have, or what kind of coding projects you have done in your spare time. This can be shared through a link in your CV/Cover letter.

Relevant working experience is viewed as a plus but is not a strict requirement.

Great coding skills
Skilled at both autonomous tasks and contributing to group efforts
Ability to examine details closely and critically




At Veo, you'll be part of a thriving work environment where every day brings new excitement. Our rapid growth ensures a diverse and ever-changing atmosphere. We believe in work-life balance and providing a positive culture that allows you to thrive personally and professionally.

Our Copenhagen office mirrors our innovative technology – with an indoor ball court, rooftop terrace, and well-equipped gym. We have created a facility that supports connecting disciplines across the business, facilitates creative thinking, and gives the space to engage with colleagues, our global partners, and the entire Veo community.

Diversity and differences are valuable assets for us. We value diversity and inclusion and welcome people from all backgrounds. If you’re excited about this role but your experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Values We Hold at Veo:

Dare - We take initiative, stay curious, and challenge the status quo in our work.

Own it - We drive impact by identifying opportunities, taking responsibility, and confidently executing.

Level up - We embrace growth, continuously learning and shaping our skills.

Play as a team - We collaborate across a diverse organization, leveraging shared insights for stronger outcomes.

Customer Centric - We deliver value by having close partnerships and a deep understanding of our customers (internally and externally)

We’re committed to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. And you may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Er du vild med økonomi, statistik og matematisk modellering? Trives du med at finde mønstre i data og omsætte dem til meningsfulde indsigter i Python – eller andre statistiske programmeringssprog? Så er det måske dig, vi leder efter. Vi søger en bachelor- eller kandidatstuderende, der ved siden af sin videregående uddannelse ønsker at være en del af regnekraften bag rådgivningen til Nordens største virksomheder.

Hvem er vi?

Choreograph er en del af WPP Media, som er Nordens største bureaugruppe. Vi arbejder med rådgivning inden for marketing, media og salg.

Jobbet

Vores kunder har store datasæt, komplekse problemstillinger og sammen skal vi omsætte de analytiske resultater til konkrete anbefalinger. En del af den tekniske udfordring er, at datamængderne konstant vokser og bliver stadig mere komplekse. Du skal være med til at løse denne udfordring. Sammen med en data scientist skal du på professionel vis håndtere kundens data, levere rådgivning og præsentere anbefalinger, som optimerer kundens investeringer baseret på et solidt analytisk grundlag.

Din daglige rutine som studentermedhjælper vil hovedsageligt være at opdatere, automatisere og klargøre data til analyser, samt opsætte indledende resultater i PowerPoint og PowerBI, alt imens du opbygger solid viden om branchen og de anvendte metoder.

Faglige og personlige kvalifikationer

Du er blandt årgangens skarpeste inden for økonomi, matematisk optimering, databehandling, statistik og/eller økonometri. Efter et introduktionsforløb, hvor du bliver fortrolig med vores anvendte datakilder og systemer, vil du selvstændigt arbejde med databehandlingen og udarbejdelse af præsentationer – i takt med, at du stifter bekendtskab med branchen, vil du få muligheden for at bistå i rådgivningen til virksomhederne og derved udvikle dine færdigheder som konsulent.

Vi forestiller os, at du:


Er i gang med en uddannelse, der giver et solidt fundament inden for økonomi og statistik
Har arbejdet med Microsoft Office-pakken (særligt PowerPoint og Excel), har kendskab til programmeringssprog som Python, og enten har erfaring med - eller interesse for - at arbejde med cloud-løsninger som Google BigQuery og SQL-baserede databaser
Er grundig, trives med at arbejde selvstændigt, og er god til at overholde deadlines
Har en vis forståelse for statistisk programmering og evt. dashboardløsninger


Vi tilbyder

Et fagligt udfordrende studiejob på ca. 15-20 timer om ugen i et engageret og dynamisk team med mere end 60 dygtige kollegaer fra hele Norden. Vi er en social gruppe, der holder af at tilbringe tid sammen uden for arbejdstiden blandt andet med padel, funktionel træning, karaoke, i fredagsbaren samt ture til udlandet, hvor vi til oktober planlægger en tur til Budapest.

Vi har højt til loftet og forventer at vores medarbejdere arbejder selvstændigt og er proaktive. Det er vores klare ambition, at du efter at have færdiggjort din uddannelse har mulighed for og lyst til at blive en del af vores organisation som fastansat.

Vores kontor ligger på Holmbladsgade 133, bag Kløvermarken på Amager, i gåafstand til Lergravsparken Metro. Vi har en fremragende kantine, hvor vi også tilbyder morgenmad, samt en masse sociale arrangementer i løbet af året, attraktive personalegoder og meget mere.

We are looking for multiple data scientists or machine learning engineers focusing on generative AI for text, and Large Language Models.

At Nordea, we see that the world is changing fast – and we want to be one step ahead of the curve. That’s why we’re deeply committed to providing the financial solutions of tomorrow to our customers. We’re creating an agile environment where we experiment and grow together – and we need your ideas and unique background. With us, you’ll be in good company with a chance to make your mark on something bigger.

About This Opportunity

Meet the AI & Machine Learning team. Our role is to improve how we detect and investigate financial crime with the help of AI and machine learning, to keep our customers, Nordea and society safe.

Our team is about 25 people working out of Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen as a part of the group financial crime prevention (GFCP) unit that provides financial crime prevention services to all of the bank.

Collaboration. Ownership. Passion. Courage. These are the values that guide us in how we work and how we make decisions – and that we imagine you share with us.

What you’ll be doing:


Prototype and explore the feasibility of new AI use cases in collaboration with business stakeholders
Implement, deploy, and monitor our AI applications
Rigorously evaluate and improve the quality of our AI applications
Keep up to date with the latest AI developments to shape our Gen AI best practices and tooling

The role is based in Stockholm; Helsinki.

Who You Are

This is the right role if you have a passion to solve challenging problems - with the help of data, software and AI. As a person, you look past the noise, to do what is right. You prefer action to talking, but when you talk, people want to listen.

Your experience and background:


MSc or PhD in a field related to predictive or statistical modelling.
At least 2 years’ experience developing machine learning solutions in python, with a focus on model validation and explainability in a production grade system.
Exposure to multiple predictive AI projects, either through work or Kaggle or similar.
A knack for tackling complex problems and creating simple solutions.
Strong interpersonal communication and presentation skills, explaining complex ideas and technology across domains.


It would be ideal if you also:


Experience from working on AWS
Experience developing production grade code


What We Offer

People come here when they want to get somewhere. For some, it’s to take their career to the next level. For others, it’s to break new ground within their area of expertise – in other words, with us, you will always move forward.

A culture that fosters performance and growth in one of the largest Nordic banks, offering various opportunities to evolve, develop and learn from brilliant colleagues with diverse backgrounds in a vibrant working environment.

Hybrid working model – we believe in the value of bringing people together and at the same time we embrace the freedom of flexibility.

Diversity and inclusion are a natural part of our daily work. We know that an inclusive workplace is a sustainable one. We genuinely believe that our diverse backgrounds, experiences, characteristics and traits make us stronger together. Every day we strive to find new ways to improve diversity and inclusion within our community e.g. we have signed the European Diversity Charters in the countries where we operate to show our commitment and engage with others to continue learning and improving.

If this sounds like you, get in touch!

What You’ll Do

We're a fast-moving team transforming financial operations and compliance using production-grade AI. This isn't a research lab, it's about building and shipping real tools that automate the hard stuff and make systems smarter, faster, and more reliable.




You will:

Build internal and external AI agents that automate workflows like invoice validation, reconciliation, KYC/AML checks, and compliance monitoring.
Use tools like GPT-4o, LangChain, n8n, Supabase, and custom Python/Node scripts to create end-to-end automations.
Translate deep domain knowledge from finance and legal into prompt-driven tools, backend logic, and APIs.
Connect your work to our core platform using REST APIs, webhooks, and third-party integrations.
Work closely with product and compliance teams to identify high-value use cases and execute fast.
Document and test your automations to ensure they scale across multiple clients and jurisdictions.
(Optionally) Build user interfaces with Retool, Lovable, or React to expose agent functionality.




Who You Are

You have 2–4 years of experience as a fullstack or backend developer.
You’ve built real AI-powered systems, agents, automations, wrappers, or workflows that do something useful.
You're confident with Python or JavaScript/TypeScript, and experienced with REST APIs and database development.
You’ve used tools like LangChain, GPT/OpenAI, Claude, Supabase, or n8n, and ideally connected them into working systems.
You enjoy solving real problems, shipping fast, and iterating based on feedback.
You understand how systems interact — tools, prompts, logic, APIs, and data flows.
Bonus: experience with finance, compliance, ERP integrations, or process-heavy industries.




Why Join Us

Work on real-world AI use cases, not demos or sandbox projects.
Join a small, highly capable, and product-driven team.
Ship and own projects that impact large, operationally complex organizations.
Help define how AI is used in an industry begging for modernization.
Enjoy a remote-first culture, fast decision-making, and real ownership over your work.

LLMs: GPT-4o, OpenAI Functions, Claude
Frameworks: LangChain, n8n, Supabase
Languages: Python, Node.js, TypeScript
Data & APIs: REST APIs (internal and external)
Frontend (optional): Retool, Lovable, React
Cloud: Multi-cloud (flexible based on context)




Compensation

Competitive salary tailored to your experience

Vi søger en AI Data Scientist, der vil være med til at sætte retningen for vores nye AI-satsning og skabe intelligente systemer baseret på LLM’er og AI-agenter - direkte ind i hjertet af vores tech-platform.




Om CEGO

CEGO er en ambitiøs softwarevirksomhed beliggende på havnefronten i Aalborg. Vi har en uformel arbejdskultur med højt til loftet, fleksibilitet og frihed under ansvar. Vi driver Spilnu.dk, et af Danmarks største online casinoer, og har udvidet vores succes til England med Happy Tiger. Vi udvikler alt in-house ved hjælp af open source-teknologier - både spil, platform og nu også vores AI-initiativer.




Om rollen

Vi søger en AI Data Scientist til en nyoprettet rolle på kontoret i Aalborg, hvor du skal udvikle fremtidens AI-løsninger med fokus på brug af Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-agenter og moderne AI-arkitekturer.




Det er en pionérrolle, hvor du bliver vores første specialist indenfor dette felt. Du vil bringe en ny teknologisk værktøjskasse med dig og forme, hvordan vi anvender AI hos CEGO. Samtidig vil du arbejde tæt sammen med vores dygtige udviklere i Platform-afdelingen, som bidrager med solid teknisk sparring.

Du bliver en del af vores Platform-afdeling, der består af 38 medarbejdere, herunder devops, softwareudviklere, UX-designere og frontend-udviklere.




Dine primære arbejdsopgaver omfatter:

Udvikle og implementere AI-løsninger baseret på LLM’er, AI-agenter og machine learning-teknikker såsom fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation), ReACT og meta-prompting
Designe og optimere agentbaserede systemer med teknologier som fx LangChain, LangGraph og LangSmith eller lignende
Udvikle API’er og integrationer til at forbinde AI-løsninger med vores eksisterende systemer
Deltagelse i innovation og prototyping på tværs af teams og forretningsområder
Holde dig opdateret på relevante AI-trends og vurdere, hvordan de kan anvendes til at skabe værdi for forretningen.




Om dig

Vi forestiller os, at du er en initiativrig holdspiller, der kombinerer din udvikler-profil med et kommercielt mindset, og at du desuden har:




Grundlæggende forståelse for machine learning og evnen til at skelne mellem klassiske ML-problemer og moderne LLM-applikationer
Kender til teknikker som prompt chaining og retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
Kendskab til agentbaserede AI-systemer og orkestrering af arbejdsgange
Erfaring med API-udvikling og softwareintegration
Erfaring med evaluering og performanceoptimering af AI-modeller
En nysgerrig og læringsorienteret tilgang til nye teknologier




Vi tilbyder

Mulighed for at blive en del af en af Aalborgs mest attraktive og ambitiøse arbejdspladser. Vi kombinerer en stærk faglig kultur med høj grad af frihed og ansvar.




En forretning, hvor kunderne er slutbrugerne på vores websites. Vi definerer således selv vores målsætninger, og i hvilken retning vi skal arbejde for at lykkes
Ingen tidsregistrering af arbejdsopgaverne
En agil, flad organisation med hurtige beslutningsveje
Fleksible arbejdstider, 30 minutters betalt daglig pause og en politik om nul overarbejde
Fælles morgenmad, adgang til fitnessrum, personlig træning to gange om ugen og massage
Et arbejdsmiljø hvor faglighed, trivsel og samarbejde går hånd i hånd
Sundhedsforsikring og pensionsordning




Vi ved, at dygtige og engagerede medarbejdere skaber de bedste resultater. Derfor gør vi en aktiv indsats for at sikre et arbejdsmiljø, hvor du både bliver udfordret og trives.

Virksomhedsbeskrivelse

CEGO A/S har eksisteret siden 2000 og driver i dag en række datterselskaber med forskellige online casinoer i såvel Danmark som internationalt. I 2012 lancerede vi Spilnu.dk, og vi var blandt de første der fik en casino-licens fra Spillemyndigheden, da den danske spillovgivning blev liberaliseret.




Spilnu.dk er unikke spillemaskiner, som alle er udviklet og produceret in-house. De er baseret på den klassiske ""enarmede"" fra spillehallen, som er tilsat en god dosis bonusspil, som giver en ekstra dimension til den klassiske spiltype og masser af ekstra underholdning. På Spilnu.dk er der fokus på hyggen og det sociale, hvor spillerne kan chatte med hinanden, mens de spiller.

Foruden Danmark opererer vi i UK, hvor du finder os under brandet Happy Tiger. CEGO A/S er ejet af tre Aalborgensiske iværksættere og VIA equity.




Du finder os i vores inspirerende kontor på havnefronten i Aalborg, hvor vi beskæftiger cirka 130 medarbejdere indenfor alt lige fra spiludvikling, webudvikling, spil- og lyddesign, grafik og kundeservice til serveradministration samt platform drift og -udvikling. Dertil kommer en række understøttende afdelinger i form af Compliance & Legal, Marketing, Økonomi og HR.

Tech-first. Ego-free. User-obsessed. We’re Skatteguiden – the independent advisor for 1 million Danes (and counting), starting with tax and now taking on the broader world of personal finance.




We’re not tied to strategic partners, investor KPIs or slow-moving hierarchies. We're profitable, well-funded, and accountable only to our users. That gives us a rare superpower: clarity.




We’re a tech company at heart. That means tight teams, direct execution, and continuous delivery. We build fast, break well, and learn obsessively. We ship meaningful products, not fluff – and we win together.







About This Opportunity for AI Engineer




We’re on a mission to make private economy simple — starting with taxes and now expanding across the entire private economy.




To support the growth of our AI efforts, we’re looking for a full-time AI Engineer to join us in Copenhagen — helping us bring the same clarity and simplicity to personal finance that we’ve already delivered in tax, and make it easier for people to understand and navigate their personal finances.




Our AI Tax Assistant has already handled close to 100,000 tax-related conversations since January, helping users get answers and guidance instantly.




We’re now ready to take our use of AI to the next level by designing and deploying intelligent AI agents and ML-driven products — capable of delivering contextual guidance, user interactions, and unlocking entirely new experiences across personal finance.




You’ll lead efforts to design and deploy AI/ML pipelines and LLM-powered agents — unlocking new, intelligent features across the private economy. You’ll be part of a small, focused, cross-functional squad (Product, Backend, Frontend, UX) working towards a shared goal.




You’ll work closely with our Data Product Lead, who brings deep user, data product, and transaction data understanding. Together, you’ll scope, build, and deploy AI solutions that help people understand and improve their private economy — offering insights, nudges, and personalized guidance based on real financial behaviour.




You’ll also collaborate with our current AI Engineer to enhance our AI Tax Assistant, improve its intelligence and contextual relevance, and jointly work on foundational infrastructure such as:




Creating infrastructure for our LLM MCP server
Designing ML workflow architecture
Setting up a modern and scalable ML platform




With nearly 1 million users in Denmark, our platform already serves a large share of the population. Your work will directly impact people’s financial lives — bringing clarity, relevance, and everyday guidance to those who need it most.







Key Responsibilities




Design and Build AI Solutions: Develop AI-driven models and algorithms from scratch, focusing on intelligent transaction data processing and enrichment.
Integrate AI into Product Workflows: Build features powered by AI components (e.g. LLMs, vector embeddings, classifiers) that seamlessly plug into user-facing products and back-end systems.
Own the Full Lifecycle: Take end-to-end ownership — from scoping and prototyping, to deployment, testing, and iteration.
Work with Real Systems, Not Just Models: Ensure your solutions are well-integrated into existing systems, business logic, and user journeys, with robust data flow and performance.
Collaborate Broadly: Work closely with the Data Product Lead, AI Engineer, Dev engineers, and designers to align AI development with user value and organisational priorities.
Maintain and Evolve: Actively test, maintain, and improve AI features over time, and contribute ideas for improving our overall AI setup, architecture, and capabilities.
Stay Ahead: Keep up with the evolving AI landscape and propose improvements to systems, workflows, or tooling where relevant.







Your Experience




Practical AI Experience: You’ve worked with AI technologies like LLMs and prompt engineering — ideally in product-oriented contexts.
ML modelling capabilities: You have experience with the ""classical ML workflow""; collecting data, feature engineering, model selection and parameter tuning. Much work these days is done using LLM models, but you should also have experience working with other areas within the AI field.
Engineering Craft: You can design and implement scalable systems, with strong coding skills in Python (Java or similar languages also welcome).
Data Infrastructure Awareness: You understand how data moves and how AI systems depend on clean, structured input and effective deployment environments.
Lead with Ownership: You're comfortable taking the lead on complex problems, balancing experimentation with delivery.
System Thinker: You consider architecture, performance, and maintainability when designing AI solutions.
Collaborative by Nature: You’re comfortable working across teams, communicating openly, and solving problems together.
Relevant Background: A degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field is helpful, but not required if you bring the right experience and mindset.







Our Lean Recruitment Process




30-minute screening call with our recruiter, Christian Payne
1-hour onsite meeting with hiring manager Casper (Chief Data Officer) and Nicolai (Data Product Lead)
1-hour onsite case session, where you'll present a small case to Casper (CDO), Nicolai (Data Product Lead), and have a follow-up conversation with Nikolai (CEO)







Here is the transparency on the dates of our interview stages:

Screening calls take place over 2 weeks - July 28th - August 8th
1st interviews take place in the week of August 11th to August 15th
2nd interviews with case take place in the week of August 18th to August 22nd







If you're excited to build AI that helps nearly 1 million Danes better understand and navigate their personal finances, we’d love to hear from you.

We’ll help you succeed in a globally connected powerhouse of diverse teams and take your career wherever you want it to go.

Join EY and help to build a better working world.

About The Job

At the EY’s digital product organization, you will be building intelligent tax automation tools and agentic AI platforms for increased efficiency, quality, and joy in tax and compliance workflows.

We help thousands of clients with services such as producing correct and compliant tax filings, and consulting multinational companies on how to navigate the international tax landscape.

To do those jobs with the highest degree of accuracy and efficiency, intelligent automation and great AI-powered software play key roles.

We operate across the Nordics (DK, FI, SE, NO) with a small, flat, and informal organization of ~40 engineers, designers, researchers, and PMs. In a distributed setup across all countries where we work from home and offices depending on preferences and needs.

Tax? Yes, tax filings and tax law are the domains we design and build for, so having an interest in those areas would be good. Actual experience and domain knowledge is of course a plus, but certainly not a requirement. It's a pretty small Venn diagram of ML engineers who also have professional tax experience.

Above all, we value working with good all-round people. People who are both highly specialized but are capable of collaborating across disciplines.

About You

As an ML/AI engineer, you will be entrusted with building intelligent automation systems and agentic AI platforms across several business-critical tax products.

As a master of your craft, you will develop production-ready ML models, NLP pipelines, and AI agents using Python, Langchain, and modern transformer architectures.

Solutions that are well-tested, documented, optimized for performance, and easy to maintain.

You have honed those skills by working on ML applications in cross-functional product teams, where you have shown yourself as a wonderful collaborator who can translate business requirements into intelligent technical solutions.

You have likely also done many model reviews and taken initiative to question AI approaches suggested by people more senior in the company than yourself. And challenged product decisions that didn't make technical sense from an ML perspective.

If that sounds like you, we should talk. In the meantime, here's more information about the work and our team.

Your Key Responsibilities


Building intelligent tax automation systems using ML/AI technologies
Developing agentic AI platforms for Nordic tax regulations and compliance
Close collaboration with tax professionals, designers, product managers, and fellow engineers
Spending time, occasionally, with users and domain experts to understand tax workflows in detail
Working across a range of products and problem spaces in the tax domain
Freedom to work remotely or in our Copenhagen or Stockholm office


Skills And Attributes For Success

To qualify for the role, you should have:


ML/AI Fundamentals: Experience with supervised/unsupervised learning, classification, entity extraction, document processing, and time-series analysis
NLP Expertise: Proficiency with transformer models, embeddings, document analysis, and Named Entity Recognition
Python Stack: Strong experience with Langchain, Ragas, OpenAI API, and modern ML frameworks
Production Experience: 2+ years deploying ML models as REST APIs with async processing capabilities
Database Skills: Experience with MongoDB and vector databases, particularly for document and financial data modeling
Cloud Platforms: Familiarity with Azure AI Foundry or similar cloud ML platforms
Security Awareness: Understanding of data privacy, security requirements, and compliance frameworks (SOX, PCI)
Easy access to Copenhagen, Helsinki, or Stockholm. You can work remotely most of the time, but we meet up in person weekly
Really good English speaking and writing skills. That's our work language
An interest in tax law and financial regulations


What We Look For

We obviously want you to be a skilled ML engineer, but we believe that a engineer is so much more than that. We are looking for a colleague who is…


A real craftsperson and a stickler for technical details
Delightful to be around and able to communicate ML concepts to non-technical stakeholders
A clear communicator who can translate between tax domain experts and technical teams
Supportive and helpful in cross-functional collaboration
Quick to solve complex problems with practical engineering solutions
Questioning AI approaches and decisions before committing to implementation
Eager to learn about both advancing ML techniques and tax domain complexities
Comfortable working in 6-week Shape Up cycles with autonomous project ownership


What We Offer


A tech product team: Digital product organization as a unit operates mostly product- and user-driven, even though we are situated within a large consultancy organization
Direct access to domain experts: Your ML models will directly impact tax professionals who are quite literally right next to you, providing immediate feedback and domain insights
Cutting-edge AI challenges: Work on agentic AI platforms and intelligent automation in a regulated, high-stakes environment
Shape Up methodology: Work in focused 6-week cycles with clear scope and autonomy
Good food and good times: We take good care of the people who dedicate their working hours to our cause
Diverse and inclusive culture: You'll be embraced for who you are and empowered to use your voice to help others find theirs

At WasteHero, we're on a mission to build the most advanced, intelligent municipal software platform in Europe. Our customers are cities and waste companies – the backbone of public life – and we help them digitize operations, optimize resources, and become smarter every day. Now, we're ready to go AI-first. And we need a builder.

We're looking for a Fullstack AI Engineer who can combine classic engineering skills with modern AI tooling to ship real, production-grade AI agents, flows, and tools – fast. This isn't a research role. This is about building things that work.

What You’ll Do


Build internal AI agents that automate everything from public tender qualification to API-based integration flows.
Use OpenAI (GPT-4o), LangChain, n8n, Supabase, and custom Python/Node scripts to develop real, end-to-end flows.
Translate domain knowledge (from product, integration, support) into prompt-based tools, scripts, and interfaces.
Develop backend logic and connect with our main platform via REST APIs, webhooks, and Supabase.
Collaborate directly with our founder, product team, and engineers to prioritize high-impact use cases.
Document and test your agents so they can scale across customers, countries, and products.
Optionally: build or connect frontend UIs via Lovable, Retool, or React.


Who You Are


You have 2–4 years of experience as a fullstack or backend developer.
You've already built real things with AI – agents, automations, internal tools, or API wrappers. (We’re not looking for beginners.)
You're comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript or Python, REST APIs, and database logic.
You’ve used tools like LangChain, GPT, Claude, Supabase, or n8n — and ideally connected them together.
You love shipping fast, learning fast, and solving real customer problems.
You think in systems. You see the flow between tools, prompts, users, and data.
Bonus: experience with public infrastructure, tenders, waste, logistics, or ERP systems.


Why Join Us


Work on real-world AI problems — not gimmicks.
Be part of a small, ambitious, and product-driven team with deep market traction.
Ship and own projects that get used by municipalities and companies across Europe.
Help define how AI is applied in one of the most operationally complex and underserved domains: waste & city infrastructure.
Enjoy full autonomy, fast feedback loops, and the ability to shape the product and stack.
Located in Aarhus? Great. Prefer hybrid or remote (within CET ±2)? Also great.


Tech Stack You’ll Touch


GPT-4o / OpenAI Functions / Claude
LangChain / n8n / Supabase
Python / Node.js / TypeScript
REST APIs (internal and customer)
Lovable / Retool / React (optional)
Other tech stacks that can improve efficiency


Compensation


Competitive salary based on experience
Equity/warrants
Office in Aarhus C with hybrid flexibility
Real ownership. No bureaucracy.

Her er en meningsfuld opgave, hvor du gør en forskel gennem nærvær og tydelighed.

Om opgaven

En skøn 7-årig dreng glæder sig til gode eftermiddagstimer sammen med dig efter skole og i nogle weekender. Han har infantil autisme, er snakkesalig, har en god hukommelse og elsker alt fra Lego og Minecraft til Pokémon-jagt på telefonen.

På hverdage henter du familiens el-ladcykel i hjemmet og cykler hen for at hente ham fra skole (ca. 2 km hver vej). Resten af tiden bruger I på hans yndlingsaktiviteter – det kan være leg derhjemme, ture på legepladsen eller fx et besøg i legeland i weekenden.

Drengen trives bedst med tydelige rammer og har brug for støtte til at forstå sociale signaler. Jeres samvær foregår i et roligt tempo, hvor du sætter rammen og følger hans initiativer.

Vær opmærksom på, at der er kat i hjemmet.

Om dig

Du har kendskab til autisme og er god til at skabe struktur. Du har tålmodighed, kan bevare roen og arbejder anerkendende med drengen i centrum. Du kan være pædagog eller ufaglært med relevant erfaring.

Arbejdstid

Stillingen er på ca. 45 timer om måneden fordelt sådan:


Hverdage: Mandag og torsdag kl. 13.15–16.15 (ca. 25 timer/måned)
Weekender: Vagter efter aftale, typisk ca. 20 timer/måned


Stillingen er ledig fra slutningen af september.

Vi tilbyder

Du bliver en del af en familieejet virksomhed med en masse engagerede medarbejdere. Du har en fast rådgiver, som du altid kan få sparring hos.

What You’ll Do

We're a fast-moving team transforming financial operations and compliance using production-grade AI. This isn't a research lab, it's about building and shipping real tools that automate the hard stuff and make systems smarter, faster, and more reliable.




You will:

Build internal and external AI agents that automate workflows like invoice validation, reconciliation, KYC/AML checks, and compliance monitoring.
Use tools like GPT-4o, LangChain, n8n, Supabase, and custom Python/Node scripts to create end-to-end automations.
Translate deep domain knowledge from finance and legal into prompt-driven tools, backend logic, and APIs.
Connect your work to our core platform using REST APIs, webhooks, and third-party integrations.
Work closely with product and compliance teams to identify high-value use cases and execute fast.
Document and test your automations to ensure they scale across multiple clients and jurisdictions.
(Optionally) Build user interfaces with Retool, Lovable, or React to expose agent functionality.




Who You Are

You have 2–4 years of experience as a fullstack or backend developer.
You’ve built real AI-powered systems, agents, automations, wrappers, or workflows that do something useful.
You're confident with Python or JavaScript/TypeScript, and experienced with REST APIs and database development.
You’ve used tools like LangChain, GPT/OpenAI, Claude, Supabase, or n8n, and ideally connected them into working systems.
You enjoy solving real problems, shipping fast, and iterating based on feedback.
You understand how systems interact — tools, prompts, logic, APIs, and data flows.
Bonus: experience with finance, compliance, ERP integrations, or process-heavy industries.




Why Join Us

Work on real-world AI use cases, not demos or sandbox projects.
Join a small, highly capable, and product-driven team.
Ship and own projects that impact large, operationally complex organizations.
Help define how AI is used in an industry begging for modernization.
Enjoy a remote-first culture, fast decision-making, and real ownership over your work.

LLMs: GPT-4o, OpenAI Functions, Claude
Frameworks: LangChain, n8n, Supabase
Languages: Python, Node.js, TypeScript
Data & APIs: REST APIs (internal and external)

We’re delighted to be working with one of Europe’s most exciting tech startups, as they continue their mission to become the leader in their market.




They’re looking to onboard an experienced backend engineer, to join one of their internal teams.




The Role




In this role, you'll be working as part of the Business Ops team - which focuses on internal processes, developer tools & creating the best possible work environment for both technical & non-technical team members.




You'll work closely with a team of engineers as well as non-technical stakeholders, before crafting innovative solutions to every day problems.




You'll be using Python, with Django being used as their main framework. Whilst this specific role is purely backend focused, they do have space for a Full Stack Engineer in the near future - so don't hesitate to reach out if you have solid TypeScript experience too.




What You’ll Bring




5+ years of commercial software engineering experience
3+ years of experience working with Python
Demonstratable experience of working with internal teams with non-technical staff
Any experience in TypeScript is a plus, but certainly not required




The Company




With a current team of over 400 and huge growth planned in the next few years, this is an opportunity to get in while the rocket ship’s still near the launchpad.




Their tech is used by tens of thousands of teams across the globe every week—helping analysts record, analyse, and improve performance with ease.




The company’s mission is a positive and inclusive one: to ensure access to performance tools, regardless of background, budget, or location.




Their Copenhagen HQ is the coolest office I’ve ever visited, so I’m sure you’ll agree. Most of their team are onsite between 3-5 days a week. They offer flexibility on remote working, but their staff like being in the office more often than not.

CALL IT A PLAN

Som salgselev i YouSee tilrettelægger du dit arbejdsliv efter dit liv.

Har din sport en vigtig plads i dit liv, hepper vi på dig.

Spiller selvforkælelse en stor rolle i dit liv, får du råd til det hos os.

Og er det vigtigt for dig, at arbejdslivet er mindst lige så fedt som resten af dit liv, så skab din egen succes som YouSee’s nye salgselev.

HOLDÅND ER FUNDAMENTET

FOR VORES SUCCES

Som ny elev træder du direkte ind i vores butiksboble. Og du skal være med til at gøre den endnu bedre. Dine kompetencer og høje ambitioner får en markant rolle i at udvikle butikken og give kunderne en uovertruffen oplevelse, der gør, at de kommer igen og igen.

Udover at betjene og rådgive kunder bliver du bl.a. også inddraget i driftsopgaver, deltagelse på events og besvarelse af support-kald på telefonen.

Teamet i butikken bliver dit hold. I er som et professionelt sportsteam; I er passionerede for det I laver, og I fokuserer på individuel såvel som på fælles performance. I går målrettet efter at løfte jer selv og hinanden til nye højder. I foretrækker det går stærkt, og det skal være fedt imens!

Samtidig får du en leder i butikschefen, hvis vigtigste opgave er at skabe et miljø, hvor du og dine kollegaer har plads til succesfuldt at udvikle jer - både som individer og som team. Butikschefen har ofte selv startet karrieren som elev og vil med sin erfaring kunne coache og støtte dig på rejsen.

DU FÅR I GNS. +3.000 KR.

I PROVISION SOM SALGSELEV

Du påvirker selv din løn. I hvert fald den del, der udgør provisionen. Og der er ikke noget loft over den provision, du kan lægge ovenpå din grundløn hver måned.

Provisionen sikrer, at du bliver belønnet for dine præstationer – ikke kun på salget, men på massevis af områder.

Vil du have meget mere til luksus en måned? Sigt højt og gå målrettet efter at gøre en ekstraordinær indsats. Det betaler sig!

EKSKLUSIVT MEDLEM

I VORES PLUSCLUB

Du får fede fordele i lommen. Som elev i YouSee får du adgang til appen PlusClub. Her optjener du dagligt point. Point scores når du f.eks. sælger telefoner, abonnementer og tilbehør. Du kan derfor selv være med til at påvirke, hvor hurtigt dine point fordobler sig!

Pointene kan bruges på en lang række af de apps, du sikkert allerede bruger i forvejen: JustEat.dk, Miinto og Nordisk Film Biografer for bare at nævne nogle få.

KARRIERE MED

PLADS TIL LIVET

Du får plads til livet ved siden af arbejdet. Din butik bliver din base, og forhåbentlig kommer du til at elske at være i den. Men du har også et liv uden for den. Det ved vi. Og derfor tilbyder vi stor fleksibilitet i den måde, vi tilrettelægger dit arbejde på. Hvis du går til fodbold eller dans om onsdagen, tilpasser vi din vagtplan til det. Og hvis du skal til familiefødselsdag samtidig med en vagt, så hjælper holdet i butikken hinanden med at bytte vagter.

Arbejdet er ikke hele dit liv. Og dit arbejde hos YouSee skal ikke stå i vejen for resten af dit liv.

Hvad kræver det for at blive elev på Danmarks fedeste elevhold?

For at få direkte adgang til vores uddannelse skal du have en baggrund i EUD Detail, HHX eller EUX. Har du en STX, HF eller HTX, skal du blot supplere med et 5 ugers EUS-forløb. Derudover forventer vi, at du er motiveret, engageret og tager din uddannelse seriøst.

Hvordan bliver dit skoleforløb?

Du er på skoleophold 10 gange af en uges varighed i løbet af de to år, uddannelsen varer, og her tager alle cases udgangspunkt i YouSee’s egen forretning - og ofte også fra den butik, du selv er elev i. Det giver dig mulighed for at omsætte det, du lærer i skolen, direkte i din hverdag i butikken.

På skolen træner du salg, præsentationsteknik, økonomi og markedsføring, så du bliver dygtig til at levere verdens bedste kundeoplevelse. Du vil derfor også opleve, at du hurtigt bidrager til dit team og i butikken.

Send din ansøgning i dag – vi glæder os til at lære dig at kende!

Ansøgningsfrist: 1. September 2025

Startdato: Senest 01/09/2025

          <strong>DON'T CALL IT A DREAM<br><br>CALL IT A PLAN <br><br></strong>Som salgselev i YouSee tilrettelægger du dit arbejdsliv efter dit liv.<br><br>Har din sport en vigtig plads i dit liv, hepper vi på dig.<br><br>Spiller selvforkælelse en stor rolle i dit liv, får du råd til det hos os.<br><br>Og er det vigtigt for dig, at arbejdslivet er mindst lige så fedt som resten af dit liv, så skab din egen succes som YouSee’s nye salgselev.<br><br><strong> HOLDÅND ER FUNDAMENTET<br><br>FOR VORES SUCCES<br><br></strong>Som ny elev træder du direkte ind i vores butiksboble. Og du skal være med til at gøre den endnu bedre. Dine kompetencer og høje ambitioner får en markant rolle i at udvikle butikken og give kunderne en uovertruffen oplevelse, der gør, at de kommer igen og igen.<br><br>Udover at betjene og rådgive kunder bliver du bl.a. også inddraget i driftsopgaver, deltagelse på events og besvarelse af support-kald på telefonen.<br><br>Teamet i butikken bliver dit hold. I er som et professionelt sportsteam; I er passionerede for det I laver, og I fokuserer på individuel såvel som på fælles performance. I går målrettet efter at løfte jer selv og hinanden til nye højder. I foretrækker det går stærkt, og det skal være fedt imens!<br><br>Samtidig får du en leder i butikschefen, hvis vigtigste opgave er at skabe et miljø, hvor du og dine kollegaer har plads til succesfuldt at udvikle jer - både som individer og som team. Butikschefen har ofte selv startet karrieren som elev og vil med sin erfaring kunne coache og støtte dig på rejsen.<br><br><strong> DU FÅR I GNS. +3.000 KR.<br><br>I PROVISION SOM SALGSELEV<br><br></strong>Du påvirker selv din løn. I hvert fald den del, der udgør provisionen. Og der er ikke noget loft over den provision, du kan lægge ovenpå din grundløn hver måned.<br><br>Provisionen sikrer, at du bliver belønnet for dine præstationer – ikke kun på salget, men på massevis af områder.<br><br>Vil du have meget mere til luksus en måned? Sigt højt og gå målrettet efter at gøre en ekstraordinær indsats. Det betaler sig!<br><br><strong> EKSKLUSIVT MEDLEM<br><br>I VORES PLUSCLUB<br><br></strong>Du får fede fordele i lommen. Som elev i YouSee får du adgang til appen PlusClub. Her optjener du dagligt point. Point scores når du f.eks. sælger telefoner, abonnementer og tilbehør. Du kan derfor selv være med til at påvirke, hvor hurtigt dine point fordobler sig!<br><br>Pointene kan bruges på en lang række af de apps, du sikkert allerede bruger i forvejen: JustEat.dk, Miinto og Nordisk Film Biografer for bare at nævne nogle få.<br><br><strong> KARRIERE MED<br><br>PLADS TIL LIVET<br><br></strong>Du får plads til livet ved siden af arbejdet. Din butik bliver din base, og forhåbentlig kommer du til at elske at være i den. Men du har også et liv uden for den. Det ved vi. Og derfor tilbyder vi stor fleksibilitet i den måde, vi tilrettelægger dit arbejde på. Hvis du går til fodbold eller dans om onsdagen, tilpasser vi din vagtplan til det. Og hvis du skal til familiefødselsdag samtidig med en vagt, så hjælper holdet i butikken hinanden med at bytte vagter.<br><br>Arbejdet er ikke hele dit liv. Og dit arbejde hos YouSee skal ikke stå i vejen for resten af dit liv.<br><br><strong>Hvad kræver det for at blive elev på Danmarks fedeste elevhold? <br><br></strong>For at få direkte adgang til vores uddannelse skal du have en baggrund i EUD Detail, HHX eller EUX. Har du en STX, HF eller HTX, skal du blot supplere med et 5 ugers EUS-forløb. Derudover forventer vi, at du er motiveret, engageret og tager din uddannelse seriøst.<br><br><strong>Hvordan bliver dit skoleforløb? <br><br></strong>Du er på skoleophold 10 gange af en uges varighed i løbet af de to år, uddannelsen varer, og her tager alle cases udgangspunkt i YouSee’s egen forretning - og ofte også fra den butik, du selv er elev i. Det giver dig mulighed for at omsætte det, du lærer i skolen, direkte i din hverdag i butikken.<br><br>På skolen træner du salg, præsentationsteknik, økonomi og markedsføring, så du bliver dygtig til at levere verdens bedste kundeoplevelse. Du vil derfor også opleve, at du hurtigt bidrager til dit team og i butikken.<br><br>Send din ansøgning i dag – vi glæder os til at lære dig at kende!<br><br><strong>Ansøgningsfrist:</strong> 1.

Vil du være med til at forme fremtidens inspektionsarbejde med avanceret droneteknologi – og samtidig blive en del af et lille, stærkt team i vækst?

Hos Drone Eksperten søger vi en ny kollega, der ikke kun har teknisk nysgerrighed og gåpåmod, men som også er afbalanceret, ansvarsfuld og kan bevare roen i pressede situationer. Du skal have lyst til at tage medansvar for den generelle drift, herunder både droneoperationer, databehandling, rapportering og vedligehold af udstyr.

Vi er en ung virksomhed med base i Kolding og har specialiseret os i inspektion med droner i lukkede og svært tilgængelige rum – fx kedler, tanke, siloer, skakte og rørføringer. Med teknologier som Elios 3 er vi blandt pionererne på det danske marked. Vores løsninger skaber stor værdi for kunderne ved at gøre inspektionsarbejdet sikrere, hurtigere og mere datadrevet.

Din rolle

Som vores nye kollega bliver du en nøglespiller i både planlægning, udførelse og kvalitetssikring af droneinspektioner. Du vil udføre flyvninger med vores Elios 3-droner i komplekse og lukkede miljøer og være ansvarlig for, at hver opgave er grundigt forberedt – herunder adgangsforhold, sikkerhedsforanstaltninger og risikovurdering. En del af jobbet er feltarbejde hos kunder i hele Danmark og til tider i nabolande, så du skal være klar på at være på farten et gange om ugen.

Efter flyvningerne står du for at overføre, strukturere og analysere data samt udarbejde de rapporter, som danner grundlag for kundernes beslutninger. Du får ansvar for vedligeholdelse og rengøring af droner og udstyr og er samtidig med til at sikre, at vores leverancer lever op til den høje kvalitet, vi er kendt for. Når tekniske udfordringer opstår, er du i kontakt med supportteams hos vores leverandører.

Samtidig bliver du en aktiv medspiller i udviklingen af vores virksomhed. Du følger med i nye teknologier, bidrager til at optimere vores interne processer og hjælper med at udvikle fremtidige arbejdsmetoder og løsninger. Hos os bliver dine idéer taget alvorligt, og din rolle kan vokse i takt med, at virksomheden vokser.

Vi Forestiller Os, At Du


Er stabil, rolig og ansvarsbevidst – også når tingene er nye eller komplekse
Har en teknisk nysgerrighed og lyst til at lære nyt udstyr og software
Trives med en kombination af praktisk arbejde og kontor arbejde
Har let ved at tale med både kunder og kolleger
Har B-kørekort og bor i (eller vil flytte til) området omkring Kolding
Er fleksibel i forhold til arbejdstider og klar på at tage på opgaver rundt i landet


Hvad tilbyder vi?

Hos Drone Eksperten bliver du en del af en ambitiøs og fagligt stærk virksomhed i vækst, hvor du får mulighed for at præge både din egen rolle og vores samlede udvikling. Du får en hverdag med stor variation – fra feltarbejde og databehandling til procesforbedringer og udvikling af nye løsninger. Vi arbejder med nogle af markedets mest avancerede droner til indendørs inspektion, og du bliver grundigt oplært i både teknologien og de metoder, vi bruger.

Vi lægger vægt på frihed under ansvar og korte beslutningsveje. Du kommer tæt på ledelsen og får indflydelse på både opgaver og retning. Vi er en virksomhed i vækst - og for den rette person er der derfor mulighed for at vokse ind i en lederrolle over tid.

Du vil desuden have mulighed for at deltage i relevante kurser, konferencer og messer, så du kan udvikle dig fagligt i takt med, at vi udvikler vores virksomhed.

At WasteHero, we're on a mission to build the most advanced, intelligent municipal software platform in Europe. Our customers are cities and waste companies – the backbone of public life – and we help them digitize operations, optimize resources, and become smarter every day. Now, we're ready to go AI-first. And we need a builder.

We're looking for a Fullstack AI Engineer who can combine classic engineering skills with modern AI tooling to ship real, production-grade AI agents, flows, and tools – fast. This isn't a research role. This is about building things that work.

What You’ll Do


Build internal AI agents that automate everything from public tender qualification to API-based integration flows.
Use OpenAI (GPT-4o), LangChain, n8n, Supabase, and custom Python/Node scripts to develop real, end-to-end flows.
Translate domain knowledge (from product, integration, support) into prompt-based tools, scripts, and interfaces.
Develop backend logic and connect with our main platform via REST APIs, webhooks, and Supabase.
Collaborate directly with our founder, product team, and engineers to prioritize high-impact use cases.
Document and test your agents so they can scale across customers, countries, and products.
Optionally: build or connect frontend UIs via Lovable, Retool, or React.


Who You Are


You have 2–4 years of experience as a fullstack or backend developer.
You've already built real things with AI – agents, automations, internal tools, or API wrappers. (We’re not looking for beginners.)
You're comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript or Python, REST APIs, and database logic.
You’ve used tools like LangChain, GPT, Claude, Supabase, or n8n — and ideally connected them together.
You love shipping fast, learning fast, and solving real customer problems.
You think in systems. You see the flow between tools, prompts, users, and data.
Bonus: experience with public infrastructure, tenders, waste, logistics, or ERP systems.


Why Join Us


Work on real-world AI problems — not gimmicks.
Be part of a small, ambitious, and product-driven team with deep market traction.
Ship and own projects that get used by municipalities and companies across Europe.
Help define how AI is applied in one of the most operationally complex and underserved domains: waste & city infrastructure.
Enjoy full autonomy, fast feedback loops, and the ability to shape the product and stack.
Located in Aarhus? Great. Prefer hybrid or remote (within CET ±2)? Also great.


Tech Stack You’ll Touch


GPT-4o / OpenAI Functions / Claude
LangChain / n8n / Supabase
Python / Node.js / TypeScript
REST APIs (internal and customer)
Lovable / Retool / React (optional)
Other tech stacks that can improve efficiency


Compensation


Competitive salary based on experience
Equity/warrants
Office in Aarhus C with hybrid flexibility
Real ownership. No bureaucracy.


Ready to build the future of public infrastructure with AI?

ZOE is the science and nutrition company leading a movement to transform the health of millions.

We exist because the food we eat is making us sick. Most of what we are taught about food is wrong.

ZOE runs the world’s largest nutrition science study to find scientifically proven solutions.

Our randomised controlled trial of ZOE proves that if you eat the right food for your body, you can feel healthier in weeks and be on track for more healthy years.

ZOE can change the way you eat, feel, and live. We host world-leading scientists on our podcast and bring proven science to your plate with Daily30+, our 30+ plant supplement.

Over 100,000 people rely on ZOE Membership, our personalised nutrition program, to make smarter food choices. ZOE Membership turns complex science into clear step-by-step actions, helping you improve your health with every meal.

ZOE means life — and you can change your life with food.

Visit our career page and become a ZOEntist 🚀

🚀 The Role

As a Data Scientist at ZOE, you will partner with world-class nutrition scientists to turn cutting-edge research into robust scoring algorithms and science-driven features, and to build ML/AI models that leverage our extensive members’ data to improve user experience and health outcomes.

This role is perfect for someone passionate about nutrition, health tech, or biology, or someone with the curiosity and drive to dive in and learn quickly.

Unlike a classical “fit-the-model” data science role, you’ll also engineer bespoke models that embed expert knowledge, validate them rigorously on real-world data, and ship production-ready code that powers the ZOE experience. You’ll collaborate daily with scientists, engineers, and product teams—moving fast and iterating quickly based on strong but not perfect evidence (:70 %) because speed beats perfection in a startup.

👥 The Team

You’ll be joining the Data Science team at Zoe. The team spends most of its time embedded in stream-aligned product teams while regularly setting aside a smaller portion of its schedule to drive high-impact, cross-cutting data science initiatives for the wider organisation.

Your home base will be the Scoring team—a cross-functional team of product managers, engineers, scientists, and data scientists that sits at the nexus of research and product. You’ll join a squad that prizes intellectual honesty, rapid experimentation, and our #ActFast ethos—working hand-in-hand with PhD scientists to turn hypotheses into deployed models.

🎯 What You’ll Be Doing


Design, iterate, and deploy scoring algorithms for foods, diets, metabolic responses, and microbiome profiles.
Translate expert food statements (e.g., ‘High-glycaemic foods raise blood glucose responses’) into model features and Python functions.
Build, test, and maintain clean, production-ready code in Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), and SQL/DBT/BigQuery/Airflow.
Build ML/AI models to improve food coverage and categorisation, ingredients extraction, food recommendations, and more.
Design validation frameworks that blend scientific rigour (e.g., hold-out tests, bootstrapping, sensitivity analyses) with pragmatic speed.
Partner with engineers to shape data contracts and ensure pipelines deliver the granularity, latency, and quality your models require.
Present results using decks, dashboards, or Looms to support data-driven product decisions.
Take full ownership of your work, brining entrepreneurial spirit and work proactively.
Champion our scientific yet agile approach: start with a hypothesis, seek evidence, and iterate fast.



🧠 What You’ll Bring To The Table


3+ years of professional experience in data science, ML engineering, or quantitative research.
A degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Applied Maths, Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Statistics, Computer Science).
Solid grasp of machine learning (e.g. training and evaluating standard models) and statistical techniques (e.g. running hypothesis testing).
Experienced in contributing to production-level Python codebases, developing new components and features, writing moderately complex SQL queries, and using Git for version control.
Experience turning domain knowledge (rules, heuristics, scientific findings) into engineered model logic.
A track record of shipping production code and collaborating in cross-functional, fast-paced environments.
Comfort using AI tools to enhance day-to-day productivity—from IDEs with AI assistants to prompt engineering.
Strong communication and collaboration skills—from delivering clear presentations to stakeholders to conducting deep-dive code reviews and working collaboratively across functions.
Must have a passion for nutrition, health tech, biology, or a strong desire to dive in and learn quickly.
A commitment to our #ActFast value: optimise for reversible decisions, take smart risks, and move quickly with imperfect data.



🌟 Bonus Points


Experience with causal inference and advanced statistical modelling.
Experience with building AI features using LLMs and evaluation frameworks.
Exposure to MLOps best practices.
Knowledge of microbiome data, ---omics pipelines, or biomarker analytics.

🎉 Offer



If everything clicks, we’ll move to offer quickly and transparently. You'll always know where you stand and what comes next.

The experience, skills, and attributes listed above reflect what we believe will contribute to success in this role. If you're passionate about ZOE and the opportunity, but don't meet 100% of the criteria, we still encourage you to apply. We are committed to supporting growth and are happy to offer up-skilling opportunities where possible.

Remote Philosophy

ZOE is a remote-first company, meaning remote work isn’t just an option — it’s how we work best. We are intentional about building a distributed, high-performing team where collaboration, trust, and flexibility thrive.

We design our workflows around asynchronous communication and shared documentation to support autonomy, focus, and cross-timezone collaboration. While our teams work independently, connection and teamwork remain central to how we operate — through regular rituals, meaningful virtual interactions, and in-person gatherings every quarter. These include team offsites and a yearly company-wide retreat to build relationships, spark creativity, and have fun together.

Being remote-first also means we value outcomes over hours and trust our team members to manage their work in a way that suits their unique rhythm and responsibilities. This approach allows us to support a truly flexible work environment, while staying aligned with our mission and values.

At ZOE, working remotely doesn’t mean working alone — it means being empowered, supported, and connected, wherever you are.

Compensation Philosophy

We are committed to offering competitive and equitable compensation that reflects the value of each role and aligns with regional labor market standards. Our approach to compensation goes beyond just base salary — we offer a comprehensive package that includes base pay and stock options, ensuring that every team member is rewarded for their contributions to the company’s growth and success.

We believe that building a thriving team requires not only providing fair and competitive compensation but also fostering an environment where success is shared collectively. Our total compensation package is designed to support the well-being of our employees, recognise their individual contributions, and empower them to grow alongside ZOE.

Benefits & Perks

We understand the significant role our benefits play in motivating, inspiring and safeguarding our employees' well-being. Our benefits strategy is thoughtfully designed to echo our mission and values, recognising the diverse needs arising from different life stages of our ZOEntists.

Our approach to benefits takes an inclusive and flexible view of both personal and professional growth. From competitive health insurance and wellness packages to inclusive parental policies, building connection, and tailored professional development programs, we've got you covered.

At ZOE, we continue to build a benefits package that invests in our team members’ long-term personal and professional growth and wellbeing, adding to this list as it evolves.

Equal opportunities

We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive team where every individual can bring their authentic self to work. We believe that this is key to our success and are dedicated to positively impacting the tech industry. As part of our commitment to equal opportunities, we encourage candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to apply. We ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all and do not discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, marital status, disability, or age. If you require any accommodations during the interview process, please feel free to inform us, and we will make every effort to support your needs.

Backed by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, the IPA, and Sky, Barb has been the source of official TV viewing figures for decades. 




Barb is uniquely placed to empower transformation of the UK TV and advertising ecosystem through reliable and accurate data.  




These data fulfil three purposes:  




To support decisions that are made in the making and distribution of great programmes.  
To support the planning and buying of ad campaigns and informing on brand and sales outcomes.  
To inform how broadcasters and other media services operate in the public interest. 




As the media industry evolves, so does Barb. We've expanded our measurement beyond traditional panels to incorporate large-scale online data and streaming services. Through our campaign reporting tools, Barb also provides the full picture of cross-platform pre and post campaign reporting. 




Our hybrid approach combines people-based panel data with census-level device data to deliver inclusive measurement of total identified viewing across all platforms, services, and devices. This empowers broadcasters, advertisers, and regulators to make more better, fairer, more informed decisions. 




Overview 

We’re seeking a Junior Data Scientist to help build the future of UK audience measurement. This is a unique opportunity to join a small, expert team of 13, reporting directly to the Head of Data Science and working on foundational systems used by major media organisations across the UK. 




You can expect to work on high-impact projects including: 




The Barb Data Hub, a centralised Snowflake data warehouse serving as the single source of truth for Barb data. You’ll help develop a library of reusable analysis tools. 
Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Sharing – ensuring users can apply Barb’s complex methodologies efficiently and accurately. 
Barb Panel Plus, a new system integrating “return path data” from TV sets and set-top boxes with existing panel data. 




These projects pose exciting challenges from the point of view of data engineering, statistical modelling, and software development. This role will be of interest to someone starting their career as a data scientist and excited by the prospect of finding brilliant solutions to these problems.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be.

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Role Overview:

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalization.

What you will be doing:

You’ll join a London-based agile team building and supporting data science products that drive business impact across PlayStation. You’ll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to serve teams such as marketing, operations, engineering, product planning, R&D, and finance.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Help drive data literacy across the business
Collaborate with a high-performing team of data scientists to apply insights and drive innovation throughout the company.


Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

What you'll be doing:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience
Experience applying data science techniques such as supervised/unsupervised learning, segmentation, forecasting, causal inference, and uplift modelling
Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:


Experience with data science tooling (e.g., workflow orchestrators like Airflow, feature stores)
Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)
Private Medical Insurance
Dental Scheme
25 days holiday per year
On Site Gym
Subsidised Café
Free soft drinks
On site bar
Access to cycle garage and showers

Recruitment Fraud

Cyber criminals advertise fake job adverts with prestigious employers as a way of stealing information or even defrauding individuals out of money. In the most sophisticated cases, they will set up fake websites, which have a similar address to companies like Unilever. They even conduct fake telephone interviews and then offer candidates a role with the proviso they pay a fee for background checks or to cover work visa costs.  These types of attacks are becoming more common as more people are looking for employment in the economic climate.

How is Unilever tackling this?

Many of Unilever’s recruitment sites publish a warning to candidates about recruitment fraud. The Cyber Security team also proactively scan for signs of people setting up fake Unilever sites and act to close them down.

What can I do?

If you become aware of potential recruitment fraud, spot fake Unilever recruitment adverts or fake LinkedIn profiles, report them via Una Live Chat.

Unilever does not accept responsibility or liability for any candidates who are financially impacted by recruitment fraud. Your vigilance is key!

We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements
