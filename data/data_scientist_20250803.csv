LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The best choice for anyone who takes investing seriously:

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

pHera is closing the gender health gap!

Most existing vaginal pH test strips are analog, low-resolution, visually subjective, and

poorly suited for women’s health applications. Doctors need fast, reliable tools to

help with complicated diagnoses. Women deserve clarity, not guesswork when

managing their vaginal health from home. A high-resolution pH test can catch

imbalances early, making it easier to monitor issues like bacterial vaginosis,

recurring vaginal infections, sexually transmitted infections, ovulation, PCOS, and

menopause. By building pHera, you would be building a tool that would advance women's health.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Bolt's Experimentation Platform team is seeking a Senior Data Scientist to spearhead innovation in hypothesis testing and causal inference across the company.

About Us

With over 200 million customers in 50+ countries, Bolt is one of the fastest-growing tech companies in Europe and Africa. And it's all thanks to our people.

We believe in creating an inclusive environment where everyone is welcome, regardless of race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability.

Our ultimate goal is to make cities for people, not cars, and we need your help to achieve this mission!

About The Role

Our mission is to build a world-class experimentation ecosystem. You will be at the forefront, researching cutting-edge methodologies, building proofs-of-concept (PoCs), and collaborating to bring these innovations to life. Your initial focus will be on critical projects like improving our test design methodology and rolling out ML-powered variance reduction methods into production. Future areas of exploration include advanced holdout strategies, sequential testing, variance reduction techniques, and estimating treatment effects in marketplace experiments.

This role is ideal for you if you’re interested in a mix of technical work and collaboration, and working on a diverse range of interesting problems across the company. If you think you fit this profile, but are unsure about whether you meet other criteria, please apply, and we can discuss!

Main tasks and responsibilities:


Research, prototype, and validate novel statistical methods for A/B testing and causal inference relevant to Bolt's challenges.
Develop PoCs for new methodologies, working closely with our two dedicated data engineers to support moving successful concepts into production.
Drive the democratization of experimentation by improving self-serve tooling, developing educational materials, and providing direct consultation to product teams.
Collaborate closely with engineers and product managers to translate advanced statistical methods into robust, scalable platform features used by hundreds of people across Bolt.
Work closely with Data Science and Analyst teams across all verticals to prioritize your research agenda and drive experimentation best practices throughout the company.
Effectively communicate complex statistical concepts and experiment results to stakeholders of different levels of data literacy when needed, from Data Scientists and Analysts, to Product Managers, Engineers, and leadership.



About you:


2+ years of experience working in the tech industry in a Data Scientist/Analyst or Economist role
Be able to translate novel methods from research papers on experimentation and causal inference into PoCs.
Deep understanding and practical application of Statistical Hypothesis Testing and A/B Testing / Randomized Controlled Trials (including advanced techniques).
Strong stakeholder management skills, notably collaborating with and influencing Data Scientists and Analysts.
Proficiency in R or Python (we work in Python, but this can be acquired) and SQL.
Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.
Accelerate your professional growth with unique career opportunities.
Get a rewarding salary and stock option package that lets you focus on doing your best work.
Enjoy the flexibility of working in a hybrid mode with a minimum of 3 days in the office each week to foster strong connections and teamwork.
Take care of your physical and mental health with our wellness perks.
Some perks may differ depending on your location and role.

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

Backed by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, the IPA, and Sky, Barb has been the source of official TV viewing figures for decades. 




Barb is uniquely placed to empower transformation of the UK TV and advertising ecosystem through reliable and accurate data.  




These data fulfil three purposes:  




To support decisions that are made in the making and distribution of great programmes.  
To support the planning and buying of ad campaigns and informing on brand and sales outcomes.  
To inform how broadcasters and other media services operate in the public interest. 




As the media industry evolves, so does Barb. We've expanded our measurement beyond traditional panels to incorporate large-scale online data and streaming services. Through our campaign reporting tools, Barb also provides the full picture of cross-platform pre and post campaign reporting. 




Our hybrid approach combines people-based panel data with census-level device data to deliver inclusive measurement of total identified viewing across all platforms, services, and devices. This empowers broadcasters, advertisers, and regulators to make more better, fairer, more informed decisions. 




Overview 

We’re seeking a Junior Data Scientist to help build the future of UK audience measurement. This is a unique opportunity to join a small, expert team of 13, reporting directly to the Head of Data Science and working on foundational systems used by major media organisations across the UK. 




You can expect to work on high-impact projects including: 




The Barb Data Hub, a centralised Snowflake data warehouse serving as the single source of truth for Barb data. You’ll help develop a library of reusable analysis tools. 
Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Sharing – ensuring users can apply Barb’s complex methodologies efficiently and accurately. 
Barb Panel Plus, a new system integrating “return path data” from TV sets and set-top boxes with existing panel data. 




These projects pose exciting challenges from the point of view of data engineering, statistical modelling, and software development. This role will be of interest to someone starting their career as a data scientist and excited by the prospect of finding brilliant solutions to these problems. The role would be well-suited to someone who is a talented coder, logical thinker, enjoys working with data, has an interest in the TV industry, and is looking to grow into their career as a data scientist. 




Key responsibilities 




Work closely with the Barb executive team and partners to understand and implement the Barb Calculation Methodology, which is a complex set of conventions and algorithms that describe how to use Barb panel data to calculate standard audience metrics. 
Build and maintain a shared library of reusable data analysis tools for Barb’s users and suppliers. 
Support users of Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Share, ensuring they produce correct and industry-standard outputs. 
Translate parts of the methodology into reliable, production-ready Python code for use across Barb’s systems. 
Contribute to the evaluation and development of statistical and machine learning models for return path data integration. 
Develop ELT pipelines and modelling solutions for data integration projects. 

 




Qualifications 




A degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., STEM, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics). 
Good working knowledge of Python and SQL. 
Experience with Python data packages (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) preferred. 
Strong mathematical and statistical foundation. 
Ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with others. 

 

Experience 




The ideal candidate will have some experience with: 

Data engineering; working with databases, building infrastructure for moving, storing, and processing data.  
Modelling; analysing data using statistical or machine-learning techniques 




Preferred: 

Experience with Snowflake, or other cloud data platforms such as Databricks or BigQuery. 
Familiarity with Snowpark or similar distributed computing frameworks such as Spark. 

For graduates, the above could include projects done at university or during an internship. 




 




Benefits 




Base salary will reflect the responsibilities of the role and be commensurate with experience. Barb offers a discretionary bonus scheme alongside the following benefits. 




Office in central London – with hybrid working options 
Pension contributions up to a maximum of 9% of salary — employees’ contribution matched +3% 
Five weeks paid holiday — rising to six weeks after 10 years’ service 
Holiday purchase scheme — purchase up to five additional days in any calendar year 
Group Life Assurance — four times annual salary 
Group Income Protection — 75% of salary after 26 weeks absence 
Enhanced pay for parental/adoption leave after 18 months of service — 13 weeks at 100% of basic salary followed by 26 weeks at the statutory rate

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:

Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

What you'll be doing:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.

Bonus: experience in at least one of the following areas:
Working with Marketing Mix Models (MMMs)
Practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) or NLP
Understanding of web technologies and identifiers (e.g. cookies, device IDs, MAIDs, etc.)

Ben jij gek op dingen die je met het blote oog niet ziet?

Bacteriën. Ze zijn klein, ze zijn overal en ze zijn jouw passie. Voor jou is het geen besmetting, maar een ontdekking. Waar anderen enkel ‘schoon’ zien, zie jij cultuur. En je weet: een goede dag begint met een gramkleuring.

Achter iedere patiënt schuilt een verhaal — soms zichtbaar, maar vaak pas onthuld na kweek en microscopie. Als Analist medische microbiologie speel jij een essentiële rol in het achterhalen van infectieuze verwekkers. In ons diagnostisch laboratorium werk je dagelijks met patiëntmateriaal. Je zet kweken in, beoordeelt groei, voert identificaties uit en test gevoeligheden. Met elk betrouwbaar resultaat lever je een directe bijdrage aan de juiste diagnose en behandeling.

Wij zoeken geen standaard kandidaat, maar iemand met een vaste hand, scherp analytisch vermogen en een hart voor de zorg. Werk jij graag nauwkeurig, denk je in kolonies en wil je écht iets betekenen in de patiëntenzorg, zonder zelf aan het bed te staan?

Dan maken we graag kennis met jou.

Bij de medische microbiologie werken 6 artsen-microbioloog en 30 analisten. Analisten rouleren over de verschillende werkplekken en combineren handmatige met geautomatiseerde onderzoeken. Wij werken onder meer met de MALDI Biotyper, de WASP en de Phoenix.

Jouw werkdag

Je begint met een begroeting van je collega’s, waarna je aan de slag gaat.


Je onderzoekt zelfstandig verschillende soorten patiëntmaterialen.
Het ontvangen en controleren van patiëntmateriaal hoort bij toerbeurt tot je werkzaamheden.
Je rouleert wekelijks over verschillende werkstations.
Je bent verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit en technische uitvoering van verschillende onderzoeken.
Je rapporteert de uitslagen in het laboratorium informatie systeem GLIMS.


Jouw kwaliteiten


Je bent een echte aanpakker: je laat je niet afschrikken door een grote werkvoorraad.
Je bent stressbestendig: dus ook onder tijdsdruk blijf jij georganiseerd en nauwkeurig werken. Zorgvuldig werken is voor jou vanzelfsprekend.
Je toont initiatief, staat open voor innovatie en denkt mee om het proces continu te kunnen verbeteren.
Je hebt een sterk verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel: je denkt niet in kweken of testen, maar in patiënten.
Je bent iemand die van nature goed is georganiseerd.


Wij vragen


Je beschikt over een HLO/Life Science diploma richting medische microbiologie.
Bij voorkeur heb je al gewerkt of stage gelopen op een medisch microbiologisch laboratorium.
Je vindt het geen enkel probleem om mee te draaien in de weekend- en avonddiensten. Uiteraard houden we hierbij rekening met jouw eigen wensen.

Build the AI behind tomorrow’s workforce.




Every day, millions of non-desk workers show up, ready to achieve. Behind their success stands Dyflexis - because even champions need smart systems to stay ahead. At Dyflexis, we build workforce management solutions that keep hotels, stores and factories running smoothly. Simple, practical, and just what you need. No unnecessary complexity, no wasted time. Just straightforward tools that work where you work.




More than software

What truly sets us apart isn't just what we build, it's who we are: bold minds who dream big, build smart, and win together. We embrace Dutch directness because sugar-coating slows progress. Some people love the fire in our belly, others prefer to play it safe. We're looking for the bold and brave ready to build something extraordinary. Sounds like you?




As our AI Engineer, you’ll strengthen our Innovation Lab by building, scaling and refining smart planning features, from auto-scheduling to long-term forecasting. Features that deliver real impact for thousands of non-desk teams across Europe.




This is what you'll do

You’ll work in focused project squads (with a Product Owner, UX Designer and fellow Engineers) to build, test and scale AI features that directly improve workforce planning. You’ll work in six-week sprints of focused building, followed by two weeks of cooldown to gather feedback, refine features, and prepare for the next big win.




Your closest sparring partner will be Jord, our pioneering AI Engineer. Together, you’ll tackle challenges like scaling auto-scheduling for all clients, training ML models in the cloud, and tailoring industry-specific workflows. You’ll decide when retraining is needed, speed up Shift-Assign, and experiment with long-term demand prediction (3–12 months). You’ll lead technical initiatives, translate research into scalable solutions, and work cross-functionally with product and customer-facing teams. And as Dyflexis expands internationally, you’ll help grow both the AI team and the technology that powers it.




This is what you need

3+ years of experience with mathematical optimization (linear programming/constraint programming) or operations research, or econometrics
Strong background in machine learning, AI engineering, and data-driven development
Comfortable translating research into clear, scalable solutions
Experience with Python, cloud and tools like OR-Tools, Gurobi
Familiarity with CI/CD workflows (plus!)
A structured mindset with a pragmatic approach to real-world complexity
Ability to lead technical projects, collaborate cross-functionally, and own your work
Fluent in English; Dutch is a plus




This is the important part

A salary up to €6,000 per month
25 vacation days plus your birthday off in exchange for cake
8% holiday allowance
Solid pension plan
Personal development budget
Option to buy or sell vacation days
Travel allowance
Daily chef-cooked lunches at HQ
Free membership at ARJ Boxing Gym
Friday chair massages
The best team parties, drinks, and trips (think winter sports, Ibiza and more)




Ready to turn big ideas into real product impact?

Apply by clicking the big blue button. No cover letter needed – just answer a few quick questions and send us your CV in English. We will get back to you within three days and tell our chef to set an extra plate.

Willen wij écht iets veranderen in de jeugdzorg of het speciaal onderwijs, dan komen we er niet met een beetje samenwerken.

Bij ons krijg je de ruimte om out-of-the-box te denken, je creativiteit los te laten op het lesprogramma en écht verschil te maken. Geen dag is hetzelfde, elke les is een nieuwe kans om jongeren te laten groeien—fysiek én mentaal.

Wat bieden wij jou?


Een betekenisvolle rol waarin jij écht het verschil maakt voor jongeren die jouw steun goed kunnen gebruiken.
Een tijdelijk dienstverband van 24 uur (meer of minder is bespreekbaar), met uitzicht op een vast contract.
De kans om vanaf de basis mee te bouwen aan een innovatieve onderwijsvoorziening.
Een hecht en betrokken team binnen het OOV-netwerk dat samenwerkt aan de beste ondersteuning voor onze leerlingen.
Een salaris volgens cao PO, schaal LC (€ 3.484,- tot € 6.149,- bruto per maand).
Volop ruimte voor jouw professionele ontwikkeling én eigen ideeën.


Wat vragen wij van jou?


Je bent in het bezit van een lesbevoegdheid tot gymdocent;
Je hebt affiniteit en aantoonbare ervaring met onze cluster 4 doelgroep;
Je biedt onze leerlingen houvast en structuur zodat zij zich zo optimaal mogelijk kunnen ontwikkelen;
Je hebt natuurlijk overwicht, bent in staat individueel verbinding te maken en zo snel duidelijk te krijgen wat elke leerling nodig heeft;
Je weet (verbaal) agressief gedrag te de-escaleren en de hulpvraag van de leerling te herkennen;
Je creëert samen met jouw teamgenoten synergie in het belang van de leerling en voor een positief werkklimaat.
Kom je bij ons werken? Dan vragen wij om een VOG (verklaring omtrent gedrag).


Wat ga je doen?

Als Gymdocent Voor Onze Leerlingen In De Leeftijd Van 15 Tot Ca.19 Jaar, Speel Je Een Cruciale Rol In Hun Ontwikkeling. Je Brengt Niet Alleen Sport En Beweging In Hun Leven, Maar Ook Structuur, Discipline En Belangrijke Levensvaardigheden. Wat Maakt Deze Baan Zo Uniek

BAAN · FULLTIME · ROTTERDAM




THERMELEON | Richting klimaatneutrale glastuinbouw




Ons product – de Thermeleon Warmtebatterij – is een innovatieve etmaalbuffer voor kassen. Het verbetert de energie-efficiëntie van kassen door de overtollige warmte strategisch te hergebruiken tijdens de dag-nachtcyclus. Zo verlagen we het aardgasgebruik substantieel en is er een hogere klimaatgelijkheid over de kas heen. In deze rol zet je grotendeels zelfstandig experimenten en analyses op en voert ze – samen met de rest van de R&D-afdeling – uit. Dit omvat tests naar de prestatie, het materiaal en de chemische eigenschappen van verschillende productvarianten. Je analyseert de resultaten en koppelt die onder andere terug aan de Product Design engineer. Je hebt ook de vrijheid om mee te denken over het (toekomstige) productontwerp. In alle stappen zul je nauw samenwerken met je collega's, met een gevarieerde achtergrond (Business, Scheikunde, Bouwkunde, Natuurkunde Werktuigbouwkunde). Binnen de baan is er ook ruimte om op hoger level strategisch mee te denken over de productontwikkeling-strategie.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.

Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
4 weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 days of the year
