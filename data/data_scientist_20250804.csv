About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Strong business judgment and a knack for identifying the signal in noisy data with context of the overall business implications
Excellent verbal communication and presentation skills to stakeholders, leadership, and investors
Experience working in an environment where you have to balance rigor and speed, knowing when to push for perfection vs. ship and iterate

We are training foundation models from scratch, designing new reasoning architectures, and deploying them on state-of-the-art GPU clusters. This is not fine-tuning someone else’s work. This is building from first principles.

As an AI/ML Engineer, you’ll be part of the team that makes this real. You’ll work on both sides of the problem: how models are trained and how they run in the world. You’ll design and build the systems that power large-scale training runs and efficient inference. You’ll work closely with our AI Researchers to implement the latest algorithms and ideas.

This is a deep engineering role. You’ll be writing a lot of code, instrumenting systems, optimizing performance, and debugging weird, messy edge cases in distributed training and model serving. If you love figuring out how foundation models really work under the hood, this is your team.

We’re expanding our global network of Maincoders by establishing a new Seattle office. Join us in shaping this hub from day one while collaborating closely with our Melbourne headquarters to push forward the frontier of AI research and engineering.

What You’ll Do


Build and scale training pipelines for sovereign foundation models like large language models and other architectures
Design efficient inference systems that run these models in real-world environments
Optimize data pipelines, tokenization, batch prep, and distributed training at multi-node scale
Build deep observability into training and inference, improving performance, correctness, and efficiency
Debug and troubleshoot the hardest parts of model training and deployment, including distributed failures, GPU bugs, data inconsistencies, and scaling limits
Work closely with AI Researchers to translate cutting-edge algorithms into working systems
Establish strong ModelOps practices to ensure reproducibility, reliability, and continuous improvement across the full lifecycle of foundation models, from initial experiments to production deployment


Who You Are


Passionate about how models are built, trained, and run, especially large-scale foundation models
Driven by curiosity about model internals, training dynamics, and system-level performance
Excited to work across both training and inference, not just one side of the ML stack
Skilled in Python and ML frameworks like PyTorch or JAX. Familiarity with distributed compute (CUDA, Triton, NCCL, etc.) is a bonus but not required
Constantly learning, whether it’s reading open-source repos, replicating research ideas, or designing your own tools to explore a problem
Hands-on and determined. You like writing code, running experiments, and figuring things out
Motivated to help build sovereign AI capability here in Australia


Why Maincode

We are a small team building some of the most advanced AI systems in Australia. We are creating new foundation models from scratch, not just using what’s already out there.

We operate our own GPU clusters, run large-scale training, and work closely across research and engineering to push the frontier of what’s possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who:


Care about model internals, not just outputs
Build things that work, at scale
Take pride in learning, experimenting, and shipping
Want to help Australia build independent, world-class AI systems


Compensation Range: A$150K - A$180K

Every business is powered by contracts, but managing them can slow companies down and cost millions of dollars. Global innovators like L’Oréal, OpenAI, and Salesforce trust Ironclad to transform contracting into a strategic advantage - accelerating revenue, reducing risk, and driving efficiency. It’s the only platform that manages every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement or a complex NDA.

We’re building the future of intelligent contracting and writing the narrative for how contracts unlock strategic growth. Forrester Wave and Gartner Magic Quadrant have consistently recognized Ironclad as a leader in our category. We’ve also been named one of Fortune’s Great Places to Work six years running, featured on Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work, and recognized by Forbes’ 50 Most Promising AI Companies.

We’re backed by leading investors like Accel, Sequoia, Y Combinator, and BOND. We’d love for you to join us!

About The Role

Ironclad is accelerating its investment in AI to redefine how legal teams manage and understand contracts. As part of this effort, we are hiring an AI Evaluation Engineer to work within our AI Pillar. This role is focused on unlocking insights from our training data, designing feedback loops, and ensuring the continuous improvement of our agentic and ML or LLM-based systems through data-driven evaluation and iteration.

You’ll partner closely with AI Engineers and Product Managers to drive better model quality through systematic analysis, experimentation, and the curation of high-leverage datasets. Your work will directly impact the effectiveness of features like Smart Import, contract understanding, and agentic workflows.

What You'll Be Doing


Analyze training and evaluation datasets to identify distributional gaps, labeling inconsistencies, and long-tail opportunities.
Design and execute labeling campaigns, including development of golden datasets and annotation guidelines.
Build and maintain dashboards that track model accuracy, regression trends, and product-specific KPIs like success rate or answer helpfulness.
Investigate failure modes via prompt clustering, error taxonomy development, and user intent classification.
Operationalize feedback loops: mine product telemetry and human-in-the-loop reviews for signal, then translate into data-driven model improvement strategies.
Partner with engineers and PMs to run structured A/B tests and human evaluations for new models or features.
Support the development of scalable data and evaluation infrastructure for LLMs and agents.
Work with product, engineering and legal to create clear & transparent processes for the handling of customer data in AI training, fine-tuning and evaluation


About You


Bachelor's or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science, Applied Math).
1–3 years of experience in applied ML or data science, preferably in NLP or LLM-based applications.
Strong SQL and Python skills; experience with Jupyter, Pandas, and experiment tracking tools.
Comfortable navigating ambiguity, slicing large datasets, and communicating insights clearly to cross-functional stakeholders.
Experience with prompt analysis, clustering, or user behavior modeling is a plus.
Bonus: familiarity with LLM eval techniques, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or agentic system design.Experience with program management.


Why This Role Matters

AI is critical to the value Ironclad customers get from their contracts, allowing their business to manage risk, close revenue faster and operate more effectively. None of this is possible without reliable and accurate data. This role will lead these efforts, becoming a key contributor to the development of AI solutions in an industry that is likely to be transformed by the new generation of models.

What We Value


Bias for action and data curiosity
Ownership mindset and team-first attitude
Comfort in fast-paced, iterative environments
Passion for building AI products that solve real-world customer problems


Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As an early member of our T&S Data Science and Analytics team, you will play an instrumental role in our company’s mission of building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence by building and scaling a data driven culture from the ground up. In this unique company, technology, and moment in history, your work will be critical to informing our product and commercial strategy as we deploy safe, frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with product, engineering, policy & enforcement to define and measure key company success metrics, analyze user behavior to identify new enforcement opportunities and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You’ve worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into user behavior data to provide insights on safety concerns
Define core metrics that measure the team's success. Set goals, build forecasts, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting
Identify and size opportunities to improve the product, influencing product roadmap through your insights and recommendations
Develop hypotheses on product changes, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics
Build a data driven culture from the ground up by establishing foundational data best practices and making data more accessible across the company


You May Be a Good Fit If You


8+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in an infrastructure or operations context.
5+ years of experience deeply embedding in Product teams
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI.
Expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective.
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress.
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions.
Experience in turning open questions and data into concise and insightful analysis.
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills.


Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$230,000 - $275,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong>How We're Different<br><br></strong>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.<br><br>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.<br><br><strong>Come work with us!<br><br></strong>Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

About You


You’re a fully-licensed Professional Counselor at a Master’s level or above with LPC, LPCC, LCPC, LCPCS, LPCC-S licensure (accepted on a state by state basis), a valid NPI number, and malpractice insurance.
You’re ready to launch a private practice, or grow your existing business by taking insurance.

Field Engineering Inspector II: $6,585 - $8,825 per month

If you want to join a hardworking team that shares a commitment to provide top-quality municipal services in a prime North County location, consider a career with the City of Escondido. We have an opening for the position of Utilities Construction Coordinator in our Development Services Department/Engineering Division. For a complete listing of job duties and qualifications, please refer to the corresponding job description, which can be obtained from the Human Resources Department or downloaded from the City's website.

Under general supervision (Field Engineering Inspector I), or direction (Field Engineering Inspector II), inspects construction of all types of public works projects (both public and private funded improvements), including, but not limited to, grading, street improvements, storm drains, underground utility systems and irrigation systems.

DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS

Field Engineering Inspector I – This is the entry level class in the Field Engineering Inspector series. Positions in the class perform more routine inspections as incumbents develop inspection techniques, procedures, and record keeping practices. This level is not expected to function with the same amount of work knowledge, skill level, or discretion and judgment as positions allocated to the Field Engineering Inspector II level. Incumbents work under immediate supervision while learning work methods, progressing to general supervision as job duties and responsibilities are learned and satisfactorily demonstrated. Incumbents initially appointed to Field Engineering Inspector I level may progress to Field Engineering Inspector II after successfully completing one year (12 months) as a Field Engineering Inspector I with the City of Escondido, and achieving the qualifications and division requirements established for progression.

Field Engineering Inspector II – This is the journey level class in the Field Engineering Inspector series. Incumbents at this level must demonstrate the ability to independently perform advanced field engineering inspections. Positions in this class series are flexibly staffed and the Field Engineering Inspector II level is normally filled by advancement from the Field Engineering Inspector I level. One year of experience comparable to a Field Engineering Inspector I with the City of Escondido is required, or three years of experience performing inspections of major municipal public works projects.

Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We build, power, and evolve the tools and technologies that connect millions of entrepreneurs with millions of buyers around the world. As an Etsy Inc. employee, whether a team member of Etsy or Depop, you will tackle unique, meaningful, and large-scale problems alongside passionate coworkers, all the while making a rewarding impact and Keeping Commerce Human.

Salary Range

$119,000.00 - $155,000.00

What’s the role?

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Marketing Analytics team in Brooklyn! Learning new skills and techniques is not only a requirement but a perk of the job. We are always looking for opportunities to improve. Our mission is to demystify marketing with insights grounded in data, telling the story of how we attract and retain our users to teams, to senior management, and to the community.

This is a full-time position reporting to the Senior Manager of Analytics. In addition to salary, you will also be eligible for an equity package, an annual performance bonus, and our competitive benefits that support you and your family as part of your total rewards package at Etsy.

This role requires your presence in Etsy’s Brooklyn Office once or twice per week depending on your proximity to the office. Candidates living within commutable distance of Etsy’s Brooklyn Office Hub may be the first to be considered. Learn more details about our work modes and workplace safety policies here.

What’s this team like at Etsy?

The Marketing Analytics team is responsible for helping drive the success of marketing efforts at Etsy by providing meaningful insights, industry-leading measurement techniques, and access to the metrics, data, and tools needed for decision-making and optimization.

We partner with our peers in marketing, analytics, research, product, engineering, and finance through all stages of development: identifying initial opportunities, refining the user experience, analyzing the impact of our efforts, and highlighting improvement areas. Ultimately, the team’s work strengthens Etsy and helps continuously improve the Etsy experience.

What does the day-to-day look like?


Develop, implement, and refine core marketing measurement frameworks and models, including attribution, churn, CLV, return on investment, experiment methodology, and segmentation.
Drive forward strategy for performance marketing partners by transforming raw data into meaningful and impactful analyses characterized by strong data governance, technique clarity, and clear documentation.
Play a foundational role in deciding how we can best engage and grow Etsy users by determining and helping prioritize opportunities for growth through analysis of behavioral and transactional data.
Identify key metrics that drive the performance of marketing channels and marketing products, make these accessible to partners through dashboards and reports, and drive these metrics through statistical analyses of experiments.
Continually evaluate and refine your technical toolkit, sharing what you learn with the team.
Of course, this is just a sample of the kinds of work this role will require! You should assume that your role will encompass other tasks, too, and that your job duties and responsibilities may change from time to time at Etsy's discretion, or otherwise applicable with local law.


Qualities that will help you thrive in this role are:


2+ years of proven experience as a data scientist/analyst or in a quantitative role in which you extracted meaning from big data sets with little engineering support.
Experience with performance/digital marketing operations, channel attribution, churn and lifetime value models, analytical tools and infrastructure, and finding efficient growth strategies a plus.
Experience working with Creators or on Creator marketing is a plus.
Proficient in SQL and either R or Python.
Proven ability to communicate your insights verbally, visually, and in writing with teammates and business partners.
Comfortable guiding others, recommending tools and standard methodologies to improve the efficiency of the teams work.
Strong, independent, analytical problem solver who enjoys thinking about and solving complex and nuanced problems.
Passionate about subjects such as experimental design, data visualization, and statistical analysis techniques.
Experience with Looker, Tableau, or other data visualization software a plus.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

You will build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for critical decision-making, along with self-service tools that empower business partners
You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing marketing outreach strategies or building a marketing forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for Marketing analytics


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Marketing and GTM
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy


Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Marketing, Sales, and other GTM teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)

We are looking for our first Data Scientist to lead data science efforts across autonomy, safety, and product. As the lead you will help set the foundation for how data science is done at Bedrock, you'll deliver the most critical insights across many domains, and you'll define the future growth of the team.

We're looking for a data scientist who is adept at working with infrastructure and data engineering teams, has experience with complex data similar to autonomy, robotics, or complex ad-tech use cases. We're also looking for someone who has experience in fast growing companies and startups.

If you think this describes you, in whole or in part, we'd love to talk to you about joining us to be our first data scientist.

Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

We’re generating chemical data purpose-built to propel drug discovery into the information age — and we’re doing it on a larger scale and faster than has ever before been possible.

Our closed loop system generates precise chemical datasets at unrivaled scale that work seamlessly with AI to systematically map biochemical interactions between small molecules and causes of disease. Iterative cycles of virtual molecular design and experimentation power AI and machine learning models, which in turn guide the next cycle of design. With a chemistry engine that measures billions of interactions daily and becomes increasingly precise with every cycle, we can answer an unprecedented array of questions — deriving insights that enable us to predictably create drugs for patients in need.

Position Summary: Terray is currently seeking a motivated, creative, and experienced machine learning engineer. As an integral member of our Computational and Data Sciences (CDS) team, the candidate will be responsible for developing and deploying state-of-the-art machine learning models trained on up to billions of small molecule affinity/activity data points in order to accelerate drug discovery efforts internally and for our partners. Researchers in this position have a unique opportunity to test models with very high certainty, and build precise models facilitated by a scale of data unavailable elsewhere.

The Core Responsibilities Of This Position Are


Develop and train transformer-based models on novel, large, multimodal datasets.
Write modules in a pytorch codebase to encode and decode new chemical and drug data modalities.
Light curation of datasets.
Statistical analysis of model performance.
Deploy models as components to our existing inference and design tools.
Communicate and Coordinate your experiments with the rest of the Machine Learning Team.


Experience and Qualifications: Part of Terray’s success is nurtured by a hands-on work environment where everyone is accountable, vested in a vision of excellence, and actively taking part in the success of the business. Terray supports a positive work environment where employees can feel engaged, recognized and empowered to be creative.

Required Qualifications


Fluent in PyTorch and/or JAX
Experience authoring high performance modules for expressive encoders/decoders and/or generators of structured data manifolds
Comfortable manipulating data and models in a heterogeneous, multi-cloud, decentralized infrastructure (sql, no-sql, docker, redis, aws, dgx)
Experience with distributed model training
Familiarity with molecular data manifolds is a plus
Willingness to demonstrate mastery of ML in a short (< 6 hr) at-home exercise, or with a preponderance of visible work

Compensation Details: $140,000 - $216,000 (annually) depending on seniority; participation in the Company's option plan; 3% retirement safe harbor contribution; fully-paid medical, dental, vision, life and disability benefits.

APPLICATION FILING AND UPDATE BULLETIN LANGUAGE.

Exam Number

PH1763B

Type Of Recruitment

We welcome applications from anyone.

First Day Of Filing

The application filing period will begin on Monday, March 3, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time (PT) – Continuous.

We will keep accepting applications until the position is filled. The application window may close unexpectedly once we have enough qualified candidates.

Definition

No out-of-class experience will be accepted.

Under general supervision, develops and applies methods to identify, collect, process, organize, and analyze structured and unstructured data using statistical prediction, inference, and optimization; effectively communicates results to County, departmental, and divisional decision makers to support data-driven program design and management.

Classification Standards

This is the second working level in the professional data science/analysis series. Positions allocable to this class work under the general direction of a Data Science Supervisor or supervisor or manager responsible for the data analytics, research, or statistical function of a department, independently performing duties of considerable difficulty to complete moderately complex projects or major aspects of large/complex projects that may be divisional, departmental, or Countywide in scope. Incumbents deploy techniques such as data extraction, transformation, and loading; classical statistical analysis and machine learning, including predictive and prescriptive modeling and optimization; and data visualization, to generate critical information and knowledge and effectively communicate findings to technical and nontechnical stakeholders to support data-driven program design, management, and decision-making. Incumbents work with data sets characterized by large volume, moderate complexity, and significant heterogeneity, integrating data from various sources, requiring direct collaboration with data engineers and other IT staff to design and provide feedback on data systems and processes necessary to support their work.

Data Scientist is distinguished from the Senior Data Scientist in that the latter applies subject-matter expertise to identify new and emerging business problems, whereas the Data Scientist works under general supervision to develop methods of interrogating data in order to solve previously identified business problems. The Data Scientist is distinguished from the Predictive Data Analyst in that the latter applies well-established analytic principles, methods, and procedures within existing data systems and architectures to complete well-defined, routine to moderately difficult functions and projects, whereas Data Scientists may develop or assist in developing new analytic methods, functions, and data architectures as necessary to complete complex projects, including those involving unstructured data.

Positions in this class differ from those that plan, design, conduct and evaluate research projects involving complex experimental designs and data analysis, programming and processing of data, and preparing reports and recommendations based on research findings, in that these classes do not employ machine learning or big data as part of their analyses.

Ce qui vous attend.

Vous suivez une formation rémunérée de chef·fe circulation des trains de 14 mois à temps partiel. Après avoir réussi l'examen final, vous contribuez activement depuis le centre d'exploitation de Renens à ce que 9000 trains de voyageurs et 2000 trains de marchandises arrivent chaque jour à destination à l'heure et en toute sécurité. Votre équilibre entre vie professionnelle et vie privée nous tient à cœur dès la formation. C'est pourquoi vous êtes libre de choisir vos journées de pratique à 60% pour votre temps de formation et ainsi de planifier les jours restants bien à l'avance afin de préserver votre équilibre. Suite à votre formation de 14 mois à Renens, vous serez détaché·e pour une durée de 12 à 24 mois dans une gare en Suisse Romande. Après cette période, votre lieu de travail sera le nouveau centre d'exploitation à Renens. Vous considérez les horaires irréguliers et le travail par équipe comme un avantage pour profiter de votre temps libre pendant que d'autres travaillent. Chez nous, travailler la nuit et le week-end donne droit à une rémunération supplémentaire, p. ex. CHF 16.– de l'heure pour le travail du dimanche. Des majorations de temps de 10 à 30% sont accordées au titre du travail de nuit, ce qui vous donne plus de temps libre.

Ce que vous pouvez faire bouger.

Vous justifiez d'un apprentissage de trois ans ou d'une maturité achevés avec succès.
Vous possédez une compréhension tant orale qu'écrite de la langue du lieu de travail et avez des connaissances en allemand. Un certificat niveau A2 d'allemand vous sera demandé dans les deux ans après votre engagement.
Vous possédez un sens de la couleur sans défaut (pas de daltonisme).
Lors du processus de sélection, un extrait du casier judiciaire datant de moins de 3 mois vous sera demandé. Ce document peut être fourni après la sélection de votre dossier de candidature pour un interview.

Le classement durant la seconde formation s'effectue selon la fonction et l'âge. Vous trouverez plus d'informations sur le salaire concret pour ce rôle sous Reconversion professionnelle.

Benefits

Kenai Therapeutics is advancing off-the-shelf dopamine neuron replacement therapies as a disease-modifying and potentially curative treatment for neurological disorders. Our next-generation, gene-modified iPSC platform leverages a novel approach to treating central nervous system conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, by replacing neurons that are lost due to degenerative neurologic disorders and delivering therapeutic proteins. RNDP-001, our lead cell therapy candidate, is an iPSC-derived dopamine progenitor for the treatment of both idiopathic and inherited forms of Parkinson's disease, and has displayed superior survival, innervation, and behavioral rescue in preclinical models of Parkinson's diseases. Kenai also has two additional gene-modified programs in discovery phase for the treatment of mild to severe rapid progressing Parkinson's disease and young onset Parkinson's disease.

Kenai currently occupies state-of-the-art labs in San Diego and is hiring new members for that team. This is an excellent opportunity for a talented, highly motivated individual to make significant contributions to the development of next-generation therapies to treat devastating neurological disorders.

How To Apply

Interested candidates are invited to submit their resume and cover letter to [tcordie@kenaitx.com] with the subject line ""Process Development Specialist Application - [Your Name].""

Kenai Therapeutics is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Onze expertise maakt ons uniek!

Wij zorgen ervoor dat GenAI en Advanced Analytics modellen in productie kunnen draaien, beheerd en geïnnoveerd worden. Dit is noodzakelijk om de potentie van deze modellen om te zetten in daadwerkelijke waarde.

In een team van (4) machine learning engineers werk je nauw samen met onze data scientists om de modellen die zij ontwikkelen in productie te zetten. Binnen hypotheken zijn jullie de enige die dat betrouwbaar en compliant kunnen doen. Het team werkt DevOps en is dus ook verantwoordelijk voor het beheer van de modellen en innovatie van de technologie. Zo zijn we momenteel bezig om een nieuw GenAI platform, specifiek voor ABN AMRO Hypotheken, op te zetten.

Je werk

ABN AMRO zet stevig in op GenAI en andere machine learning modellen. Om deze verantwoord en gecontroleerd in productie te zetten hebben we jou nodig. Deze modellen draaien in een databricks omgeving. Daarnaast breiden we uit met een AzureML omgeving voor onze genAI usecases. (Ruime) ervaring met Azure, databricks en Python / PySpark kennis is dan ook noodzakelijk. Werkervaring met Agile / Scrum is een pre.

Naast technische vaardigheden is de juiste mindset belangrijk. Je voelt eigenaarschap over de modellen die het team onder zijn hoede heeft. Je zoekt de samenwerking op met onze data scientists om hun behoefte te begrijpen en ze te kunnen helpen. Daarbij raak je niet je eigen vakmanschap uit het oog en geef je tegengas als de oplossing niet aan onze interne (en mogelijk externe) richtlijnen voldoet. Je hebt kwaliteit hoog in het vaandel staan.

Werkomgeving

Ons kantoor is gevestigd in Amersfoort en de sfeer op onze afdeling is gezellig en ontspannen. Passie voor je vak, ondernemerschap en vakmanschap vinden wij belangrijk op de afdeling. De cultuur is informeel, wij zijn open naar elkaar en vieren successen. We hechten veel waarde aan goede communicatie en afstemming binnen de teams en afdeling. Experimenteren wordt aangemoedigd en fouten maken mag, zolang je ervan leert en ze kunt verantwoorden. Op maandag zitten we met heel ICT op kantoor voor teammeetings en andere samenwerkingsvormen. Daarnaast hebben veel teams nog een extra dag waarin zij samenkomen.

This is a remote-first, contract-based role, open to top-tier talent anywhere in the world, with optional travel to Degas’ HQ in Tokyo, investor locations, and regional field operations in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.

About Degas

Degas’ mission is “Changing people’s lives, dramatically.” We are an innovative AI technology company focused on developing scalable, AI-driven global products that address the world’s greatest challenges. Alongside our most advanced tech products, we also operate deeply rooted field initiatives that increase the income of smallholder farmers in Africa and beyond — combining expertise in data aggregation, AI credit scoring, satellite observations, financing, and carbon markets.

As part of our next strategic evolution, Degas is launching a new global business division that integrates proprietary agricultural yield intelligence with capital markets — starting with soft commodity trading. This marks a bold new chapter in how we scale impact and create financial value from our AI-driven insights.

About The Role

Degas FM is seeking a Geospatial Data Scientist to refine cocoa-specific agro-yield prediction models and transform them into structured, backtested trade signals. The successful candidate will work with NDVI, rainfall, and disease stress layers, using Degas FM’s satellite-derived data to calibrate anomaly detection and build signal triggers linked to cocoa futures market behavior.

This role is ideal for a specialist at the intersection of remote sensing, ag forecasting, and trading signal engineering. Your work will directly enable the firm’s internal arbitrage strategy by turning environmental data into quantitative insights actionable in ICE markets.

Key Responsibilities


Signal Development & Engineering: Convert NDVI trends, rainfall deviation, and crop stress indicators into structured yield anomaly signals. Develop automated signal pipelines including: preprocessing of satellite and geospatial data, regional anomaly scoring, threshold-based triggers for trading entry/exit, and signal output formatting for the trading desk.
Model Calibration & Backtesting: Align signals with historical cocoa price movements using time-series correlation, lag analysis, and seasonality. Maintain and refine a lightweight backtesting module to evaluate model accuracy, false positives, and market sensitivity. Define signal precision metrics (e.g., hit rate, average return per signal) and improve them iteratively.
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with the cocoa trader, Degas FM data team, and field intelligence teams to align model assumptions with on-the-ground realities. Integrate regional knowledge (e.g., harvest windows, rainfall anomalies, or disease outbreaks) into signal refinement cycles.
Signal Monitoring & Maintenance: Ensure consistent pipeline performance, data freshness, and signal integrity over time. Implement automated alerts for model drift, data anomalies, or invalid triggers. Maintain a minimum viable monitoring dashboard or reporting interface.
Knowledge Sharing & Documentation: Document signal methodologies, assumptions, and known limitations in a clear, accessible format. Share insights regularly with non-technical stakeholders to support broader organizational understanding of yield-to-price dynamics.


Essential Qualifications & Experience


3+ years of experience in geospatial or satellite-based agro-intelligence modeling (e.g., NDVI, precipitation, disease spread).
Strong Python skills: pandas, NumPy, xarray, and time-series analysis libraries.
Proven ability to build forecasting models and signal classification tools for crop yield anomalies.
Familiarity with cocoa or other tropical perennial crops is a strong plus.
Prior collaboration with quant traders or basic understanding of commodity markets is highly desirable.


Desired Attributes


Accuracy- and outcome-oriented; thrives on impact more than documentation.
Able to work independently and iterate quickly with minimal supervision.
Comfortable with ambiguity, lagged data, and low-process environments.
Cross-functional communicator: can translate statistical insights into strategic recommendations.
Values transparency, scientific rigor, and collaboration.


Encouragement to Apply

Even if some of the qualifications mentioned above don't align perfectly with your experience, we still want to hear from you! We encourage you to apply even if you don't meet every single qualification listed.

Compensation

Competitive salary, commensurate with experience and qualifications.

Comprehensive benefits package.

Why Degas?

Degas is committed to the mission of ""Changing people’s lives, dramatically"" as an impact-oriented, for-profit startup. Degas has achieved 2x year-over-year revenue growth for the past three years and has established a profitable farmer financing business. In 2023 alone, we doubled the incomes of over 26,000 smallholder farmers in Africa, as verified by a third-party assessment.

We leverage both advanced and 'primitive' technologies, from GPUs for state-of-the-art foundation models to offline-enabled mobile apps for data aggregation in rural areas of developing countries.

We prioritize long-term thinking, investing in technology, operations, and people to change the world in ways no one has ever done before.

At Grimmwyrd, we’re on a mission to reinvent interactive storytelling. We are building an on-device narrative engine for games and training simulations called Loreweaver. A digital game master that delivers unlimited inference for long-scope storybuilding on consumer-level hardware. We champion curiosity, collaboration and practicality.




The Role

We’re looking for an MSc to dive into any part of our LLM systems stack. You can decide yourself whether you focus on memory retrieval, speculative decoding, safety evaluation, multimodal perception, edge-optimized deployment, foundational model frameworks, fine-tuning, long-term memory, narrative arc modelling, graphics programming, or something else. You’ll pick a project that matches your interests and study requirements, and our needs, drive it from concept through prototype to production-quality code or research write-up, and help power the first truly offline, limitless narrative engine.




Tasks and Responsibilities

Project Ownership: define your scope, survey the latest literature, and propose a roadmap.
Prototyping & Benchmarking: build and iterate on your subsystem using live game data; measure against clear success metrics.
Engineering & Deployment: write clean, well-tested code (Python, TypeScript, or WGSL) and integrate into our repo.
Collaboration: participate in design reviews, pair-programming sessions, and team demos.
Communication: document your work in a final report, prepare a technical blog post or conference submission.




Profile

If you have never done any hobby programming outside of school projects you need not apply
Enrolled in a WO-level Computer Science or related MSc program
Strong programming skills in Python and/or TypeScript
Familiarity with at least one: graph databases (e.g., Neo4j), vector embeddings, async LLM serving (e.g., vLLM), GPU programming (WebGPU/WASM), quantisation methods (e.g., AWQ), or custom fine-tuning methods (Narrative Arc Modelling, etc.)
Curiosity for deep research and ability to translate papers into working prototypes
Available full-time or part-time for 5–6 months




What We Offer You

Mentorship: weekly 1:1s with senior architects (Torrance, John, or Ben) for guidance on research, design, and code reviews
Real impact: your code and findings will ship in our engine and may feature in publications or workshop demos
Cutting-Edge research: Opportunities to co-author papers or blog posts
Renumeration + potential job & stock options: We offer a monthly allowance of €200, along with the opportunity for full‐time employment upon successful completion of your internship and eligibility for stock options.




Interested?

Send your CV and a brief motivation (max 250 words) to rijk@grimmwyrdstudios.com with “AI Internship Application” in the subject line so that I know you’ve actually read the internship descirption.

Benefits

Kenai Therapeutics is advancing off-the-shelf dopamine neuron replacement therapies as a disease-modifying and potentially curative treatment for neurological disorders. Our next-generation, gene-modified iPSC platform leverages a novel approach to treating central nervous system conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, by replacing neurons that are lost due to degenerative neurologic disorders and delivering therapeutic proteins. RNDP-001, our lead cell therapy candidate, is an iPSC-derived dopamine progenitor for the treatment of both idiopathic and inherited forms of Parkinson's disease, and has displayed superior survival, innervation, and behavioral rescue in preclinical models of Parkinson's diseases. Kenai also has two additional gene-modified programs in discovery phase for the treatment of mild to severe rapid progressing Parkinson's disease and young onset Parkinson's disease.

Kenai currently occupies state-of-the-art labs in San Diego and is hiring new members for that team. This is an excellent opportunity for a talented, highly motivated individual to make significant contributions to the development of next-generation therapies to treat devastating neurological disorders.

How To Apply

Interested candidates are invited to submit their resume and cover letter to [tcordie@kenaitx.com] with the subject line ""Process Development Specialist Application - [Your Name].""

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

How You Will Make An Impact


Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency


Preferred Experience


Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python


Who You Are


You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence

We are a mission-driven organization that was born out of the health care research at Harvard Business School led by Michael Porter and Bob Kaplan. We provide health systems, surgery centers, and physicians with comprehensive insight into their surgical care through our software and empower them to improve their finances and deliver the best care possible to their patients. We integrate sophisticated analytics with deep industry knowledge. We are thought leaders and our impactful work in improving health care efficiency and effectiveness has been recognized and featured in publications like the Harvard Business Review and The Wall Street Journal. We are well capitalized and backed by leading VCs, including General Catalyst, Founder Collective, Fulcrum Equity Partners and Tectonic Ventures. Join us in our mission to reshape health care through innovation and insight.




Position Overview




We are hiring an AI/LLM Engineer to help transform how hospital stakeholders interact with data -- using natural language, intelligent agents, and generative AI capabilities. You’ll join a small, fast-moving team working on cutting-edge language model applications directly integrated into our flagship analytics platform, CareMeasurement.




This is a new, hands-on role where you’ll be empowered to ship features with real-world impact. You'll collaborate closely with the product team to extend our current LLM-based chat functionality, build agentic workflows (e.g. data-driven recommendations, email/presentation generation), and explore the frontier of ""why"" question answering in healthcare analytics.




Key Responsibilities




Design, prototype, and productionize AI-powered features using LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Extend our natural language interface to support more complex queries and agentic tasks (e.g. summarizing cost savings opportunities, generating reports or presentations, notifying users).
Build orchestration layers around OpenAI’s APIs and internal data pipelines for reliable and explainable AI responses.
Collaborate cross-functionally with product managers, clinical experts, and backend engineers to deliver seamless, user-focused AI experiences.
Monitor and evaluate model performance and user feedback to guide iteration.
Stay current with LLM and AI trends, and propose pragmatic applications within our domain.




Qualifications




Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years of experience building backend or data-intensive applications, preferably in a SaaS environment.
1+ years working directly with frontier language models (e.g. OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic), including prompt engineering and API orchestration.
Strong Python skills and experience building production-grade features or services.
Familiarity with vector databases and RAG patterns (e.g. Postgres/pgvector or similar).




Bonus Skills




Experience with Django, MySQL, and AWS.
Familiarity with healthcare data or HIPAA-compliant systems.

＜入社後、まずは・・・＞

4ヶ月の研修を経て店長に！

その後、調理・接客・スタッフの教育やシフト作成

品質管理・衛生管理・地域のお客様に喜ばれる企画の立案＆実行などを、スタッフと協力して行います。

＜研修について＞

▼2日間／本社にて集合研修

まずは企業理解を深めて頂くために、座学にて経営理念や社内規定を学んで頂きます。

▼2ヶ月間／各研修センターにて基礎研修

すぐに店舗デビュー！ではなく、安心してしっかりと基本を身に着けて頂きます。

▼2ヶ月間／各エリアの教育指定店舗での実地研修

店舗にて2か月研修後実際の営業を通じて更なるスキルUPを感じられます！

その後店長業務を経験した先には、新店の立上げや複数店舗管理など経験業務の幅を広げ、複数店舗を管轄するマネージャーを目指すことができます！

＜おすすめポイント＞

◎「こだわり」を忘れない

店舗ごとの「こだわり」を感じて頂き、人でしか提供できない「ぬくもり」を思い出させてくれるそんな場所を増やしていきたいと考えています。

あなたの”お客様を想うアイデア”を活かして一緒に愛される店舗を作っていきましょう。

◎評価の8割がお客様満足！

売上よりも”お客様に喜んで頂くこと”を第一に考えています。

そのため、店長の評価も【売上/利益2割、お客様満足8割】

お客様を想う行動が、評価される環境でお客様に本気で向き合える環境があります。

◎店長ってとにかく忙しくてプライベートの時間が確保できないのでは？

飲食店の店長はそんなイメージがあると思いますが当社は違います。

当社では、店長本来の業務に集中できる環境があります。

報告業務のシステム化やオペレーションの改良を続け、

ただホールキッチン業務をこなすのではなく「あなたにしかできない店舗づくり」に向き合えるように体制を整えています。

＜キャリアについて＞

国内1100店舗を目指している当社。

マネージャーやチーフマネージャー、営業部長など、今後も成長していく当社だからこそ、キャリアアップの可能性に根拠があります！

1年目から新店立上げの店長として新しいことに挑戦したり、

2年目でマネージャーになった人、3年目でチーフマネージャーに抜擢された人もいます。

教育研修、商品開発、海外部門など他部門で活躍している先輩もいます。

半期ごとにキャリアの方向性や希望を上司に相談できるキャリア面談などの実施があるため、

目指したい方向を見定めながら、その人に合ったキャリアアップを目指せます。

＜当社について＞

カフェ・うどん・ラーメン・炭火焼鳥など、多ジャンルを全国に展開中。

エリアマネージャー、チーフマネージャーなど、多彩なキャリアアップを用意しています。

ご自身の意欲と頑張り次第で様々な事に挑戦できるチャンスがある会社です！

自分のアイデアを活かして店舗づくりをしたい方、お客様を想う行動が評価される環境で働きたい方、

チームで協力して1つのことを成し遂げたい方、お客様の”笑顔”の為に努力できる方など 大歓迎です！

＜入社後、まずは・・・＞

4ヶ月の研修を経て店長に！

その後、調理・接客・スタッフの教育やシフト作成

品質管理・衛生管理・地域のお客様に喜ばれる企画の立案＆実行などを、スタッフと協力して行います。

＜研修について＞

▼2日間／本社にて集合研修

まずは企業理解を深めて頂くために、座学にて経営理念や社内規定を学んで頂きます。

▼2ヶ月間／各研修センターにて基礎研修

すぐに店舗デビュー！ではなく、安心してしっかりと基本を身に着けて頂きます。

▼2ヶ月間／各エリアの教育指定店舗での実地研修

店舗にて2か月研修後実際の営業を通じて更なるスキルUPを感じられます！

その後店長業務を経験した先には、新店の立上げや複数店舗管理など経験業務の幅を広げ、複数店舗を管轄するマネージャーを目指すことができます！

＜おすすめポイント＞

◎「こだわり」を忘れない

店舗ごとの「こだわり」を感じて頂き、人でしか提供できない「ぬくもり」を思い出させてくれるそんな場所を増やしていきたいと考えています。

あなたの”お客様を想うアイデア”を活かして一緒に愛される店舗を作っていきましょう。

◎評価の8割がお客様満足！

売上よりも”お客様に喜んで頂くこと”を第一に考えています。

そのため、店長の評価も【売上/利益2割、お客様満足8割】

お客様を想う行動が、評価される環境でお客様に本気で向き合える環境があります。

◎店長ってとにかく忙しくてプライベートの時間が確保できないのでは？

飲食店の店長はそんなイメージがあると思いますが当社は違います。

当社では、店長本来の業務に集中できる環境があります。

報告業務のシステム化やオペレーションの改良を続け、

ただホールキッチン業務をこなすのではなく「あなたにしかできない店舗づくり」に向き合えるように体制を整えています。

＜キャリアについて＞

国内1100店舗を目指している当社。

マネージャーやチーフマネージャー、営業部長など、今後も成長していく当社だからこそ、キャリアアップの可能性に根拠があります！

1年目から新店立上げの店長として新しいことに挑戦したり、

2年目でマネージャーになった人、3年目でチーフマネージャーに抜擢された人もいます。

教育研修、商品開発、海外部門など他部門で活躍している先輩もいます。

半期ごとにキャリアの方向性や希望を上司に相談できるキャリア面談などの実施があるため、

目指したい方向を見定めながら、その人に合ったキャリアアップを目指せます。

＜当社について＞

カフェ・うどん・ラーメン・炭火焼鳥など、多ジャンルを全国に展開中。

エリアマネージャー、チーフマネージャーなど、多彩なキャリアアップを用意しています。

ご自身の意欲と頑張り次第で様々な事に挑戦できるチャンスがある会社です！

自分のアイデアを活かして店舗づくりをしたい方、お客様を想う行動が評価される環境で働きたい方、

★「重度訪問介護サービス」とは？

【フリー本文(２)】

介護と聞くと、高齢者介護や施設介護を思い浮かべる方が多いかもしれません。

当社の主力事業の重度訪問介護サービスとは、重度の障がいをお持ちの方のご自宅で生活を支援するサービスです。

障害をお持ちの方の中には、医療的ケア（気管切開による喀痰吸引や胃ろう等を用いた経管栄養等）が欠かせない方もいらっしゃいますが、特徴的なのは「見守り」という支援スタイル。長時間連続での利用が想定されており、身体介助や家事など動的なサポートを行います。

さらに、ご利用者さまと一緒にテレビを見たり、会話を楽しむなど、一般的にイメージされる介護とは少し異なるため、介護への価値観の変化や新しい働き方の発見になると思います！

【フリー見出し(３)】

★キャリア支援の仕組みをご紹介

豊富な選択肢があるからこそ、未来の自分のワクワクできる

【本文】

異業種から転職し、半年でコーディネーター、1年ほどでオフィスマネージャーになった社員の方に話を聞きました。

「当社の多彩なキャリアステップは魅力だと思います。現場スタッフから短期間でリーダー職や本部の管理職になる事も珍しくなく、子会社の取締役になった方もいて、多種多様なキャリアを選択できる環境です。“今できている、できていない”が分かりやすい『自己評価システム』があるからこそ、評価を意識した働き方で、早い段階でポジションを上げることができます。

また役職に応じて月給や手当も増えるため、『安定した未来を歩みたい』だけでなく、『稼ぎたい！』方も満足度高く働いていただけると思います」

【やりがい】

【人生に深く寄り添える】

1日1件の訪問体制により、目の前の利用者さまにしっかりと向き合えます。利用者さまやご家族と信頼を築き、日々の生活に密着して必要とされるやりがいを実感できるのが醍醐味です。生活が改善されたなど、直接的に感謝や喜びの声をいただける瞬間も多いです。

また、最短半年でコーディネーター、1年でマネージャーへのキャリアアップが可能なため、役職手当でさらなる収入アップも目指せます。

【きびしさ】

【粘り強いサポート】

利用者さまとの1対1のお仕事が基本となるため、一人ひとりにあった柔軟な対応が求められます。時には意思の疎通がうまくいかないなど、難しく感じる局面があるかもしれませんが根気よくサポートを続ける姿勢が必要です。

周囲には経験豊富な先輩社員がたくさんいます！実体験からくるさまざまなアドバイスがもらえますので、過度な心配は不要です。
