The system would detect colorimetric images and predict with a high level of accuracy discrete pH values, delivering lab-quality diagnostic precision to women and doctors - anytime, anywhere!


Tasks


To make pHera robust and scalable, pHera is looking for a computer vision and machine learning engineer to design and implement the complete computer-vision pipeline: from image capture, colour detection and pH prediction.





Implement computer vision algorithms for color detection from captured images


Integrate machine learning models for accurate pH prediction based colour detection


Ensure performance across different smartphone devices and lighting conditions





Applicants who clearly outline in thier cover letter how they would implement these three tasks will be prioritised.


Requirements



Based in Berlin


Eager to work in an early-stage, science-driven, female health startup


Comfortable with ambiguity, self-directed, and proactive



Benefits


Flexibility: choose freelance, part-time or full-time




Hybrid work environment with office space in Berlin




A competitive salary for 6 months with the possibility of extension




pHera is closing the gender health gap!

Most existing vaginal pH test strips are analog, low-resolution, visually subjective, and

poorly suited for women’s health applications. Doctors need fast, reliable tools to

help with complicated diagnoses. Women deserve clarity, not guesswork when

managing their vaginal health from home. A high-resolution pH test can catch

imbalances early, making it easier to monitor issues like bacterial vaginosis,

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

You would be joining a flexible and dynamic team and your role will include:


selecting features, building and optimizing classifiers using machine learning techniques
processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
deep dive on the problems using SQL and scripting languages to drive solutions leveraging Statistical Analysis
implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases

Our platform helps teams from fast moving startups to Fortune 500s, automate entire workflows using self-learning agents that adapt in real time. By removing the drag of manual, repetitive work, we free people to focus on what actually needs human thinking. We're reimagining how operations scale, with clarity, speed, and intelligence at the core. To learn more, visit https://beam.ai/.

About The Team

Beam's AI Agent Deployment team sits at the intersection of AI, product, and client impact. We partner closely with customers to understand their workflows, design intelligent automation solutions, and ensure our agents deliver real business value. Our work spans workflow design, agent configuration, technical integration, and ongoing optimization. We collaborate with engineering, ML, and product teams to translate abstract problems into scalable, agentic systems that work in the real world. This is a high-context, high-ownership environment where Deployment engineers operate with autonomy, move fast, and shape both how Beam's platform evolves and how our customers succeed.

About The Role

As a Senior AI Agent Engineer at Beam, you will play a key role in delivering enterprise-grade AI automations tailored to real business processes. You'll work directly with clients to understand their requirements, break down complex workflows, and design prompt-driven agents that solve high-impact problems. You'll also support integration efforts with client systems and ensure smooth delivery from concept to deployment.

We're looking for someone who thrives in a hands-on, fast-moving environment, with a strong technical foundation, programming skills, a process-oriented mindset, and a passion for AI. You should feel confident working with APIs, designing robust automations, and collaborating across teams to turn business needs into working solutions.

Collaborate closely with product, engineering, and solutions teams to scope, define, and implement new features based on real customer needs
Design agentic automations and engineer prompts that are scalable, efficient, and integrate smoothly into customer workflows
Stay up to date with the latest advancements in AI and apply them to solve critical business problems and drive new features that impact the future of Beam's AI platform
Troubleshoot technical issues and provide guidance to both customers and internal teams throughout the implementation process
Act as a strategic technical partner, advising customers on best practices, helping them adopt AI agents, and identifying opportunities for deeper integration
Work with client-side and internal technical teams to scope and manage API-based integrations

Benefits

At Beam, we're building an environment where ambitious people can do their best work, with clarity, purpose, and room to grow. We're thoughtful about what we build, how we work, and who we hire. The problems we're solving are real. The systems we're building are complex. And the people here care deeply, about craft, about speed, and about doing work that actually matters. You won't find rigid hierarchies or endless process here. You'll find high trust, high standards, and a team driven by curiosity, ownership, and long-term thinking.

What You'll Find Here


Ownership with clarity: You'll drive work from idea to execution in a high-context, high-autonomy environment. We trust people to lead and follow through
Growth that compounds: Whether you're deepening your technical expertise, exploring leadership, or learning across disciplines, we support growth paths that aren't one-size-fits-all
Work that matters: You'll contribute to AI-native systems already powering real-world operations, not just prototypes or experiments
Aligned incentives: We offer competitive compensation and meaningful equity, designed for long-term value creation, not just short-term rewards. When Beam wins, you do too
A culture that raises the bar: You'll work with sharp, kind teammates who value directness, curiosity, and momentum. We challenge each other to do better and support each other every step of the way


If this sounds like the kind of work you want to do and the kind of team you want to grow with, we'd love to hear from you!

Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re on a mission to help the hospitality industry double their profitability, reduce their carbon footprint, and create better working environments for their teams.

Our CEO, Conor, founded and scaled Mad Egg - one of the fastest-growing restaurant groups in Ireland. After years of juggling “market-leading” systems, spreadsheets, and paper printouts, he set out to build the solution he wished he had from day one: Nory.

Nory is an all-knowing restaurant management system. It combines real-time data with AI predictive analytics to help restaurants operate with consistency, certainty and profitability. From food prep to forecasting, Nory puts operators in control of their margins.

Now, with demand growing faster than we imagined - and a recent Series A led by Accel - we’re scaling fast. We’ve grown to a team of 50+ across Ireland, the UK and Spain, and we’re just getting started.

We’re now looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join our Data team. This role is ideal for a senior independent doer, someone who has owned the entire ML lifecycle and is ready to ship meaningful, production-grade ML systems from scratch. This is not a research or experimentation role; it's about building systems that work in the real world and move the needle on customer outcomes and business impact.

What you’ll be doing


Own the end-to-end development of machine learning systems, from business problem formulation and algorithm design through to deployment and monitoring in production
Collaborate with product managers and engineers to define KPIs, design data flows, and embed algorithms in product features
Apply best-in-class ML practices with clear problem framing, model evaluation, experimentation, and observability- to deliver real-world impact
Independently lead the development of models across the platform acting as the primary ML owner and act as the primary ML owner; from data access and cleaning to modelling and integration
Work autonomously while contributing to a culture of collaboration, shared learning, and continuous improvement
Actively participate in peer reviews, team rituals, and cross-functional discovery, sharing insight and offering help where needed


What you’ll bring


Background: Undergraduate Degree or higher in STEM, with a significant statistics component
Full Lifecycle Ownership: You’ve taken ML systems from idea through to production in a commercial setting - repeatedly and successfully. You’re confident in owning the process independently, from problem formulation to monitoring impact in production
Technical Proficiency: Strong Python and experience with ML libraries (e.g., Scikitlearn, Pandas, LightGBM), plus working knowledge of cloud infrastructure and data tools (Snowflake, DBT, Omni)
Structured Thinking: You use a clear and repeatable process to approach ML problems, including problem formulation, KPI definition, and experimental design
Rigour & Impact: You apply rigorous statistical and experimental thinking, and can demonstrate how your work has driven measurable business outcomes
Collaboration: You thrive in highly collaborative environments, communicate clearly, and offer help where needed to improve team outcomes
Startup mindset: You thrive in fast-paced environments, move quickly, and take initiative to maintain momentum and resolve issues efficiently. You are comfortable with ambiguity and multitask effectively while delivering real impact


What you’ll get in return:

📈 Equity at our Series A valuation

🌴 35 days of paid leave per year (including bank holidays)

🏥 Comprehensive private health insurance

🍼 Enhanced parental leave and baby loss support

📚 Learning & development culture – €1000 personal annual budget + quarterly book budget

🖥️ €250 home office workspace budget

🎯 Regular team offsites & socials

👏 And much more

How we work

Our vision is to build a better future for the restaurant industry.

One where operators are in control, margins are stronger, and frontline teams can build careers they’re proud of. To get there, we move fast, stay focused, and hold ourselves to a high bar. Our values guide how we work, grow, and win – together.

These are the values we live by:


We serve up impact with a side of profit


We prioritise work that delivers real financial results for our restaurant partners.


We prioritise speed of service


We move fast, unblock quickly, and deliver with urgency.


We act like owners


We own problems, raise the bar, and build better every day.


We win as a crew

Galois tackles the hardest problems in computer science. Our mission is to assure trust in critical systems that protect the privacy and integrity of information in the real world. Core to this is the application of formal analysis techniques that allow systems to be modeled, analyzed, and mathematically proven correct to ensure that a system behaves exactly as we intend under all circumstances.

We are a community of researchers, engineers, and operations people dedicated to creating trustworthiness in critical systems in every functional area of the organization. Our organization is highly collaborative, and we pursue working from first principles, transparency, building deep trust, learning and innovating, and creating space for you to be authentically you. Our unique organizational structure enables us to adapt to the needs of the innovative projects we deliver.

We are employee-owned and aspire to provide employees with a sense of freedom to pursue passions in and out of work — whether it be opportunities to learn, career growth, a sense of community, or whatever else brings you value as a person.

Research Engineers at Galois design and develop advanced technologies for safety- and security-critical systems, networks, and applications. Engineers work in small team settings and must successfully interact with clients, partners, and other employees in a highly cooperative, collaborative, and intellectually challenging environment.

Our research engineers work in small teams and successfully interact with clients, partners, and other employees in a highly collaborative environment. We're looking for people who can invent, learn, think, and inspire.

About This Role

Galois is hiring a Software Engineer/Researcher to join our team! This role will primarily focus on advancing the state of the art in programming language theory research and implementation. Researchers in this role will use their expertise in Formal Methods and Programming Languages to conduct rigorous formal verification of software and systems, ensuring they meet the highest security standards.

Responsibilities

As a Research Engineer, you will have the following responsibilities:


Requirements gathering: engaging the client in a series of discussions, where each iteration refines the needs of the client, and leads to the suggestion of means to meet those needs
Architecture and design: constructing high-level architectural descriptions of software systems, and constructing deeper program designs by fleshing out architecture prototypes. Architectures must be designed with assurance in mind, determining where and how formal methods are to be applied
Implementation: extending design prototypes through to a finished product, with care taken to ensure robustness and ease of use.
Formal verification: use mechanical reasoning tools such as theorem provers and model checkers to demonstrate or analyze desired security and correctness properties of systems
Testing and validation: constructing and regularly conducting system, unit, and regression tests, and conducting semi-formal validation and verification
Technology research and development: conducting speculative research and development of cutting-edge technology, and incorporating that technology in product prototypes.
Technical infrastructure development: developing (designing, implementing, and maintaining) tools to be used within Galois, and developing library code to be shared among projects


Key Qualifications


Education:
A minimum of a Bachelor's degree in computer science or equivalent is required.
An MS or PhD in CS or a related field is desirable but optional
Required Technical Expertise:
A programming languages background and experience with formal methods

You will translate complex data into clear, compelling stories for technical and non-technical audiences to support data-informed decision-making
Data Infrastructure & Collaboration
You’ll collaborate with Product and Engineering teams to define tracking requirements and ensure accurate, consistent data collection
You’ll identify and recommend improvements to data processes that enhance quality, efficiency, and trust in analytics across the organization

You have 2+ years of experience in a data analytics role, ideally within a B2B SaaS or AI-focused startup environment
You hold at least a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Economics, or a related quantitative field
You are highly proficient in SQL and comfortable writing complex queries and working with diverse database structures
You have hands-on experience with Python (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, or Seaborn) or R for data analysis and visualization
You’re familiar with BI tools such as Tableau, Looker, Power BI, or equivalent platforms
You’re familiar with using Excel or Google Sheets for ad hoc analysis and data exploration
You may also bring experience with product analytics platforms (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude), cloud environments (e.g., AWS or GCP), or data warehousing concepts
You know how to break down complex business problems into structured analyses
You are skilled at identifying trends, patterns, and outliers in data to uncover key insights
You can clearly communicate findings—both in writing and verbally—to technical and non-technical stakeholders alike
Nice to have: You’ve worked in a fast-paced, early-stage startup, you bring familiarity with AI/ML concepts, you understand SaaS metrics and enterprise customers



What you'll get


Ownership of projects and strategic priorities regardless of seniority
Strong ties to the executive team, a culture of transparency and engagement with strategic decisions

This PE-backed platform delivers inspection, maintenance, and installation services across fire and life safety systems, with a primary focus on the marine sector—serving commercial vessels, private yachts, cruise lines, and military ships. With operations in Oakland, Fort Lauderdale, and Los Angeles, the business is actively transitioning from marine dominance to expanding into commercial and industrial real estate fire safety services. The company has completed three acquisitions since September 2024, with ambitions to build a national platform through both M&A and organic growth.

The platform currently generates $20M in revenue with $3.3M in YTD EBITDA and a goal to reach $5M EBITDA by year-end. The long-term vision is to scale to $15–$20M EBITDA and achieve a strategic or sponsor-backed exit.




THE PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM

The firm is a first-time fund with $100M AUM, pursuing control buyouts and aggressive buy-and-build strategies across Industrials, Business Services, and Healthcare. Their investment thesis centers on professionalizing founder-led businesses and scaling platforms through focused M&A and operational improvement. The firm is hands-on early in the hold and highly supportive in execution. They invest in people, not just assets.

Other portfolio businesses include HVAC services and fire safety platforms. The team is based in Los Angeles and is deeply involved in strategy and execution—stepping in when needed and stepping back once teams are built.




THE CULTURE

The platform is in the early stages of cultural transformation. Historically founder-led and location-centric, the business is moving from a fractured C-grade culture toward a cohesive, mission-driven environment. Pride exists at the field level, particularly in marine services, but there is a strong need for leadership to instill structure, values, and accountability.

The CEO will be instrumental in driving this cultural shift—developing leadership, building an outbound sales motion, professionalizing service delivery, and establishing core business functions such as HR and strategic operations.




VISION

What does success look like in this role?

Reach $5M EBITDA by year-end and $15–$20M within 3 years.
Execute a quarterly cadence of acquisitions with seamless integration.
Build and lead a high-performance team—VP Sales, Ops Lead, VP M&A, HR Lead.
Drive cultural transformation across three locations.
Migrate from marine-dominant to diversified fire & life safety platform.
Position the company for a strategic or sponsor-led exit.




THE ROLE

The CEO will be responsible for:

Leading all aspects of the platform—strategy, operations, financial performance, and culture.
Building and leading a team capable of scaling to $20M EBITDA.
Executing and integrating add-on acquisitions in coordination with Walk-On Capital.
Driving organic growth initiatives including outbound sales and commercial expansion.
Professionalizing all business functions: HR, service delivery, finance, and operations.
Representing the platform to the board and investors.




KEY SELLING POINTS OF THE ROLE

Lead a growing platform in a $68.5Bn+ market with strong M&A momentum.
Opportunity to build and own the story of a sponsor-backed roll-up.
High equity upside—aligned directly with the sponsor's contribution.
Supportive and execution-driven board with track record of value creation.
Be the face of a future $20M EBITDA exit with strategic and sponsor interest already validated.




KEY CHALLENGES FOR THE ROLE

First-time PE-backed business—requires pace, structure, and vision.
Fragmented operations and inconsistent professionalism across sites.
Low process maturity—requires hands-on transformation.
Marine sector complexity requires sensitivity to safety, regulation, and nuance.
Building trust and alignment across legacy leadership and new team.




YOUR BACKGROUND

Successful candidates will demonstrate:

Prior CEO or #2 experience in a PE-backed business.
Buy-and-build experience—deal sourcing, diligence, and integration.
Industry experience in Fire & Life Safety, Facilities Services, or related sectors.
Proven leadership across both blue- and white-collar environments.
Track record of building high-performing teams and scaling to $10M+ EBITDA.




YOUR CHARACTERISTICS

Strategic and structured thinker with execution bias.
High ownership mindset—proactive and solutions-driven.
Servant leader with strong team-building ability.
Comfortable rolling up sleeves—lead from the front.
High emotional intelligence with disciplined leadership.




LOCATION

Flexible – must be willing to travel weekly




COMPENSATION PACKAGE

Basic Salary: $325,000–$400,000
Bonus: 25–35%
Equity: Up to 5% of the Management Incentive Plan (MIP), fully aligned with sponsor’s contribution
Benefits: 401k, healthcare

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

You own end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and transformation to model training, validation, and online inference. You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

What You’ll Do


Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more.

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

Galois tackles the hardest problems in computer science. Our mission is to assure trust in critical systems that protect the privacy and integrity of information in the real world. Core to this is the application of formal analysis techniques that allow systems to be modeled, analyzed, and mathematically proven correct to ensure that a system behaves exactly as we intend under all circumstances.

We are a community of researchers, engineers, and operations people who are dedicated to creating trustworthiness in critical systems in every functional area of the organization. Our organization is highly collaborative, and we pursue working from first principles, transparency, building deep trust, learning and innovating, and creating space for you to be authentically you. Our unique organizational structure enables us to adapt to the needs of the innovative projects we deliver.

We are employee-owned and aspire to provide employees with a sense of freedom to pursue passions in and out of work — whether it be opportunities to learn, career growth, a sense of community, or whatever else brings you value as a person.

About This Role

We're looking for a new Principal Scientist passionate about expanding intelligent systems' capabilities to join Galois' research team. Our clients are looking at us to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in designing and deploying solutions that operate in challenging safety-critical domains ranging from defense to healthcare to aviation, specifically focusing on formally establishing and ensuring the trustworthiness and safety of these systems during operation.

We're hiring a Principal Scientist passionate about pushing the boundaries of ensuring AI systems' trustworthiness, safety, and reliability. In this role, you will drive a research agenda and develop R&D opportunities that involve engaging with customers to help solve real-world problems where the stakes are high. You will have the opportunity to collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of experts in algorithm design, mathematics, cognitive science, engineering, and psychology. Our objective is to perform rigorous research on AI systems focused on establishing their performance and trustworthiness in real-world contexts and by actual human users. Our research is not strictly limited to LLMs and related technologies - we're also investigating a variety of neurosymbolic and hybrid approaches to AI development for our clients, so if you're looking for a supportive atmosphere to trailblaze new ideas and AI frameworks, Galois is the place for you. You will also collaborate extensively with a team of experts in AI/ML, mathematics, cognitive science and engineering to advance the state-of-the-art in this field.

Together, we pursue innovative research that helps our clients build safe, reliable, and trustworthy systems. We're looking for people who can invent, learn, think, and inspire colleagues and clients. While we are specifically interested in researchers who desire to work on computational mathematics at scale, we are broadly interested in highly motivated researchers in the broad domain of computational mathematics, including computer arithmetic, algorithm analysis, applied probability, combinatorial scientific computing, control theory, data science, data-driven methods, discrete mathematics, discretization methods, graph algorithms, high-performance computing, integral equations and nonlocal models, linear and multilinear algebra, machine learning, mathematical analysis, meshing, modeling & simulation, multilevel/multiphysics/multiscale methods, numerical analysis, operations research, optimization, ordinary and partial differential equations, numerical solvers, statistical inference, time integration, and uncertainty quantification.

Responsibilities

As a Principal Scientist, you will:


Develop and lead an externally funded research program involving frequent client and government agency interactions
Collaborate across Galois, academia, government, and industry to advance active research and development programs
Publish and speak on your work, establishing a reputation for thought leadership in your domain of expertise
Competitive candidates for this role will be experienced researchers in their field and have demonstrated success envisioning, designing, capturing and leading significant research programs


We value hands-on experience in the proposal writing process and a deep interest in pursuing programs that connect one's research interests directly to actual customer needs. Excellent technical writing, verbal communication, and public speaking skills are essential.

Key Qualifications


Ph.D. in Computer Science or a related field with a history of high-quality academic or industrial research as evidenced by publications, involvement in the research community, and/or patent applications
A track record in obtaining external research funding
Passionate curiosity, interest in new ideas, and love of learning


Our Principals work in small teams and successfully interact with clients, partners, and other employees in a highly collaborative environment. Many of them also have Ph. D.s in their fields. We're looking for people who can invent, learn, think, and inspire these teams and our clients.

Eligibility and Clearance


Must be willing to undergo a security investigation and will need to meet eligibility requirements for access to classified information (Active clearance strongly preferred)
Must not require a U.S. government export license to authorize access to export-controlled technology and software required to perform this role


Location

We enjoy a hybrid work environment, and candidates may be based out of any of our offices in Arlington, VA, Dayton, OH, Minneapolis, MN, or Portland, OR. Additionally, being located in Boston, MA is also welcome.

Benefits

We offer a robust benefits package to provide for your and your family's well-being, including:


Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)
401(k) retirement plan with 5% employer match and immediate vesting
Fully paid medical insurance plans and dental and vision reimbursement plan
Health Savings Account (HSA) with generous employer contributions
Mental health and wellbeing support through our employee assistance program
5 weeks of paid time off and 9 days of paid company holidays each year
16 weeks of fully paid parental leave (available for new parents for birth, adoption, and fostering)
1 week of fully paid ""Blue Sky"" innovation time each year to pursue your interests


For more information on our benefits, visit Careers at Galois.

Compensation

Compensation is based on the value of your results, not your value as an employee or person. The compensation process, individual salaries, and criteria for salary changes are transparent to the entire company.

Our organization is highly collaborative, and we pursue working from first principles, transparency, building deep trust, learning and innovating, and creating space for you to be authentically you. Our unique organizational structure enables us to adapt to the needs of the innovative projects we deliver.

We are employee-owned and aspire to provide employees with a sense of freedom to pursue passions in and out of work — whether it be opportunities to learn, career growth, a sense of community, or whatever else brings you value as a person.

Research Engineers at Galois design and develop advanced technologies for safety- and security-critical systems, networks, and applications. Engineers work in small team settings and must successfully interact with clients, partners, and other employees in a highly cooperative, collaborative, and intellectually challenging environment.

Our research engineers work in small teams and successfully interact with clients, partners, and other employees in a highly collaborative environment. We're looking for people who can invent, learn, think, and inspire.

This role will be instrumental in analyzing cash flow streams, predicting decay and attrition, calculating expected value and expected returns, and ensuring we maximize returns while minimizing downside risks across a portfolio of recurring revenue assets.




You'll work at the intersection of finance, data, and operations, designing models and decision frameworks to support acquisition strategy and ongoing portfolio management.




Responsibilities




Build and maintain financial and risk models for evaluating residuals from merchant account portfolios and acquisition opportunities
Develop and refine attrition, decay, and lifetime value (LTV) models across merchants, agents, and verticals
Analyze merchant-level and portfolio-level performance data to identify patterns, red flags, and growth opportunities
Conduct scenario and sensitivity analysis around churn, volume volatility, and residual breakdowns
Design and maintain automated dashboards and reports on portfolio health, churn rates, ROI, and cash flow
Lead due diligence support for potential acquisitions (e.g., vetting statements, forecasting residual stability)
Collaborate with finance, M&A, legal, and operations to ensure full-spectrum risk awareness
Translate data into actionable insights and present to stakeholders and executives







Qualifications




5+ years of experience in data science, financial modeling, risk management or actuarial science 
Strong understanding of financial cash flow forecasting, NPV, IRR, and ROI
Solid command of Excel/Google Sheets, plus one or more of: Python, R, SQL
Experience with recurring revenue models (payments, SaaS, telecom, insurance, etc.)
Familiarity with Big Data frameworks and visualization tools (Cassandra, Hadoop, Spark, Tableau)
Familiarity with attrition/churn analysis and cohort modeling
Deep understanding of predictive modeling, machine-learning, clustering and classification techniques, and algorithms
Exceptional critical thinking and communication skills




What we do




With significant experience in payments, finance, and risk management, we purchase residual interests in merchant account portfolios. Merchant accounts allow merchants to accept credit and debit card payments. The companies that originate the merchant accounts generate residual income each time a card is swiped, tapped, or inserted into a card reader connected to the merchant accounts. We purchase those residual income streams.
