Since 2014, Acast has been building the world’s most valuable podcast marketplace, creating the technology that connects podcast creators, advertisers, and listeners. Its marketplace spans more than 140,000 podcasts, 3,300 advertisers, and one billion quarterly listens. Crucially, those listens are monetized wherever they happen—across any podcast app or listening platform.

About The Role

We are looking for a Software Engineer for the Acast Intelligence team. The ideal candidate would be able to build things like a modern recommendation engine, truly understanding it instead of just piecing it together, probably thanks to a solid background in statistics or related fields. We’re after someone who can cut through the hype, focus on real value that LLMs and related tech can bring, and always keep their eyes on the prize: driving growth for our company and our marketplace’s users.

Team’s scope

The team is focused on recommendation systems and intelligent automation. Our product vision is a set of connected systems that turn deep and broad data into decisions and reduce friction, helping one person achieve as much as five would. We build to enable podcast creators to grow their audience, advertisers to be matched to creators, and internal teams to focus on what matters most instead of getting bogged down in chasing data.

This work has a company-wide impact.

Team composition and tools

The team is small but made up of seasoned engineers. We deploy on AWS, and most of our company’s code is in TypeScript, including the infrastructure, but some of this particular team’s code is in Python for the reasons you’d expect. We collaborate on our projects and keep the work process light. Our PM knows the space in and out. We’ve shipped the first version of a recommendation engine, and there’s plenty more in the pipeline. There aren’t many established best practices or ready answers in this field, so the work is a lot about experimentation and learning.

Experience we’re looking for


Background and interest in some of the following: statistics, machine learning, LLMs, recommendation systems, RAG systems (experience with their evaluation is a plus)
Proficiency in Python, familiarity with TypeScript (or the other way around)
Familiarity with vector databases
A habit of staying up to date in a seriously evolving field
Experience with or interest in learning AWS
Experience building software that’s actually delightful for the users
A pragmatic mindset for making sensible trade-offs
Interest in podcasts is really optional, but if you have it, this job will be so much more fun


Logistics

We are remote-first but prefer to have teams in similar timezones; for this team, this means an overlap of at least 4 hours with CET (UTC+1).

Culture

Acast is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, national origin or any of the other wonderful characteristics that make us different.

Culture is our number one priority as a business. We believe people come first, and we work every day to enable autonomy, continuous improvement and bring out the best in people. We’re global and have remote teams, so it’s even more important that we strive for an open, inclusive and caring environment where everyone feels visible and welcome.

We consider ourselves a modern organization driven by strong values to create the best, most fulfilling and nurturing culture.

We very much look forward to finding the next great person to join our cause!

We are looking for multiple data scientists or machine learning engineers focusing on generative AI for text, and Large Language Models.

At Nordea, we see that the world is changing fast – and we want to be one step ahead of the curve. That’s why we’re deeply committed to providing the financial solutions of tomorrow to our customers. We’re creating an agile environment where we experiment and grow together – and we need your ideas and unique background. With us, you’ll be in good company with a chance to make your mark on something bigger.

About This Opportunity

Meet the AI & Machine Learning team. Our role is to improve how we detect and investigate financial crime with the help of AI and machine learning, to keep our customers, Nordea and society safe.

Our team is about 25 people working out of Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen as a part of the group financial crime prevention (GFCP) unit that provides financial crime prevention services to all of the bank.

Collaboration. Ownership. Passion. Courage. These are the values that guide us in how we work and how we make decisions – and that we imagine you share with us.

What you’ll be doing:


Prototype and explore the feasibility of new AI use cases in collaboration with business stakeholders
Implement, deploy, and monitor our AI applications
Rigorously evaluate and improve the quality of our AI applications
Keep up to date with the latest AI developments to shape our Gen AI best practices and tooling

Who You Are

This is the right role if you have a passion to solve challenging problems - with the help of data, software and AI. As a person, you look past the noise, to do what is right. You prefer action to talking, but when you talk, people want to listen.

Your experience and background:


MSc or PhD in a field related to predictive or statistical modelling.
At least 2 years’ experience developing machine learning solutions in python, with a focus on model validation and explainability in a production grade system.
Exposure to multiple predictive AI projects, either through work or Kaggle or similar.
A knack for tackling complex problems and creating simple solutions.
Strong interpersonal communication and presentation skills, explaining complex ideas and technology across domains.


It would be ideal if you also:


Experience from working on AWS
Experience developing production grade code


What We Offer

People come here when they want to get somewhere. For some, it’s to take their career to the next level. For others, it’s to break new ground within their area of expertise – in other words, with us, you will always move forward.

A culture that fosters performance and growth in one of the largest Nordic banks, offering various opportunities to evolve, develop and learn from brilliant colleagues with diverse backgrounds in a vibrant working environment.

Hybrid working model – we believe in the value of bringing people together and at the same time we embrace the freedom of flexibility.

Diversity and inclusion are a natural part of our daily work. We know that an inclusive workplace is a sustainable one. We genuinely believe that our diverse backgrounds, experiences, characteristics and traits make us stronger together. Every day we strive to find new ways to improve diversity and inclusion within our community e.g. we have signed the European Diversity Charters in the countries where we operate to show our commitment and engage with others to continue learning and improving.

If this sounds like you, get in touch!

I en ständigt föränderlig värld kan trygghet inte tas för given, och därför står vi alltid redo, dygnet runt, året om. Som arbetsgivare erbjuder vi en trygg arbetsplats med kollektivavtal och förmånliga anställningsvillkor, samtidigt som vi värdesätter en stark kultur och gemenskap. Här får du möjlighet att växa både yrkesmässigt och som person, samtidigt som du blir en del av ett engagerat företag som verkligen vill göra skillnad. Vi är en oberoende första kontakt i trygghetskedjan och arbetar nära samhällets hjälpresurser för att skydda liv, egendom och miljö. Hos oss får du vara med och bidra till ett säkrare Sverige – och känna att ditt arbete gör skillnad.







SOS Alarm stärker nu sin kapacitet inom avancerad analys och prediktion. Som vår första Data Scientist får du ett tydligt uppdrag: etablera och driva arbetet med framtagande av lokala maskininlärningsmodeller och prediktiv analys i en samhällskritisk verksamhet. Ditt arbete kommer att stödja allt från operativa insatser till strategisk planering.




Rollen är ny och kommer med stor frihet att påverka metoder och verktyg, men också höga krav på leverans. Du förväntas snabbt identifiera områden med hög potential, etablera strukturer och ta fram lösningar som skapar konkret värde för organisationen.




Om rollen

Du ansvarar för att utveckla och förvalta prediktiva modeller och ML-lösningar i vår lokala miljö. Det innebär att du arbetar nära våra befintliga dataplattformar, BI-lösningar och verksamhetsnära funktioner. Vi ser att du har vana att driva hela kedjan – från problemformulering till färdig modell i produktion.




Exempel på arbetsuppgifer:

Utveckla lokala ML-modeller för till exempel prognoser av samtalsvolymer, resursbehov eller geografisk belastning
Utföra statistiska analyser, mönsterigenkänning och simuleringar
Arbeta med vår lokala dataplattform och befintliga BI-verktyg för att bygga skalbara lösningar
Kommunicera analysresultat till olika delar av organisationen
Etablera struktur och arbetssätt för Data Science inom ramen för BI & Analys




Kvalifikationer

Akademisk examen inom statistik, datavetenskap, matematik eller motsvarande
Flerårig erfarenhet av prediktiv modellering och maskininlärning i praktisk tillämpning
Mycket goda kunskaper i Python, R eller motsvarande
Mycket goda kunskaper i SQL
Erfarenhet av att arbeta med on-prem-lösningar, gärna i kombination med molnmiljöer
Vana att ta ett helhetsansvar från analys till produktion
Förmåga att kommunicera komplexa modeller och resultat till icke-tekniska intressenter
Svenska i tal och skrift samt svenskt medborgarskap




Teknisk miljö

Du får tillgång till den lokala infrastruktur och de verktyg som idag används inom BI och dataplattform. Miljön omfattar både traditionell databearbetning och moderna verktyg för prediktiv analys. Du förväntas kunna arbeta inom ramarna för vår befintliga tekniska arkitektur – men också bidra till dess utveckling.




Organisation och placering

Du rapporterar till Chef BI & Analys, inom ledningsgruppen för Finans & Business Control. Placering är i första hand Stockholm. Göteborg eller annan ort där vi har verksamhet kan diskuteras.




Värdegrund

Hos oss är våra värderingar, Professionella & Empatiska samt Ansvarstagande & Samverkande, något som genomsyrar hela kulturen på SOS Alarm och att du kan relatera till dessa är en förutsättning för att trivas hos oss!

Filed is building the first AI tax preparer trusted by America’s accounting firms. This industry might seem boring—but it’s a $70B backbone of the economy that’s breaking under a talent shortage no one has solved. We’re fixing it—fast.

In just 9 months, we’ve hit strong product-market fit, are generating fast-growing, sticky revenue, and are backed by top-tier investors. We’re not a tool—we’re the missing workforce firms have been sounding the alarm for. We’re building the future with expanding our already 30 person team, with those who want to say “I was there when it all started.”

⸻

Here’s Why This Is a Terrible Job

This is not a job for someone who likes to move slow.

We operate week to week with ruthless speed. Sometimes we’re going in the wrong direction, but more times than not we’re going in the right direction.

If you need a few extra days to perfect your model, chances are there’s already a handful of team members blocked behind you.

We use tools like Cursor, OpenAI, and Gemini to prototype fast, test in prod, and push to users in hours—not quarters.

You’ll be operating at the intersection of large language models, user behavior, regulatory compliance, and structured knowledge graphs.

There are no clean datasets. No definitive papers. Just judgment calls, ambiguity, and noise from every direction.

You’ll ask yourself, is this really the work?

It is. And it’s not for everyone.

⸻

Here's Why It's The Best Career Choice You'll Make

We’re hyperscaling. We’re very well-funded. Generating very fast revenue, and have reached a strong product market fit score all within 9 months.

We’re building what tax pros call impossible. A product that behaves like a teammate, not just another tool.

We run reviews every 4 months. We operate with total transparency around pay, performance, and progress.

You’ll be paid above market. You’ll earn equity that grows fast.

And you’ll have full autonomy to make high-impact decisions.

You’ll ship models because you believe in them, not because they passed a review board.

You’ll talk to users weekly. You’ll drive outcomes end to end.

We’ll tell you the goal. How you reach it—prompting, fine-tuning, embeddings, retrieval, structured data—is up to you.

We expect you to build a customer Oracle. An internal simulator so precise it can predict what a user will ask, before they even ask it.

That comes from immersion, curiosity, and care.

⸻

The Teammate We're Looking For


Thinks in probabilities, systems, and second-order consequences
Navigates ambiguity across LLMs, APIs, and semi-structured corpora
Gets excited by the edge cases most people run away from
No research-for-research’s-sake — we ship fast and learn even faster
Big bonus if you’ve shipped AI products into production, not just demos


⸻

What You’ll Be Responsible For


Designing and implementing LLM-powered workflows across tax, finance, and compliance
Building agentic frameworks (adk, langchain, crewai and the likes)
Building and scaling Graphiti-like knowledge systems for memory and retrieval
Owning prompt pipelines, vector stores, fine-tuned models, and evals
Becoming an Oracle with a model of the customer and the domain in your head


⸻

Your Hard Skillset


Deep understanding of how LLMs actually work under the hood—beyond the hype
Fluency with APIs like OpenAI, Gemini, Claude; experience with structured evals
Comfortable working across Python beyond notebooks and can write production worthy services that handle millions of complicated documents and
Experience with cloud infra (GCP or Azure)
Strong grasp of embeddings, RAG, structured retrieval, and production-grade inference
Bonus if you’ve contributed to or built internal tooling for model debugging or evals


⸻

Your Soft Skillset


Ruthlessly pragmatic—knows when to ship and when to iterate
Empathetic with users and critical of vague assumptions
Deeply collaborative across product, engineering, and operations
Obsessively curious—you want to understand everything about the domain you’re automating
You own your outcomes—and love having your work in front of real users daily


⸻

Growth And Levels

We operate on six levels, from Level 1 to Level 6. Each reflects increasing ownership, impact, and scope with meaningful jumps in salary and equity.

We review levels every 4 months. Promotions are based on output and ownership, not tenure.

This isn’t a comfy AI role. It’s fast, focused, and brutally user-driven.

You will build fast. You will learn fast. You will own what you ship.

⸻

The process


Quick intro call
Code and system walkthrough + async technical task
Final round with our team
Optional 2 to 3 day paid trial
Then we decide together if this is the right fight


⸻

If you want to work with real users, real constraints, and build AI that goes far beyond chatbot demos—this is it.

Compensation Range: $71.5K - $149.5K

We're working with a cutting-edge e-commerce startup backed by world-class investors. Our client is building a creative merchandising app that transforms how fashion and lifestyle brands curate their online stores.




They're now building a new product, a GPT-Search function for e-commerce stores and are looking for an ML Engineer to drive this product and take ownership.




What you’ll do

Lead the design and development of a new AI-powered search tool that replaces traditional search bars with a smart, conversational interface.
Build and improve systems like RAG pipelines, semantic search, reranking, and personalisation for e-commerce.
Quickly prototype and launch features based on real feedback from merchants and shoppers.
Work closely with founders, product managers, and engineers to create a seamless shopping experience.
Take full ownership of machine learning components—from testing ideas to deploying them—including prompt design, fine-tuning, evaluation, and speed optimisation.
Explore new models and APIs to find the best balance between performance, cost, and user experience.
Help shape how the AI system adapts to different merchants, balancing automation with brand-specific customisation.
Play a key role in shaping the team’s engineering culture—how we experiment, learn, and move fast together.




Who you are

You think like a founder—comfortable building quick prototypes, taking on different roles, and navigating uncertainty.
You're excited about the fast-moving world of AI, especially LLMs, vector search, and conversational interfaces, and want to apply them in real products.
You’ve worked on machine learning products in production, ideally involving smart search, personalised results, or large-scale model use.
You thrive in fast-paced environments where priorities shift and builders make the biggest impact.
You care more about making things happen than following rigid processes
You’re practical—you’ll test prompts before training models and launch early versions before perfecting them.
Bonus points if you’ve worked on e-commerce search, fine-tuned foundation models, or used tools like FAISS, Weaviate, LangChain, or OpenAI APIs.




In Return

Competitive salary and equity
4000 SEK in annual wellness allowance
30 paid vacation days
Work from our office in Stockholm or full-time remote
Monthly co-working allowance if remote-based
Annual learning allowance
Company Laptop
Fun Quarterly off-sites




This is a great opportunity to be part of a financially secure and solid working culture where you can make a significant impact on this product and its growth.

The Opportunity

We’re working with a fast-growing, VC-backed Fintech company on a mission to transform how modern finance teams operate. Following a recent $16M funding round, they’re scaling an AI-powered platform designed to radically simplify workflows for accountants and finance professionals. At the heart of their product is intelligent automation, redefining back-office operations through seamless technology.

They’re now looking for an AI Engineer to join the team and help build smart, intuitive features that bring automation and intelligence to complex, manual workflows, delivering production-ready software that scales with real-world use.







What You’ll Be Doing

As an AI Engineer, you’ll work at the intersection of AI innovation and real-world application. Collaborating closely with engineers, designers, and product managers, you’ll design and deploy intelligent systems that drive measurable efficiency. In this role, you will:

Designing and implementing intelligent automation workflows across tax, finance, and compliance domains.
Building scalable knowledge systems for storing, retrieving, and reasoning over complex information.
Managing end-to-end AI pipelines, including prompts, vector databases, fine-tuned models, and evaluation frameworks.
Developing deep product and domain expertise to anticipate user needs and shape smarter solutions.
















What They’re Looking For

They’re after someone who’s not just technically excellent, but curious, creative, and excited by complexity. Ideally, you bring:




3+ years of hands-on commercial experience building AI-driven products in a product-based organisation (not a consultancy or academic setting).
Deep understanding of large language models at a foundational level - not just surface-level familiarity.
Background in Software Engineering or Data Science, with a strong foundation in writing production-quality code and solving real-world problems.
Strong Python skills with experience building or fine-tuning LLMs, managing model pipelines, and deploying solutions in production using modern cloud infrastructure (GCP or Azure)
Solid grasp of embeddings, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structured retrieval, and production-grade inference.







Bonus Points For:

Bonus points for contributing to or building internal tools for model evaluation and debugging.
Experience with Typescript







Why Join?

Join an early stage company backed by top-tier investors and growing fast.
Work on a product that directly impacts how thousands of professionals work.
Collaborate with a team of ambitious, low-ego engineers, designers, and operators.
Competitive salary and equity.
Hybrid working model

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About Merchant Group At Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation, and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Please note that we might have delays due to the peak holiday season.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Master your toolkit. By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.
Build stuff that matters. Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.
Simplify relentlessly. Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities—just let us know through this form.

Before you apply
If you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.

To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you’re welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries—depending on what we agree at the offer stage.

If the role speaks to you and you’re excited to give your best, we’d love to hear from you. Apply now—we can’t wait to meet you.

Er du vild med økonomi, statistik og matematisk modellering? Trives du med at finde mønstre i data og omsætte dem til meningsfulde indsigter i Python – eller andre statistiske programmeringssprog? Så er det måske dig, vi leder efter. Vi søger en bachelor- eller kandidatstuderende, der ved siden af sin videregående uddannelse ønsker at være en del af regnekraften bag rådgivningen til Nordens største virksomheder.

Hvem er vi?

Choreograph er en del af WPP Media, som er Nordens største bureaugruppe. Vi arbejder med rådgivning inden for marketing, media og salg. I data science-delen af Choreograph er udgangspunktet for vores rådgivning altid forskellige former for matematisk og statistisk analyse – herunder salgsmodeller, media buying-algoritmer, geografiske eksperimenter, dashboards m.m. Vi arbejder tæt sammen i et fagligt stærkt og anerkendt team, hvor nøgleordene er innovation, selvstændighed og faglig stolthed. Læs mere om os her: Choreograph

Jobbet

Vores kunder har store datasæt, komplekse problemstillinger og sammen skal vi omsætte de analytiske resultater til konkrete anbefalinger. En del af den tekniske udfordring er, at datamængderne konstant vokser og bliver stadig mere komplekse. Du skal være med til at løse denne udfordring. Sammen med en data scientist skal du på professionel vis håndtere kundens data, levere rådgivning og præsentere anbefalinger, som optimerer kundens investeringer baseret på et solidt analytisk grundlag.

Din daglige rutine som studentermedhjælper vil hovedsageligt være at opdatere, automatisere og klargøre data til analyser, samt opsætte indledende resultater i PowerPoint og PowerBI, alt imens du opbygger solid viden om branchen og de anvendte metoder.

Faglige og personlige kvalifikationer

Du er blandt årgangens skarpeste inden for økonomi, matematisk optimering, databehandling, statistik og/eller økonometri. Efter et introduktionsforløb, hvor du bliver fortrolig med vores anvendte datakilder og systemer, vil du selvstændigt arbejde med databehandlingen og udarbejdelse af præsentationer – i takt med, at du stifter bekendtskab med branchen, vil du få muligheden for at bistå i rådgivningen til virksomhederne og derved udvikle dine færdigheder som konsulent.

Vi forestiller os, at du:


Er i gang med en uddannelse, der giver et solidt fundament inden for økonomi og statistik
Har arbejdet med Microsoft Office-pakken (særligt PowerPoint og Excel), har kendskab til programmeringssprog som Python, og enten har erfaring med - eller interesse for - at arbejde med cloud-løsninger som Google BigQuery og SQL-baserede databaser
Er grundig, trives med at arbejde selvstændigt, og er god til at overholde deadlines
Har en vis forståelse for statistisk programmering og evt. dashboardløsninger


Vi tilbyder

Et fagligt udfordrende studiejob på ca. 15-20 timer om ugen i et engageret og dynamisk team med mere end 60 dygtige kollegaer fra hele Norden. Vi er en social gruppe, der holder af at tilbringe tid sammen uden for arbejdstiden blandt andet med padel, funktionel træning, karaoke, i fredagsbaren samt ture til udlandet, hvor vi til oktober planlægger en tur til Budapest.

Vi har højt til loftet og forventer at vores medarbejdere arbejder selvstændigt og er proaktive. Det er vores klare ambition, at du efter at have færdiggjort din uddannelse har mulighed for og lyst til at blive en del af vores organisation som fastansat.

Vores kontor ligger på Holmbladsgade 133, bag Kløvermarken på Amager, i gåafstand til Lergravsparken Metro. Vi har en fremragende kantine, hvor vi også tilbyder morgenmad, samt en masse sociale arrangementer i løbet af året, attraktive personalegoder og meget mere.

Ansøgning

Hvis ovenstående passer på dig, så send din ansøgning, CV og relevante dokumenter via linket på denne side. Har du spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte vores Talent Lead Johan Hillers på johan.hillers@WPPMedia.com

We’re delighted to be working with one of Europe’s most exciting tech startups, as they continue their mission to become the leader in their market.




They’re looking to onboard an experienced backend engineer, to join one of their internal teams.




The Role




In this role, you'll be working as part of the Business Ops team - which focuses on internal processes, developer tools & creating the best possible work environment for both technical & non-technical team members.




You'll work closely with a team of engineers as well as non-technical stakeholders, before crafting innovative solutions to every day problems.




You'll be using Python, with Django being used as their main framework. Whilst this specific role is purely backend focused, they do have space for a Full Stack Engineer in the near future - so don't hesitate to reach out if you have solid TypeScript experience too.




What You’ll Bring




5+ years of commercial software engineering experience
3+ years of experience working with Python
Demonstratable experience of working with internal teams with non-technical staff
Any experience in TypeScript is a plus, but certainly not required




The Company




With a current team of over 400 and huge growth planned in the next few years, this is an opportunity to get in while the rocket ship’s still near the launchpad.




Their tech is used by tens of thousands of teams across the globe every week—helping analysts record, analyse, and improve performance with ease.




The company’s mission is a positive and inclusive one: to ensure access to performance tools, regardless of background, budget, or location.




Their Copenhagen HQ is the coolest office I’ve ever visited, so I’m sure you’ll agree. Most of their team are onsite between 3-5 days a week. They offer flexibility on remote working, but their staff like being in the office more often than not.

Vi er en energikoncern der leverer vand og fjernvarme i trekantområdet samt el, bredbånd og ladeløsninger til kunder i hele Danmark. Vi har inden for de seneste år udskiftet alle vores digitale kundevendte platforme, og har nu en stærk digital tilstedeværelse med vores hjemmeside, flere selvbetjeningsløsninger, mobilapps og en marketing automation platform. Platformene er integrerede med hinanden og bygget på en moderne og prisbelønnet integrationsplatform, hvor data er gjort tilgængelige via microservices.

I Digitale Kundeplatforme drifter og videreudvikler vi platformene i tæt samarbejde med andre forretningsområder og vores eget tilknyttede IT-udviklingsteam. Vi er allerede i gang med at implementere databaserede løsninger, som en del af vores digitale kundeoplevelser, og ønsker nu at tage næste skridt og sætte fart på udviklingen.

Om rollen

Du bliver teamets specialist i machine learning og AI og får ansvar for at udvikle, teste og implementere modeller, der udgør det datamæssige fundament for nye digitale løsninger og services til vores kunder.

Du kommer til at arbejde hands-on med modellering, databehandling og kode – i tæt samspil med relevante afdelinger såsom IT-infrastruktur, Data Warehouse og Data Governance. Derudover vil du arbejde sammen med dine kollegaer i teamet, der arbejder med app, web, selvbetjening og marketing automation, om at integrere modellerne direkte i vores digitale platforme og løsninger, så de skaber reel værdi for vores kunder.

Hos EWII arbejder andre data scientists med forskellige formål på tværs af organisationen, og vi har allerede et stærkt teknologi- og datasetup på plads. I denne rolle får du ansvar for at udvikle modeller baseret på kundernes forbrugs- og adfærdsdata – kombineret med relevante tredjepartsdata såsom vejr- og boligdata.

Eksempler på arbejdsopgaver



Udvikling og optimering af prædiktive og præskriptive modeller, som danner udgangspunkt for vores automatiserede kommunikation
Udvikling og optimering af forbrugsalarmer baseret på machine learning og anomalidetektion, som automatisk kan opdage, hvis den enkelte kundes forbrug afviger fra deres normalforbrug
Udvikling af personaliserede forbrugsrapporter baseret på dataanalyse og integreret med generativt AI, som genererer individuelle rapporter med grafer og forklarende tekst.
Udforske nye teknologier og eksperimentere med ML- og AI-baserede løsninger på tværs af platformene.



Det tilbyder vi 

Som medarbejder i EWII er det ikke kun dit arbejde, der er i centrum - du får også mange personalegoder, der er værd at arbejde for. Hvilke goder, du kan nyde godt af, kan du blive klogere på her. 

Din profil

Vi forestiller os, at du har en uddannelse inden for datalogi, machine learning, statistik eller lignende – fx cand.scient., cand.polyt. eller cand.it med specialisering i data science. Du har allerede nogen erfaring, og har et ønske om at arbejde tættere sammen med forretningen om dine modeller.

Vi lægger vægt på, at du:



Har praktisk erfaring med dataanalyse, statistisk modellering og machine learning i cloud-baserede miljøer, herunder udvikling af prædiktive og preskriptive modeller på Azure Databricks-platformen.
Har stærke kompetencer inden for Python og SQL.
Forstår, hvordan modeller omsættes til værdi i en digital forretningskontekst og gerne i forbindelse med digitale kundevendte platforme.
Trives i krydsfeltet mellem teknik og forretning og kan forklare komplekse modeller og resultater til ikke-tekniske kollegaer
Er nysgerrig, forretningsorienteret og trives med et stort selvstændigt ansvar for dit ansvarsområde, men sætter pris på at arbejde teamorienteret mod vores fælles vision og mål.



I rollen får du



En central rolle i et ambitiøst digitalt team med stærkt mandat og stor indflydelse.
Frihed til at eksperimentere og udvikle dine egne idéer til ML- og AI-baserede kundeløsninger
Samarbejde med kollegaer, der arbejder med digital performance, UX, app- og webudvikling, marketing automation og dataplatforme
Adgang til en moderne teknologistak samtidig med, at du bliver en del af en virksomhed med strategisk fokus på digital innovation.

About CEGO

CEGO is an ambitious software company located by the waterfront in Aalborg. We offer an informal work culture with flexibility, freedom, and a high degree of trust. We operate Spilnu.dk, one of Denmark's largest online casinos, and have expanded our success to the UK with Happy Tiger. We develop everything in-house using open-source technologies from games and platforms to our upcoming AI projects.




About the role

We’re hiring for a newly established position as AI Software Engineer to join us on-site at our office in Aalborg, where you’ll be responsible for developing next-generation AI solutions based on Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents, and modern AI architectures.




This is a pioneering role where you'll be our first in-house specialist in this field. You'll bring a new technological toolbox to CEGO and play a key role in defining how we work with AI going forward. You'll collaborate closely with our talented developers in the Platform department, who will provide strong technical sparring - but you should thrive in leading the way into new territory.

You’ll be part of our Platform department consisting of 38 colleagues, including DevOps, software developers, UX designers, and frontend developers.




Your main tasks include:

Develop and implement AI solutions using LLMs, AI agents, and machine learning techniques such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation), ReACT, and meta-prompting
Design and optimize agent-based systems using technologies like LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, or similar
Build APIs and integrations to connect AI solutions with our existing systems
Contribute to innovation and prototyping across teams and business areas
Stay up to date on AI trends and evaluate how they can be applied to create business value




About you

We imagine you're a proactive team player with a developer mindset and a commercial edge. We’re looking for someone who:




Has a solid understanding of machine learning and can distinguish between classical ML and modern LLM applications
Is familiar with techniques like prompt chaining and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
Understands agent-based AI systems and workflow orchestration
Has experience with API development and system integration
Is comfortable evaluating and optimizing AI model performance
Is curious and eager to explore new technologies




We offer:

A chance to join one of Aalborg’s most ambitious and attractive workplaces
Full ownership of our own products and roadmaps - no clients or external deadlines
No time tracking
An agile, flat organization with fast decision-making
Flexible working hours, 30 minutes of paid daily break, and a no-overtime policy
Perks like daily breakfast, in-house gym, personal training twice a week, and massage
A strong focus on well-being, professionalism, and collaboration
Health insurance and pension plan




We know that engaged and skilled employees create the best results. That’s why we work actively to ensure an environment where you can thrive and be challenged at the same time.




How to apply

Submit your CV and a motivated application via our website as soon as possible. We review applications on an ongoing basis. Start date is as soon as possible.




We encourage all qualified candidates to apply - regardless of gender, age, religion, or ethnic background.




About CEGO A/S

Founded in 2000, CEGO A/S operates a number of subsidiaries running online casinos in both Denmark and internationally. In 2012, we launched Spilnu.dk and were among the first companies to receive a casino license when Denmark liberalized its gambling laws.

Outside Denmark, we operate in the UK under the brand Happy Tiger. CEGO A/S is owned by three Aalborg-based entrepreneurs and the private equity firm VIA equity.

At WasteHero, we're on a mission to build the most advanced, intelligent municipal software platform in Europe. Our customers are cities and waste companies – the backbone of public life – and we help them digitize operations, optimize resources, and become smarter every day. Now, we're ready to go AI-first. And we need a builder.

We're looking for a Fullstack AI Engineer who can combine classic engineering skills with modern AI tooling to ship real, production-grade AI agents, flows, and tools – fast. This isn't a research role. This is about building things that work.

What You’ll Do


Build internal AI agents that automate everything from public tender qualification to API-based integration flows.
Use OpenAI (GPT-4o), LangChain, n8n, Supabase, and custom Python/Node scripts to develop real, end-to-end flows.
Translate domain knowledge (from product, integration, support) into prompt-based tools, scripts, and interfaces.
Develop backend logic and connect with our main platform via REST APIs, webhooks, and Supabase.
Collaborate directly with our founder, product team, and engineers to prioritize high-impact use cases.
Document and test your agents so they can scale across customers, countries, and products.
Optionally: build or connect frontend UIs via Lovable, Retool, or React.


Who You Are


You have 2–4 years of experience as a fullstack or backend developer.
You've already built real things with AI – agents, automations, internal tools, or API wrappers. (We’re not looking for beginners.)
You're comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript or Python, REST APIs, and database logic.
You’ve used tools like LangChain, GPT, Claude, Supabase, or n8n — and ideally connected them together.
You love shipping fast, learning fast, and solving real customer problems.
You think in systems. You see the flow between tools, prompts, users, and data.
Bonus: experience with public infrastructure, tenders, waste, logistics, or ERP systems.


Why Join Us


Work on real-world AI problems — not gimmicks.
Be part of a small, ambitious, and product-driven team with deep market traction.
Ship and own projects that get used by municipalities and companies across Europe.
Help define how AI is applied in one of the most operationally complex and underserved domains: waste & city infrastructure.
Enjoy full autonomy, fast feedback loops, and the ability to shape the product and stack.
Located in Aarhus? Great. Prefer hybrid or remote (within CET ±2)? Also great.


Tech Stack You’ll Touch


GPT-4o / OpenAI Functions / Claude
LangChain / n8n / Supabase
Python / Node.js / TypeScript
REST APIs (internal and customer)
Lovable / Retool / React (optional)
Other tech stacks that can improve efficiency


Compensation


Competitive salary based on experience
Equity/warrants
Office in Aarhus C with hybrid flexibility
Real ownership. No bureaucracy.

Her er en meningsfuld opgave, hvor du gør en forskel gennem nærvær og tydelighed.

Om opgaven

En skøn 7-årig dreng glæder sig til gode eftermiddagstimer sammen med dig efter skole og i nogle weekender. Han har infantil autisme, er snakkesalig, har en god hukommelse og elsker alt fra Lego og Minecraft til Pokémon-jagt på telefonen.

På hverdage henter du familiens el-ladcykel i hjemmet og cykler hen for at hente ham fra skole (ca. 2 km hver vej). Resten af tiden bruger I på hans yndlingsaktiviteter – det kan være leg derhjemme, ture på legepladsen eller fx et besøg i legeland i weekenden.

Drengen trives bedst med tydelige rammer og har brug for støtte til at forstå sociale signaler. Jeres samvær foregår i et roligt tempo, hvor du sætter rammen og følger hans initiativer.

Vær opmærksom på, at der er kat i hjemmet.

Om dig

Du har kendskab til autisme og er god til at skabe struktur. Du har tålmodighed, kan bevare roen og arbejder anerkendende med drengen i centrum. Du kan være pædagog eller ufaglært med relevant erfaring.

Arbejdstid

Stillingen er på ca. 45 timer om måneden fordelt sådan:


Hverdage: Mandag og torsdag kl. 13.15–16.15 (ca. 25 timer/måned)
Weekender: Vagter efter aftale, typisk ca. 20 timer/måned


Vi tilbyder

Du bliver en del af en familieejet virksomhed med en masse engagerede medarbejdere. Du har en fast rådgiver, som du altid kan få sparring hos. Udenfor kontorets åbningstid er der altid en bemandet vagttelefon, så du er aldrig alene. Løn og pension i henhold til Landsoverenskomst for handicaphjælp i borgers eget hjem (minus BPA) indgået mellem FOA og Dansk Erhverv. Du er dækket af DUOS’ ansvars- og arbejdsskadeforsikring og sundhedsforsikring er en del af din pensionsordning. Du modtager relevant introduktion og løbende opkvalificering - og så kan du slet ikke undgå at udvikle dig både personligt og fagligt, når du arbejder med mennesker hos os i DUOS.

We’re delighted to be working with one of Europe’s most exciting tech startups, as they continue their mission to become the leader in their market.




They’re looking to onboard an experienced backend engineer, to join one of their internal teams.




The Role




In this role, you'll be working as part of the Business Ops team - which focuses on internal processes, developer tools & creating the best possible work environment for both technical & non-technical team members.




You'll work closely with a team of engineers as well as non-technical stakeholders, before crafting innovative solutions to every day problems.




You'll be using Python, with Django being used as their main framework. Whilst this specific role is purely backend focused, they do have space for a Full Stack Engineer in the near future - so don't hesitate to reach out if you have solid TypeScript experience too.




What You’ll Bring




5+ years of commercial software engineering experience
3+ years of experience working with Python
Demonstratable experience of working with internal teams with non-technical staff
Any experience in TypeScript is a plus, but certainly not required




The Company




With a current team of over 400 and huge growth planned in the next few years, this is an opportunity to get in while the rocket ship’s still near the launchpad.




Their tech is used by tens of thousands of teams across the globe every week—helping analysts record, analyse, and improve performance with ease.




The company’s mission is a positive and inclusive one: to ensure access to performance tools, regardless of background, budget, or location.




Their Copenhagen HQ is the coolest office I’ve ever visited, so I’m sure you’ll agree. Most of their team are onsite between 3-5 days a week. They offer flexibility on remote working, but their staff like being in the office more often than not.




Sound good? Apply here or contact me directly on jamie.crowley@amicusjobs.com.

At WasteHero, we're on a mission to build the most advanced, intelligent municipal software platform in Europe. Our customers are cities and waste companies – the backbone of public life – and we help them digitize operations, optimize resources, and become smarter every day. Now, we're ready to go AI-first. And we need a builder.

We're looking for a Fullstack AI Engineer who can combine classic engineering skills with modern AI tooling to ship real, production-grade AI agents, flows, and tools – fast. This isn't a research role. This is about building things that work.

What You’ll Do


Build internal AI agents that automate everything from public tender qualification to API-based integration flows.
Use OpenAI (GPT-4o), LangChain, n8n, Supabase, and custom Python/Node scripts to develop real, end-to-end flows.
Translate domain knowledge (from product, integration, support) into prompt-based tools, scripts, and interfaces.
Develop backend logic and connect with our main platform via REST APIs, webhooks, and Supabase.
Collaborate directly with our founder, product team, and engineers to prioritize high-impact use cases.
Document and test your agents so they can scale across customers, countries, and products.
Optionally: build or connect frontend UIs via Lovable, Retool, or React.


Who You Are


You have 2–4 years of experience as a fullstack or backend developer.
You've already built real things with AI – agents, automations, internal tools, or API wrappers. (We’re not looking for beginners.)
You're comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript or Python, REST APIs, and database logic.
You’ve used tools like LangChain, GPT, Claude, Supabase, or n8n — and ideally connected them together.
You love shipping fast, learning fast, and solving real customer problems.
You think in systems. You see the flow between tools, prompts, users, and data.
Bonus: experience with public infrastructure, tenders, waste, logistics, or ERP systems.


Why Join Us


Work on real-world AI problems — not gimmicks.
Be part of a small, ambitious, and product-driven team with deep market traction.
Ship and own projects that get used by municipalities and companies across Europe.
Help define how AI is applied in one of the most operationally complex and underserved domains: waste & city infrastructure.
Enjoy full autonomy, fast feedback loops, and the ability to shape the product and stack.
Located in Aarhus? Great. Prefer hybrid or remote (within CET ±2)? Also great.


Tech Stack You’ll Touch


GPT-4o / OpenAI Functions / Claude
LangChain / n8n / Supabase
Python / Node.js / TypeScript
REST APIs (internal and customer)
Lovable / Retool / React (optional)
Other tech stacks that can improve efficiency


Compensation


Competitive salary based on experience
Equity/warrants
Office in Aarhus C with hybrid flexibility
Real ownership. No bureaucracy.

Og har du samtidig lyst til at arbejde i en ambitiøs international virksomhed med kollegaer i mange lande. Så er du måske den R&D Mechanical Engineer, vi søger til Patient Handling ved Horsens?

Om jobbet

Du vil skulle arbejde med produktudvikling omfattende flere forskellige teknologier, materialetyper og produktområder. Produkterne er omfattet af det medicinske regulativ (MDR) og en – på sigt - god forståelse af dette, markedet og kunderne er væsentlige forudsætninger for succes i rollen.

Opgaverne vil primært omfatte længerevarende udviklingsforløb kombineret med mindre kortsigtede projekter/opgaver, der til tider besluttes iværksat med baggrund i et specifikt kunde behov.

Du bliver en del af vores Patient Handling team i Gedved, der beskæftiger sig med kundesupport og udvikling af Molift og Immedia produkterne.

Dine konkrete arbejdsopgaver vil især omfatte:


Udvikling af nye produkter og div. tilbehør med tilhørende dokumentation og manualer.
Arbejde med konstruktioner i aluminium og stål samt støbte emner i både plast og metal, herunder føre dialogen direkte med underleverandører om fremstillings teknik.
Gennemføre tests af de udviklede produkter i laboratorium og/eller i marken.
Sparring med kollegaer i andre funktionsområder herunder produktion samt elektronik og software teamet.
Arbejde med/efter/mod standarder godkendelser og frembringe dokumentation hertil.
Medvirke til afdelingens faglige udvikling og sociale sammenhold
Deltage aktivt i risikovurderinger (DFMEA/PFMEA)
Diverse ad-hoc-opgaver.


Stillingen refererer direkte til R&D-chefen.

Du skal regne med en vis planlagt rejseaktivitet primært i Europa på 20 til 30 dage årligt – oftest 1-3 dages ture.

Kvalifikationer

Du har sikkert en grundlæggende uddannelse som M-ingeniør, gerne med sundhedsfaglig erfaring/baggrund, men det er ikke et krav.

Det er en krævende stilling og vi søger derfor en person med flere års praktisk erfaring fra udvikling af mekaniske produkter i en produktions- eller konsulentvirksomhed.

Det er en fordel hvis ud har erfaring med det medicinske regulativ (MDR).

Du behersker MS-Officepakken på avanceret brugerniveau med fokus på Excel.

Du har kendskab til gængse ERP-systemer og du er helt fortrolig med avanceret brug af 3D-CAD og PDM – Etac anvender SolidWorks.

Du behersker dansk på modersmålsniveau og engelsk på forhandlingsniveau i skrift og tale.

På det personlige plan bør du kunne genkende dig selv i nedenstående:


Rummer både kreative og analytiske elementer, der gør at du skaber innovative og brugbare løsninger.
Struktureret og detaljeorienteret uden at det går ud over overblikskapacitet og prioriteringerne.
Leverer løsninger til tiden i et velfungerende samarbejde med andre funktioner.
Udviklingsorienteret, pragmatisk og proaktiv.
Du er rejsevant i Europa og har en god interkulturel kompetence.
Positivt sind og godt humør gør bestemt ikke noget, og du er klar til at give en hånd og sparre med og støtte kollegaerne i deres opgaver.


Virksomheden tilbyder

Du får et afvekslende og inspirerende job i en moderne, international og hastigt voksende virksomhed med betydelige jobmæssige udfordringer og tværorganisatorisk arbejde – ofte på tværs af landegrænser.

Du vil opleve at man har de bedst tænkelige arbejdsredskaber og du møder en flok dedikerede og dygtige kolleger i et uformelt og dynamisk miljø.

Du får således en god mulighed for en solid personlig og faglig udvikling i et spændende internationalt markedssegment.

Der er højt til loftet og betydelige frihedsgrader i jobbet baseret på gensidig tillid.

Så kan du blive vores nye kollega. Vi søger lige nu en tekniker inden for elektronisk overvågning (AIA), TV-overvågning (TVO) og adgangskontrolanlæg (ADK).

Du får udfordringer og plads til at udvikle dig

Vi søger en medarbejder, der både kan indgå i sammensatte hold og arbejde selvstændigt i Danmark og i udlandet, hvor der er dansk militær repræsentation.

Du skal kunne arbejde tæt sammen med andre eksperter inden for militær sikkerhed og det er en fordel at du kendskab til eller har arbejdet med Forsvarets bestemmelser for fysisk sikkerhed, FKOBST 358-1, ”Bestemmelser for den militære sikkerhedstjeneste”.

Stillingen er meget udadvendt og du skal repræsentere Forebyggende Sikkerhed i forskellige, faglige fora. Du får en hverdag, som du i høj grad selv skal tilrettelægge, med stort ansvar og samtidig stor personlig frihed. Du får en hverdag, hvor du har en meget bred kontakt med alle dele af Forsvaret. Stillingen kan i perioder kræve en del rejseaktivitet, hvilket sker i samarbejde med sikkerhedsrådgiverne i Forebyggende Sikkerhed.

Det er vigtigt, at du kan formidle din tekniske viden gennem opsøgende rådgivningsarbejde (både i skrift og tale), at du kan undervise og at du på fleksibel vis kan gå i dialog med vores kunder, så I sammen finder løsninger, der tilgodeser de formelle krav og de muliges kunst.

Dine Vigtigste Opgaver


Gennemføre sikkerhedsrådgivning inden for elektronisk overvågning, TV-overvågning og adgangskontrolanlæg.
Gennemføre selvstændig sagsbehandling i forbindelse med kontrol af allerede eksisterende anlæg.
I samarbejde med sikkerhedsrådgiverne rådgive om elektroniske sikringsløsninger, som kan anvendes operativt af forsvarets enheder.
Deltage i planlægningen, tilrettelæggelsen og gennemførelsen af FE’s eftersyns- og inspektionsvirke.
Gennemføre kontrol og efterfølgende godkendelse af ny etableret elektroniske anlæg.
Gennemføre studievirksomhed af udviklingen og tendenser inden for området.


Du og din baggrund er vigtig


Erfaring som sikringsteknikker,
Erfaring som supporter for sikringsteknikker inden for de almen anvendte elektroniske overvågningssystemer.
Det er en fordel, men ikke et ultimativt krav at du praktisk erfaring og rådgivningserfaring med sikringsløsninger anvendt i Forsvaret, herunder kendskab til, hvordan de adskiller sig fra øvrige regelsæt.


Det er hensigtsmæssigt, at følgende uddannelse er gennemført – men ikke et ultimativt krav


DBI – Eksamineret sikringsleder


Din nye arbejdsplads

Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste (FE) er Danmarks udenrigsefterretningstjeneste og arbejder – hemmeligt og åbent – for at beskytte Danmark og danske interesser i en foranderlig verden.

Vi er ikke alene om at beskytte Danmark, men vi er den eneste myndighed, der har fået mandat til at udnytte helt særlige midler til at afdække, hvad andre stater og udenlandske aktører forsøger at holde hemmeligt. Det giver mening for os at bidrage til fred, tryghed og sikkerhed for danskerne, både i den analoge og i den digitale verden og det gør vi ved at afdække, vurdere, rådgive om og modvirke både aktuelle trusler og trusler under udvikling.

Vi værdsætter styrken i vores mangfoldighed med dybe fagligheder og specialister og vi er en helt speciel og operativt orienteret vidensorganisation, der har mange forskellige opgaver, men fælles for dem alle er det vidensgrundlag, som vores efterretningsarbejde skaber.

Ansættelsesvilkår

Du ansættes i henhold til den enhver tid gældende overenskomst. Derudover har du mulighed for at forhandle løntillæg efter kvalifikationer.

Som ansat i FE er du omfattet af nogle særlige vilkår. Det er et krav, at du kan sikkerhedsgodkendes og opretholde sikkerhedsgodkendelsen under hele din ansættelse.

Som i Forsvaret har du pligt til kortvarig udsendelse til udlandet.
