We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.

Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows


75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;


1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;

1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As an early member of our T&S Data Science and Analytics team, you will play an instrumental role in our company’s mission of building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence by building and scaling a data driven culture from the ground up. In this unique company, technology, and moment in history, your work will be critical to informing our product and commercial strategy as we deploy safe, frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with product, engineering, policy & enforcement to define and measure key company success metrics, analyze user behavior to identify new enforcement opportunities and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You’ve worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into user behavior data to provide insights on safety concerns
Define core metrics that measure the team's success. Set goals, build forecasts, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting
Identify and size opportunities to improve the product, influencing product roadmap through your insights and recommendations
Develop hypotheses on product changes, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics
Build a data driven culture from the ground up by establishing foundational data best practices and making data more accessible across the company


You May Be a Good Fit If You


8+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in an infrastructure or operations context.
5+ years of experience deeply embedding in Product teams
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI.
Expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective.
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress.
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions.
Experience in turning open questions and data into concise and insightful analysis.
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills.


Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$230,000 - $275,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Machine Learning at Stripe

Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. Key products and use-cases powered by ML at Stripe include merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization and personalization, identity verification, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies to re-imagine product experiences, and are developing AI Assistants both for our customers and to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.

Stripe handles over $1T in payments volume per year, which is roughly 1% of the world’s GDP. We process petabytes of financial data using our ML platform to build features, train models, and deploy them to production. We use a combination of highly scalable and explainable models such as linear/logistic regression and random forests, along with the latest deep neural networks from transformers to LLMs. Some of our latest innovations have been around figuring out how best to bring transformers and LLMs to improve existing models and enable entirely new product ideas that are only made possible by GenAI. Stripe’s ML models serve millions of users daily and reduce financial risk, increase payment success rate, and grow the GDP of the internet.

-------------【About the company】-------------




【Unleashing the potential of the manufacturing industry】




The company will create a society in which all people involved in manufacturing can maximize their inherent power.

To achieve this goal, they will create a ""new mechanism"" that will change the common sense of industry.




Busy with estimating and administrative tasks, lacking sales skills, and lacking information and networks.

By untying these shackles, the potential of each company can be unleashed.

From small factories in town, to large manufacturers with a long history, to start-ups in their early years, all manufacturing companies will shine by leveraging their strengths to create new value.

They will continue to take on the challenge to open up such a future.




◆Flat organization

Regardless of your position, team, previous experience, gender, age, etc., you can express your opinions and immediately incorporate what is good.

◆Excellent members

The team is made up of members who have been active in leading companies. You will have an environment where there is a growth and stimulation every day.

◆Engineer Driven

Since they are operating in a field where there are no precedents yet in the world, technical skills are extremely important, and engineers play a leading role.




--------------------------------------

◎A service that uses automated quotation technology to connect custom-orderers with processing companies.




The manufacturing industry is Japan's key industry, boasting a gross domestic product of 180 trillion yen.

In fact, about 120 trillion yen of that is accounted for by the cost of parts procurement.

Despite this large percentage, there has been no major innovation in the procurement field for over 100 years.

In particular, parts procurement for the high-mix low-volume production industry, which accounts for about one-third of the total, has been facing various social issues on both the ordering and receiving sides, such as the time and effort required for ordering and quotation, procurement costs, and the high deficit ratio on the production side.




They believed that by solving these problems, manufacturers not only in Japan but also around the world would be able to focus on higher value-added work and maximize the potential of the manufacturing industry as a whole.

So, the company developed the world's first service that uses automated quotation technology to connect custom-orderers with processing companies.

【Recruitment Background】

With the mission of “unlocking the potential of the manufacturing industry,” the company is developing the “CADDi Drawer” data platform product for the manufacturing industry.

Launched in 2022, “CADDi Drawer” enables the utilization of drawing data, which is said to be the most important data in the manufacturing industry, as an information asset by structuring it through various technologies such as machine learning and linking it with various types of information. The system is already being used by customers ranging from major domestic manufacturers to processing companies, and is growing rapidly.




In the future, the company aims to realize overall optimization that transcends divisions and companies by using technology to reproduce and consolidate manufacturing industry knowledge in addition to drawings.

In terms of development, there are many themes we would like to tackle, such as enhancing the functionality of the data platform, developing multiple new applications that run on the platform, and strengthening the infrastructure to withstand the dramatically increasing number of users and volume of data.

The company is looking for people who can work together with us to develop products that are challenging and rewarding.




【About the Organization】

Aiming to achieve both “total optimization through standardization across teams” and “ensuring discretion and speed of each team,” they have designed an organization that incorporates the concept of team topology.

20% of the development members are from overseas (Asia, Europe, North America, etc.). They are trying to create an organization in which multinational members can play an active role, for example, some teams communicate mainly in English, and important meetings are held in both Japanese and English.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

As our Data Scientist for marketing, you will be a key business partner to our Marketing team. Your work will be instrumental in shaping our data strategy as we design and implement a best-in-class Marketing motion. From exploring what successful customer accounts look like to creating sales pipeline forecasts, your insights will directly impact business decisions and strategy. Each day will bring new challenges and opportunities to drive meaningful change with data.

What You'll Achieve


You will partner with Marketing leads, driving forward all data science and analytics work in their functional areas
You will transform complex data into compelling insights, synthesizing them into crisp narratives for senior leadership that drive measurable business change (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
You will build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for critical decision-making, along with self-service tools that empower business partners
You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing marketing outreach strategies or building a marketing forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for Marketing analytics


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Marketing and GTM
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy


Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Marketing, Sales, and other GTM teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco, the estimated base salary range for this role is $140,000 - $235,000 per year.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, analyzing user behavior on a feature to identify areas of improvement, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data analysis, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Design, train, validate, and launch models for behavior cloning and reinforcement learning
Build and maintain data ingestion, labeling, and management pipelines to ensure high-quality training datasets
Build metrics to evaluate model performance in open loop, simulation, and in the real world
Collaborate with simulation, systems, and infrastructure teams to integrate ML models into real-world autonomous systems
Deploy and debug these models in real-world environments, addressing practical issues such as latency, hardware constraints, and system integration


What we’re looking for:


Practical experience applying machine learning with deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to solve real-world problems
Proficiency in Python and comfort with at least one systems language (e.g., C++, Rust)
Familiarity with recent literature and methods in learned behavior policies
Practical experience in behavior cloning and/or reinforcement learning
Bonus: Experience with diffusion policies, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, or related technologies
Bonus: Published work in conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, …


Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

We’re looking for a highly motivated engineer with experience deploying machine learning algorithms to physical systems in the real world.

The ideal candidate has hands-on experience in perception (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation) and/or behavior learning methods (e.g., Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, diffusion policies). More importantly, you’ve shipped ML models to robots in production environments, and you understand the complexities that come with it.

What you’ll do:


Develop and optimize real-time ML models for edge deployment on robotic systems
Work with vendors to label data and build robust data extraction and labeling pipelines
Design custom metrics to evaluate model performance in the field
Reduce model latency using tools like ONNX, TensorRT, or similar


What we’re looking for:


Practical experience applying machine learning with deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to solve real-world problems
Proficiency in Python and comfort with at least one systems language (e.g., C++, Rust)
Experience deploying ML models to robotic systems or other physical platforms
Experience incorporating raw sensor data like camera, lidar, radar, IMUs, etc into deep learning algorithms.
Bonus: Practical application of incorporating 3D geometry into deep learning models
Bonus: Published work in conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, We’re especially interested in engineers who thrive at the intersection of ML research and real-world robotics applications.


Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built.

Invent & prototype new ideas: turn white-board ideas into controlled experiments and live demos.
Push LLM frontiers: combine large-language models with retrieval, symbolic reasoning, or classic ML; optimize for accuracy, reliability, robustness, latency, and cost.
Measure ruthlessly: Define crisp hypotheses, select fit-for-purpose metrics (incl. human-in-the-loop), run statistically sound studies, and iterate fast.
Publish & open-source: Write high-quality papers, release evaluation suites, and present at NeurIPS/ACL/ICML—or local meet-ups if that's your style.
Seed the future: Maintain a balanced portfolio: near-term product wins, mid-term reliability projects, and ""moon-shot"" research that could 10× our differentiation.
Level-up the team: Lead paper clubs, mentor interns & junior scientists, and model best practices in reproducible science and kind collaboration.


What You'll Bring


PhD (or equivalent depth) in ML, Physics, Math, Engineering, computational linguistics, or a closely related field.
Proven research chops: First-author publications at top venues (NeurIPS, ACL, ICML, EMNLP, etc.).
LLM mastery: experience fine-tuning, prompt-engineering, and augmenting models with external knowledge/tooling.
Experimental rigor: fluent in benchmarking, statistical testing, and clear visualization of complex results.
Production-grade coding: Python + ML stacks (PyTorch/JAX), version control, and comfort reading & contributing to large codebases; bonus for database fluency (Neo4j, Postgres, MongoDB).
Storytelling skills: you can explain a log-probability trick to executives and translate product pain-points into concrete research questions.
Bonus points for: open-source maintainer experience, safety/bias evaluation expertise, or a successful track record of bridging academia and industry.

At Artisan, we’re building real AI employees - not copilots, not assistants, but autonomous teammates.

Our first, Ava, is an AI BDR. She finds and researches leads, writes emails in customers’ tone of voice, runs outbound sequences, self-optimizes, and manages email deliverability infrastructure. She learns, adapts, and improves over time - just like a human would.

Human team members use Artisan as their primary working platform, replacing a sprawling stack of sales tools, and have Artisans working alongside them.

We went through Y Combinator (W24) and have raised $35M+ from top investors. We’re at $6M+ ARR, with hundreds of customers including Remote, Quora, and SumUp.

We’re currently working on Ava 2.0, pushing the boundaries of what an AI employee can do. And we're hiring.

Artisans interact with people millions of times each month and we collect a massive amount of data. This is a unique opportunity to build self-optimization capabilities at scale:


Design and deploy systems for multivariate testing, Bayesian optimization, and online learning to optimize messaging, targeting, and sequencing
Build models that adapt on the fly, learning from user behavior to improve campaign performance in real time
Develop lead and persona scoring frameworks that help Ava decide who to reach out to, when, and how
Create models that adjust Ava’s tone, strategy, and targeting based on live campaign feedback - without human input
Work closely with Product to bake experimentation directly into Ava’s UX and decision logic


What You Bring


3–6+ years of ML experience, ideally focused on growth, recommendation engines, optimization, or adaptive systems
Experience with online experimentation frameworks (A/B testing infra, bandits, causal inference, etc)
Strong Python and data engineering skills; comfortable working across pipelines, APIs, and backend systems
Experience working with marketing funnel data is a major plus
Passion for building intelligent systems that get better every day, without human micromanagement


Why Join Us


A unique opportunity to work on the development of AI employees which will interact with 10s of millions of people
Extremely competitive compensation and full benefits
Flexibility and autonomy to run experiments and try new things
Collaborate with a mission-driven, ambitious, and extremely talented team
Fast-moving culture where you'll ship meaningful work every week

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market.

You are comfortable with Ubuntu as a development and deployment platform.
You have demonstrated strong academic performance in Computer Science, STEM or a similar degree.
You love technology and working with a diverse set of talented people.
You are curious, flexible, articulate, and accountable.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.

This is a general selection track for teams that focus on back-end REST API microservices engineering in Go and Python. It covers all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an outstanding engineer with crisp and well-articulated views on APIs, microservice design, engineering processes and DevOps.

Our services need to scale to handle millions of Ubuntu clients, and collaboration across thousands of community members. They are also central to the health of critical infrastructure across the globe. As Ubuntu has been embraced by mainstream enterprise computing through the adoption of cloud and developer-centric tech strategy, the quality of these services has become more important to customers and users.

While Ubuntu has been enormously successful and in many senses leads the industry, we think we can substantially improve our practices, quality and performance in the web services domain. We are growing our teams, and in doing so we aim to level up our insights on scalability, performance, resilience and DevOps practices.

Key areas of interest for us are:


API design, documentation, and governance
Database performance design considerations and skills
Multi-region service delivery for resilience and performance
Fuzzing and other proactive security analysis techniques
Tracing and profiling for distributed systems insights
Next-generation DevOps practices


Location: we have microservices teams with open roles in every time zone.

What your day will look like


Write high-quality, well-designed, and robust software that works at scale
Design APIs and software architecture for collegial review
Write tests that validate software behaviour
Build and maintain reliable, fault-tolerant applications and services
Collaborate proactively with a globally distributed team
Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities
Debug issues and produce high-quality solutions to resolve them
Contribute to technical documentation to make it the best of its kind
Discuss, contribute to, and collaborate across teams at Canonical
Work from home with global travel twice annually for company events


What we are looking for in you


An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path
Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations
Proficiency in Python and / or Go
History of writing modern, maintainable software
Experience with relational and non-relational database systems
Continuous integration and continuous delivery experience
Experience with systems programming or scalable web services
Professional written and spoken English
Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)
Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability
Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation
Excellent communication and presentation skills
Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments
Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each


Additional Skills That You Might Also Bring


Experience with container tech such as LXD, Docker, and Kubernetes
Understanding of build systems and toolchains
Experience with cross-compilation
Experience with hyperscale public clouds and / or private clouds
Experience with designing, building, and running distributed systems
Performance engineering and security experience


What we offer you

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.


Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
Annual compensation review
Recognition rewards
Annual holiday leave
Maternity and paternity leave
Employee Assistance Programme
Opportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues

While not a formal managerial role, the successful candidate will possess strong people skills and natural ability to lead engineers within the team, as well as working with other external teams to coordinate adoption and delivery.

We are looking for individuals with not only an incredibly deep technical background in operating system kernels and distributions, but also a strong flair for leadership and taking initiative to drive ideas and the associated delivery teams to completion.

While we hesitate to put a specific number of years of experience as a requirement for an applicant as that does not take into account relative ability or circumstances, for a comparative guideline we would be seeking candidates with the demonstrated technical equivalent of 15+ years of industry experience.

Location: We have home-based lead kernel engineer roles in every timezone, although the individual aspects as listed above may be linked to a specific geographic region.

What the role entails


Set the technical direction and lead the delivery of a team of junior and mid-career engineers for a key aspect of Ubuntu Linux
Work closely with management within and outside the team to track and coordinate initiatives to delivery
Collaborate daily with other senior technical leadership on the Kernel Team on how best to ensure Ubuntu stays at the pinnacle of Linux distributions


What we are looking for in you


Well-organised and motivated self-starter able to thrive in a remote work environment
Strong communication skills in English, both written and verbal
Expert understanding of the C programming language
Demonstrated expertise working in a *nix-based operating system kernel and distribution. While direct Linux experience would be ideal, it is not required.
Python and Bash scripting ability
Powerful grasp of the capabilities and nuances of the git version control system
Prior experience developing with software packaging formats, with direct Ubuntu/Debian/Snap experience being highly regarded
Ability to travel internationally at least twice a year for company events of up to two weeks length


Nice-to-have skills


Strong background in RTOS and real-time performance analysis
Demonstrated experience with kernel patching and debugging
Strong grasp of device drivers, BSP's, and other low level system engineering
Prior experience with Rust, ideally as it pertains to the Linux kernel


What we offer colleagues

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.


Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
Annual compensation review
Recognition rewards
Annual holiday leave
Maternity and paternity leave
Team Member Assistance Program & Wellness Platform
Opportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues
Priority Pass and travel upgrades for long-haul company events

Scaling distributed training jobs to thousands of GPUs
Designing fault tolerance strategies for our training infrastructure
Creating interactive visualizations of model internals, such as attention patterns


At Anthropic, we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. We strongly encourage applications from candidates of all backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups in tech.

If you're excited about pushing the boundaries of AI while prioritizing safety and ethics, we want to hear from you!

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$340,000 - $425,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.<br><br>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

Company Summary: Cellarity’s mission is to fundamentally redesign the way drugs are created for the sake of bringing new hope to patients. By shifting the focus from a single target to the underlying cellular dysfunction, we unravel the complexity of disease biology and create medicines that were never before possible. The company has developed unique capabilities that link biology and chemistry with high dimensional -omic data from which we design medicines against the cellular signature of disease. The Cellarity platform allows us to uncover new biology in diseases even in the absence of known causal targets. Cellarity is a privately held, clinical-phase drug discovery startup using AI and single-cell omics to develop life-changing medicines that are unreachable by traditional methods of drug discovery. Cellarity is a product of Flagship Pioneering's venture creation engine, which has conceived and created companies such as Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA), Generate: Biomedicines, and Lila Sciences.

Cellarity is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

Recruitment & Staffing Agencies: Cellarity does not accept unsolicited resumes from any source other than candidates. The submission of unsolicited resumes by recruitment or staffing agencies to Cellarity or its employees is strictly prohibited unless contacted directly by Cellarity’s internal Talent Acquisition team.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
