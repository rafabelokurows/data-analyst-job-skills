About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics. The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

About us:

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved.

With over 30 million automated calls handled, 4 million hours saved in contact centres, and 99.9% uptime, their no-code platform is powering the future of voice AI.




Backed by the investors behind Facebook and GroupOn and trusted by 1,000+ companies, they enable enterprises to deploy multilingual, human-like voice agents at scale.




Role Overview:




The ML Engineer will join the founding team, shaping real-time, low-latency speech systems from the ground up. This is a hands-on, architecture-level role - building end-to-end voice pipelines that combine ASR, LLMs, and TTS, and scaling them across mission-critical environments.




Key Responsibilities:




Design and deploy real-time ASR → LLM → TTS pipelines optimised for speed and naturalness
Fine-tune and integrate best-in-class open-source and commercial models across ASR, TTS, and LLMs
Optimise inference performance using techniques like quantisation, distillation, and RL-based tuning
Build high-throughput, low-latency APIs using Python, FastAPI, gRPC, and WebSocket streaming
Own deployment workflows across cloud and on-prem, collaborating on Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD
Stay ahead of the curve — run experiments, track new research, and help keep the team at the cutting edge




Qualifications:




Deep experience in Python.
Proven hands-on work with real-time ASR, TTS, voice chat, or streaming audio systems
Familiarity with LLM tooling - prompt design, fine-tuning, RAG, and frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or OpenPipe




You’ll push the boundaries of what voice AI can do in production - balancing model quality, latency, and scalability - while working across product, infra, and research to ship new capabilities into the hands of real users.




If you want to build the voice layer of enterprise AI - and work at the frontier of real-time language, speech, and systems - we’d love to hear from you.

The system would detect colorimetric images and predict with a high level of accuracy discrete pH values, delivering lab-quality diagnostic precision to women and doctors - anytime, anywhere!


Tasks


To make pHera robust and scalable, pHera is looking for a computer vision and machine learning engineer to design and implement the complete computer-vision pipeline: from image capture, colour detection and pH prediction.





Implement computer vision algorithms for color detection from captured images


Integrate machine learning models for accurate pH prediction based colour detection


Ensure performance across different smartphone devices and lighting conditions





Applicants who clearly outline in thier cover letter how they would implement these three tasks will be prioritised.


Requirements



Based in Berlin


Eager to work in an early-stage, science-driven, female health startup


Comfortable with ambiguity, self-directed, and proactive



Benefits


Flexibility: choose freelance, part-time or full-time




Hybrid work environment with office space in Berlin




A competitive salary for 6 months with the possibility of extension




pHera is closing the gender health gap!

Most existing vaginal pH test strips are analog, low-resolution, visually subjective, and

poorly suited for women’s health applications. Doctors need fast, reliable tools to

help with complicated diagnoses. Women deserve clarity, not guesswork when

managing their vaginal health from home. A high-resolution pH test can catch

imbalances early, making it easier to monitor issues like bacterial vaginosis,

recurring vaginal infections, sexually transmitted infections, ovulation, PCOS, and

menopause. By building pHera, you would be building a tool that would advance women's health.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

You would be joining a flexible and dynamic team and your role will include:


selecting features, building and optimizing classifiers using machine learning techniques
processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
deep dive on the problems using SQL and scripting languages to drive solutions leveraging Statistical Analysis
implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone. Our recruitment process is free from discrimination of any kind — including on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

With over 25 employees from more than 15 different countries, our diversity drives innovation, enriches our culture, and challenges us to consider multiple perspectives every day.

5+ years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or a related quantitative role.

Company Description

ARGO is building the fastest AI engine to understand small companies (SME) across the UK & US. This will improve how SMEs access financial services. SMEs are the engine of any economy, we need to do better for them to thrive.

The company was started by serial entrepreneurs with a strong track record. We have an office in Shoreditch and are backed by prominent venture capital firms from the US & Europe.

This is an AI startup that is heavy on Data, ML Algorithms + LLMs.

Role Description

This is a full-time hybrid role for a Senior Engineer (ML Engineer):


Strong background in Pattern Recognition, Computer Science, and Statistics
Expertise in LLMs and Algorithms
Experience with data preprocessing and feature extraction
Proficiency in programming languages like Python or R (4+ years)
Knowledge of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch
Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills
What you don't know, we can teach - as long as you have the desire to learn.
We are a group of serious engineers, and looking to add a few more who have experience with Python, Machine learning, data pipelines and scalable infrastructure (we are mostly on AWS)
This is a startup, so being able to sit across a few areas is always appreciated. You are going to be treated like a member of the Founding team and get to participate in key decisions.
We will be filing patents for some of our work, and you can be involved should you be interested in being named on a patent.


Other Details

The company is ~12 people, we are now looking to bring on 3 more Engineers who can build this further. We are live in the market serving customers and earning revenue.

Our work spans across Data, Machine Learning and intelligent use of LLMs to enable us to reach the capability of human underwriters. This is a big challenge that will take us a few years to reach, but we have a strong headstart given the founding team's prior experiences within this field. And the impact on any economy is significant as SMEs often employ over half the population.

Backed by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, the IPA, and Sky, Barb has been the source of official TV viewing figures for decades. 




Barb is uniquely placed to empower transformation of the UK TV and advertising ecosystem through reliable and accurate data.  




These data fulfil three purposes:  




To support decisions that are made in the making and distribution of great programmes.  
To support the planning and buying of ad campaigns and informing on brand and sales outcomes.  
To inform how broadcasters and other media services operate in the public interest. 




As the media industry evolves, so does Barb. We've expanded our measurement beyond traditional panels to incorporate large-scale online data and streaming services. Through our campaign reporting tools, Barb also provides the full picture of cross-platform pre and post campaign reporting. 




Our hybrid approach combines people-based panel data with census-level device data to deliver inclusive measurement of total identified viewing across all platforms, services, and devices. This empowers broadcasters, advertisers, and regulators to make more better, fairer, more informed decisions. 




Overview 

We’re seeking a Junior Data Scientist to help build the future of UK audience measurement. This is a unique opportunity to join a small, expert team of 13, reporting directly to the Head of Data Science and working on foundational systems used by major media organisations across the UK. 




You can expect to work on high-impact projects including: 




The Barb Data Hub, a centralised Snowflake data warehouse serving as the single source of truth for Barb data. You’ll help develop a library of reusable analysis tools. 
Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Sharing – ensuring users can apply Barb’s complex methodologies efficiently and accurately. 
Barb Panel Plus, a new system integrating “return path data” from TV sets and set-top boxes with existing panel data. 




These projects pose exciting challenges from the point of view of data engineering, statistical modelling, and software development. This role will be of interest to someone starting their career as a data scientist and excited by the prospect of finding brilliant solutions to these problems. The role would be well-suited to someone who is a talented coder, logical thinker, enjoys working with data, has an interest in the TV industry, and is looking to grow into their career as a data scientist. 




Key responsibilities 




Work closely with the Barb executive team and partners to understand and implement the Barb Calculation Methodology, which is a complex set of conventions and algorithms that describe how to use Barb panel data to calculate standard audience metrics. 
Build and maintain a shared library of reusable data analysis tools for Barb’s users and suppliers. 
Support users of Barb’s API and Direct Cloud Share, ensuring they produce correct and industry-standard outputs. 
Translate parts of the methodology into reliable, production-ready Python code for use across Barb’s systems. 
Contribute to the evaluation and development of statistical and machine learning models for return path data integration. 
Develop ELT pipelines and modelling solutions for data integration projects. 

 




Qualifications 




A degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., STEM, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics). 
Good working knowledge of Python and SQL. 
Experience with Python data packages (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) preferred. 
Strong mathematical and statistical foundation. 
Ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with others. 

 

Experience 




The ideal candidate will have some experience with: 

Data engineering; working with databases, building infrastructure for moving, storing, and processing data.  
Modelling; analysing data using statistical or machine-learning techniques 




Preferred: 

Experience with Snowflake, or other cloud data platforms such as Databricks or BigQuery. 
Familiarity with Snowpark or similar distributed computing frameworks such as Spark. 

For graduates, the above could include projects done at university or during an internship. 




 




Benefits 




Base salary will reflect the responsibilities of the role and be commensurate with experience. Barb offers a discretionary bonus scheme alongside the following benefits. 




Office in central London – with hybrid working options 
Pension contributions up to a maximum of 9% of salary — employees’ contribution matched +3% 
Five weeks paid holiday — rising to six weeks after 10 years’ service 
Holiday purchase scheme — purchase up to five additional days in any calendar year

Founded in 2017 by a former Worldpay CTO, Yaspa uses open banking to provide instant bank payments that are faster, more secure and more cost-effective than cards, and to help regulated businesses seamlessly verify customers and their payments. Yaspa operates across the UK and Europe, is regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, and is backed by leading investors including Fin Capital, SGH Capital & Metavallon VC.




Yaspa has recently secured a $12 million (£9m) investment led by Discerning Capital with participation from longstanding Yaspa investor Techstars Ventures. This milestone funding will accelerate our expansion into the US market as we continue to transform payments and identity services for regulated businesses.




The role

We are seeking a skilled data scientist to contribute to our new Customer Risk and Customer Health Check platform, powered by open banking. Your role will involve developing a Machine Learning product that analyzes customers' transactional data (provided with their consent) to generate insights based on their spending patterns. These insights will be applied across sectors like loans for risk management and IGaming for managing customer spending behaviors. You will play a crucial role in our transition from a payment-focused business to one that leverages AI and machine learning to better understand our customers.




We’re looking for data scientists with a strong grasp of Machine Learning who thrive in a fast-paced, agile environment and can help expand Yaspa's AI capabilities. You’ll join a close-knit, multidisciplinary team that includes frontend, backend, and full-stack developers, release engineers, and testers, with direct reporting to the CTO. Experience in the following areas is a plus: finance, open banking, iGaming, startups, or enterprise companies dealing with real-time processing.




Responsibilities

You will use Python, with a strong grounding in feature engineering, model evaluation, and inference pipelines to help shape the future of our product offerings

Act as a subject matter expert in Analytics: Strong understanding of statistics, experimental design, and hypothesis testing to identify trends and patterns, and develop predictive models
Design intuitive visualisations to communicate findings and insights to clients, technical and non-technical stakeholders
Lead model deployment with an eye for performance, scalability, and real time low-latency inference




Other points you’ll support on:

Bring experience or gain knowledge to act as a subject matter expert in open banking, payment networks (ACH, RTP), and real-time risk infrastructure is a strong plus.
Bring experience or gain knowledge to act as a subject matter expert in designing and deploying real-time risk models, ideally in the context of A2A payments or other financial transaction systems is a strong plus.
Bring experience or gain knowledge to act as a subject matter expert in fraud detection, creditworthiness assessment, and optimising transaction approval rates using advanced DS/ML techniques is a strong plus.




Experience

Required skills

Hands-on experience building and deploying ML models in Python
SQL skills and familiarity with AWS for deployment and data workflows.
Strong knowledge of statistical modelling, anomaly detection, clustering, and supervised/unsupervised learning
Experience working with large-scale data
Proven success collaborating with product and engineering teams to ship ML-based features and tools
Strong communication skills and business acumen to present complex technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders
Curious, proactive, and comfortable working in ambiguity in a scaling startup environment
Proficiency with data visualisation tools such as Tableau, PowerBI
Degree with 5+ years of relevant experience, OR equivalent




Nice to Have

Demonstrated ability to design and validate features using transactional and behavioral data from financial services
Proven track record in payment risk, fraud detection, or credit decisioning is strongly preferred
Experience with model governance and monitoring in regulated environments
Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), preferably AWS, ML tools such as the AWS suite: Sagemaker

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)

Rattaché(e) à la Responsable de Production Conditionnement et en lien étroit avec les chefs d'ateliers que vous encadrez, vous êtes garant(e) du bon déroulement des opérations de conditionnement de notre gamme traiteur (lasagnes, parmentiers...), de la qualité des produits finis, ainsi que de la sécurité des équipes.
Votre mission : coordonner les activités de production dans le respect des objectifs fixés et des normes QHSE, tout en insufflant une véritable dynamique d'amélioration continue.

Au quotidien, vos principales responsabilités sont les suivantes :

Description de l'emploi

Night Crew Member

We are more than just your local restaurant. We are a collection of hardworking small-business owners.

Did you know that from coast to coast, we serve delicious choices to more than 2.5 million people in over 1,400 locations every day, or that we have proudly helped more than 387,000 Canadian families with sick children through Ronald McDonald House Charities?

Our offer

Working With Us Means That You Will Have The Opportunity To Earn And Learn, Flexibility, And a Safe And Inclusive Work Environment. What This Means In Practice Is


Access to education and skills development opportunities that take you further
A total rewards package that includes discounts, incentives, and recognition perks
Flexible hours/shifts that suit your needs
A safe, respectful and inclusive workplace
Bring your authentic self to work - welcoming people of every age, background, and culture - just like the guests who visit our restaurants every day


The job

About

We are sure that you have an idea about what working with us is like, but just in case here are some of the highlights on what your job as a Night Crew will entail:


Greeting guests, taking orders and processing payments
Preparing food and drinks
Managing delivery and mobile orders
Assembling orders and packaging take-out and delivery
Keeping all surfaces clean and sanitary to ensure the safety for our guests, fellow crew members, and yourself


Whether you are working in the kitchen, at the Drive-Thru, or at the front counter you are a part of a dynamic team that works together to deliver an exceptional guest experience.

Your Vibe And Experience

While previous experience working in food service or retail as a barista, server, sales associate, cashier, team member, or customer sales representative is always helpful and appreciated, what is most important is who you are.

You are a night owl, love the nightlife, and have boundless energy. You are trustworthy and have trust in others. You find joy in the details and believe good quality is what keeps guests coming back. You remain cool, calm and collected in a fast-paced environment. You understand there is no ""I"" in team and thrive in social situations. You’re always willing to learn and grow. You get that service isn’t a transaction, it’s about connection. That a smile can make all the difference in someone’s day. It’s genuine, and it’s who you are.

About Us

In 1954, an enterprising salesman named Ray Kroc discovered a small burger restaurant in California, and wrote the first page of McDonald’s history. In 1967, the first McDonald’s Canada opened in Richmond, B.C. and we’ve been growing with our communities and serving quality food at great a value ever since. Today, McDonald’s Canada is proud to be one of the world’s leading foodservice retailers, offering job opportunities at corporate-owned restaurants or restaurants owned by independent franchisees.

McDonald’s Canada and Owner/Operators are committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace for all. Our workplaces have a long-standing policy of providing fair, equitable, and accessible opportunities for all employees and prospective employees. Accommodations during the application process are available upon request.

We help marketing and sales teams overcome disruptive data and technology fragmentation, injecting Account Intelligence into every step of the buyer journey. We empower clients to orchestrate actions seamlessly across advertising, account-based experiences, and sales motions allowing them to spot opportunities earlier, engage intelligently, and close deals faster.

We are deeply committed to employee growth, innovation, and diversity. With offices in San Francisco Bay Area, New York, Seattle, and teams in the UK and India, Demandbase fosters an inclusive environment, recognized consistently as one of the best workplaces.

About the Role

As a Senior ML Engineer at Demandbase, you’ll play a strategic role in building cutting-edge, production-level machine learning systems that drive deep technographic intelligence and high-impact business decisions. This role goes beyond conventional ML development—you will architect and scale LLM-powered solutions that detect, classify, and map technographic signals from diverse sources (e.g., LinkedIn, SSL certs, blogs, and subdomains) to Demandbase’s structured product catalog.

You’ll apply a combination of traditional ML, deep learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., LLaMA-3, Gemma, Mistral, GPT) to transform unstructured signals into actionable intelligence—pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in entity resolution, product discovery, and dynamic catalog enrichment.







Responsibilities

1. Machine Learning & LLM Development

Build scalable, production-ready ML + LLM hybrid systems for:
Technographic signal extraction
Entity resolution from noisy data (e.g., LinkedIn job descriptions, SSL certs)
Product and category mapping via instruction-tuned LLMs and vector DBs
Use foundation models like LLaMA and Gemma for deep contextual understanding, enabling semantic inference of products, categories, and subcategories.
Leverage RAG pipelines and prompt engineering to improve product detection and catalog alignment with minimal labeled data.

2. End-to-End Solution Ownership

Translate complex, ambiguous business needs into ML and LLM solution frameworks.
Lead the model lifecycle—from data ingestion, feature design, model development (ML/LLM), fine-tuning, to deployment and monitoring.
Implement human-in-the-loop systems and catalog-aware feedback loops for continuous catalog enrichment and model refinement.

3. Experimentation & Optimization

Conduct multi-modal experiments using traditional ML and transformer-based LLMs for hybrid architectures.
Optimize model performance using best-in-class techniques for:
Few-shot and zero-shot learning
Approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)
LLM-based reranking and metadata generation
Automate categorization of unknown/new tools (e.g., “Turso”, “Appsmith”) using LLM-based generalization and taxonomy mapping.

4. MLOps & Infrastructure

Ensure robust production-grade model deployment using tools like:
Ray, Dask, Deepspeed (for scalable inference)
MLflow, Airflow, Feast, Kubeflow (for lifecycle management and monitoring)
Vector DBs (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate) for embedding-based matching
Integrate LLM-based services into high-throughput pipelines, ensuring low latency, scalability, and fault tolerance.

5. Innovation & Research

Stay up to date with LLM advancements and experiment with new architectures (e.g., RAG, LLM agents, toolformer models).
Contribute to Demandbase’s AI strategy by identifying opportunities where LLMs can create product and customer impact.
Prototype and evangelize usage of LLM-based reasoning and categorization across product teams.

6. Team Mentorship & Collaboration

Guide and mentor junior ML engineers and data scientists on LLM-centric design patterns, fine-tuning strategies, and deployment frameworks.
Foster collaboration with product, engineering, and analytics to deliver unified, data-driven solutions.

We value our relationship with our clients and believe that our deployment of dedicated, Dublin-based project and asset management teams give us a competitive advantage over other competitors who operate a shared services model across their portfolios.

We’re inclusive and encourage our colleagues to be themselves. Our culture supports the difference that makes each of us unique. We’re open and eager to embrace new ways of working and have a diverse community, enriched by our local identities that works collaboratively to build a unified and dynamic organisation.

We believe that a supported flexible working approach helps us to retain valued colleagues, enhance wellbeing, increase motivation and encourage a healthy work/life balance. If you’re interviewed, ask about the flexibility involved in this role.

Our values are- we succeed together; we do the right thing; we’re trusted and valued; and we’re brave and creative. You’ll hear more about these throughout the interview process.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

How You Will Make An Impact


Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency


Preferred Experience


Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python


Who You Are


You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence

Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross-border trade.

Our beliefs are the foundation for how we conduct business every day. We live each day guided by our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness.

Job Summary

The Division of Neurology is seeking a qualified and motivated Data Scientist to support quality improvement and operational efficiency through the analysis of health data. This position involves the extraction, collation, and interpretation of clinical and administrative data from electronic health records and other health information systems. The successful candidate will play a key role in identifying trends related to consultation volume, inpatient admissions, billing practices, and resident workload, and will contribute to data-driven decision-making across the division.

Organizational Status

This position reports to the Head of the UBC Division of Neurology and will work under their direction.

The incumbent will collaborate with faculty members, residents, fellows, and administrative staff within Neurology, the Department of Medicine (DoM), the Faculty of Medicine (FoM), and university service units such as Digital Solutions.

Participate in the preparation of written and oral presentations that summarize the data analysis results, interpret findings and provide conclusions and recommendations


Consequence of Error/Judgement

This role requires a high degree of accuracy, integrity, and sound judgment. Errors in data extraction, analysis, or interpretation could lead to misinformed decisions by clinical and administrative leadership, potentially affecting patient care delivery, resource allocation, and the well-being of medical trainees.

The incumbent must be able to handle confidential data responsibly and exercise discretion when dealing with sensitive or politically nuanced information.

Supervision Received

Directly under the supervision of Division Head and/or Associate Heads.

Supervision Given

Your models don't just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you, read on.

AlgaeCal is on the hunt for an Intermediate Data Scientist to develop mathematical algorithms and apply machine learning to analyze business data, test hypotheses, and turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.

This job will give you ALL the feels:

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world's only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you'll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.

This job might be for you if you've got...


2+ years experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You've built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don't just analyze numbers, you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You've used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that'll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis
Kaggle-level knowledge of artificial intelligence models. And if you think RAG is something you clean your countertops with, this probably isn't the role for you.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it's regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don't just apply models, you understand how they work under the hood
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You've worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You're the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don't just crunch numbers, you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You're proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability
Industry know-how that adds value. If you've got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that's a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Startup Co-Founder Track


Partner with a business-oriented co-founder to launch a new AI-native company
Own all technical architecture, infrastructure, and implementation decisions
Build from zero to one, MVP, iterations, integrations, and full-stack deployment
Create defensibility through smart use of AI, automation, and infrastructure
Potentially earn significant equity and long-term ownership in a venture


🧠 What You Bring


Strong experience with LLMs (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, open-source models) and prompt engineering
Experience building and maintaining production-grade AI systems
Proficiency in Python, JS/TS, or similar, with the ability to build and deploy full workflows
Familiarity with APIs, webhooks, vector databases, and automation platforms (Zapier, LangChain, etc.)
Ability to work independently, switch contexts, and move quickly without much oversight
Clear technical communication and systematic thinking


Preferred Qualifications


Experience in startup environments, AI tooling, or no-code/low-code stack integrations
Prior experience launching AI-powered products or tools
Familiarity with frameworks like Lang Graph, Pinecone, LlamaIndex, or RAG architectures
Strong intuition for product and user experience


💡 You're a Great Fit If You…


Ship real tools, not just demos
Can own an entire product or subsystem on your own
Love solving messy problems with clean code and smart automations
Thrive in ambiguity, move fast, and never wait to be told what to do
Are open to both career tracks: operator or co-founder
Are hungry for more than a job, you want a mission

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.




About the Role:




We're seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to bridge the gap between our data products, data science insights and production systems. You'll be responsible for taking ML models from concept to production, building robust MLOps infrastructure, and ensuring our machine learning systems operate reliably at scale. This role focuses on the engineering aspects of ML design, deployment, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure.




What you will do:




Design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion to model serving
Build automated model training, validation, and deployment workflows using CI/CD best practices
Develop and maintain MLOps infrastructure for model versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment
Create robust monitoring and alerting systems for model performance, data drift, and system health
Optimize model inference performance and cost for production workloads
Collaborate with our Data Engineers to design and implement feature stores and feature pipelines
Develop automated data quality checks and validation frameworks for ML pipelines
Build scalable feature engineering workflows that support both batch and real-time inference
Implement data versioning and lineage tracking for reproducible ML workflows
Partner with Software Data Scientists to productionize research models and experiments
Implement frameworks for model evaluation and gradual rollouts
Design automated retraining pipelines and model refresh strategies
Establish best practices for model governance, documentation, and compliance
Work closely with Software Engineers to integrate ML capabilities into existing applications
Contribute to architectural decisions for scalable, maintainable ML systems
Participate in code reviews, documentation, and knowledge sharing across teams
Mentor junior engineers on ML engineering best practices




The right person for this role will have:




3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, MLOps, or related fields
Strong proficiency in Python for ML development and automation
Solid SQL skills for data manipulation and analysis
Hands-on experience with AWS or other cloud platforms (Azure, or GCP) and their ML services
Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for ML workloads
Proficiency with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and MLOps tools
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code principles
Databricks experience is a plus
Experience with feature engineering at scale and feature store implementations
Understanding of model monitoring, observability, and production ML challenges
Knowledge of data quality frameworks and automated testing for ML systems
Familiarity with distributed computing frameworks (Databricks or Sagemaker) for large-scale ML
Experience with experiment tracking and model versioning tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases, etc.)




Bonus points if you have:




Master's or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or related quantitative field Experience with real-time ML inference and streaming data pipelines
Knowledge of AutoML platforms and automated hyperparameter tuning
Familiarity with model compression, quantization, and edge deployment Experience with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud ML architectures
Contributions to open-source ML tools or platforms




Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
4 weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 days of the year




Application process:

Please submit your resume highlighting relevant experience and include a cover letter explaining your interest in the specific role
Provide links to relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or publications
Be prepared to discuss technical projects and problem-solving approaches in interviews
