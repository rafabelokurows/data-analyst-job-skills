We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing marketing outreach strategies or building a marketing forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for Marketing analytics


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Marketing and GTM
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don't exist yet
You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy

We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, analyzing user behavior on a feature to identify areas of improvement, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data analysis, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on behavior learning, specifically data-driven behavior policies and robust data infrastructure. In this role, you'll be responsible for developing and scaling state-of-the-art learning architectures, while also building the data systems that make these models reliable, scalable, and reproducible in production.

What you’ll do:


Design, train, validate, and launch models for behavior cloning and reinforcement learning
Build and maintain data ingestion, labeling, and management pipelines to ensure high-quality training datasets
Build metrics to evaluate model performance in open loop, simulation, and in the real world
Collaborate with simulation, systems, and infrastructure teams to integrate ML models into real-world autonomous systems
Deploy and debug these models in real-world environments, addressing practical issues such as latency, hardware constraints, and system integration


What we’re looking for:


Practical experience applying machine learning with deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to solve real-world problems
Proficiency in Python and comfort with at least one systems language (e.g., C++, Rust)
Familiarity with recent literature and methods in learned behavior policies
Practical experience in behavior cloning and/or reinforcement learning
Bonus: Experience with diffusion policies, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, or related technologies
Bonus: Published work in conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, …


Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

We’re looking for a highly motivated engineer with experience deploying machine learning algorithms to physical systems in the real world.

The ideal candidate has hands-on experience in perception (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation) and/or behavior learning methods (e.g., Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, diffusion policies). More importantly, you’ve shipped ML models to robots in production environments, and you understand the complexities that come with it.

What you’ll do:


Develop and optimize real-time ML models for edge deployment on robotic systems
Work with vendors to label data and build robust data extraction and labeling pipelines
Design custom metrics to evaluate model performance in the field
Reduce model latency using tools like ONNX, TensorRT, or similar


What we’re looking for:


Practical experience applying machine learning with deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to solve real-world problems
Proficiency in Python and comfort with at least one systems language (e.g., C++, Rust)
Experience deploying ML models to robotic systems or other physical platforms
Experience incorporating raw sensor data like camera, lidar, radar, IMUs, etc into deep learning algorithms.
Bonus: Practical application of incorporating 3D geometry into deep learning models
Bonus: Published work in conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, We’re especially interested in engineers who thrive at the intersection of ML research and real-world robotics applications.


Our roles are often flexible. If you don't fit all the criteria, or are in another location (especially one where we have an office like SF of NY) please apply anyway! We'd love to consider you.

Join the team bringing advanced autonomy to the built world

At Bedrock, we've assembled one of the most experienced autonomous technology teams in the industry, with deep expertise scaling breakthroughs across transportation, infrastructure, and enterprise software. Our leaders helped put the first self-driving cars on public roads at Waymo, scaled systems for Segment's $3.2B acquisition, and grew Uber Freight to $5B in revenue.

While others debate the future of AI, we're deploying it in the real world. Our systems are already installed on heavy machines across the country, learning on real construction sites and working to reshape the earth with survey-grade precision and exceptional safety. This isn't a simulation—it's autonomous intelligence working on billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

In just over a year, we've raised $80M, put our equipment into the field, and established partnerships with forward-thinking contractors who are integrating our technology into their operations. We're working quickly to close the gap between America's surging demand for housing, data centers, manufacturing hubs, and the construction industry's growing labor shortage.

Here, algorithms meet steel-toed boots. You'll collaborate with both construction veterans and experienced engineers, tackling problems where your work directly impacts how the physical world get built. If you're interested in applying cutting-edge technology to solve meaningful problems alongside a talented team—we'd love to have you join us.

At Artisan, we’re building real AI employees - not copilots, not assistants, but autonomous teammates.

Our first, Ava, is an AI BDR. She finds and researches leads, writes emails in customers’ tone of voice, runs outbound sequences, self-optimizes, and manages email deliverability infrastructure. She learns, adapts, and improves over time - just like a human would.

Human team members use Artisan as their primary working platform, replacing a sprawling stack of sales tools, and have Artisans working alongside them.

We went through Y Combinator (W24) and have raised $35M+ from top investors. We’re at $6M+ ARR, with hundreds of customers including Remote, Quora, and SumUp.

We’re currently working on Ava 2.0, pushing the boundaries of what an AI employee can do. And we're hiring.

About The Role

Artisans interact with people millions of times each month and we collect a massive amount of data. This is a unique opportunity to build self-optimization capabilities at scale:


Design and deploy systems for multivariate testing, Bayesian optimization, and online learning to optimize messaging, targeting, and sequencing
Build models that adapt on the fly, learning from user behavior to improve campaign performance in real time
Develop lead and persona scoring frameworks that help Ava decide who to reach out to, when, and how
Create models that adjust Ava’s tone, strategy, and targeting based on live campaign feedback - without human input
Work closely with Product to bake experimentation directly into Ava’s UX and decision logic


What You Bring


3–6+ years of ML experience, ideally focused on growth, recommendation engines, optimization, or adaptive systems
Experience with online experimentation frameworks (A/B testing infra, bandits, causal inference, etc)
Strong Python and data engineering skills; comfortable working across pipelines, APIs, and backend systems
Experience working with marketing funnel data is a major plus
Passion for building intelligent systems that get better every day, without human micromanagement


Why Join Us


A unique opportunity to work on the development of AI employees which will interact with 10s of millions of people
Extremely competitive compensation and full benefits
Flexibility and autonomy to run experiments and try new things
Collaborate with a mission-driven, ambitious, and extremely talented team
Fast-moving culture where you'll ship meaningful work every week

At Artisan, we're creating AI Employees, called Artisans, and software which is sleek, easy to use, and replaces the endless stack of point solutions. We're starting with outbound sales and our AI BDR, Ava. Our platform contains every tool needed for outbound sales - B2B data, AI email sequences, deliverability optimization tools and so much more.

We're growing very rapidly and recently raised a $25M Series A round from top investors. We are looking for superstars to join us on our rocketship growth as we relentlessly work towards building a multi-billion dollar company.

About The Role

We're not just shipping AI products—we're building ones that learn and improve autonomously. We’re looking for a Growth ML & Experimentation Engineer to build Ava’s adaptive growth brain: systems that run millions of microtests and optimize outbound performance across companies, personas, and industries.

Think of this role as creating the “growth hacker” mind inside our AI BDR—combining A/B testing, reinforcement learning, and control systems at scale.

You’ll be building an AI that adapts itself to every persona, every market, and every trend—without needing to be told. This isn’t growth hacking for a website. It’s evolution for an AI employee.

What You'll Do


Design and implement automated experimentation systems (A/Z testing, multivariate optimization, Bayesian exploration, etc).
Build dynamic systems that continuously learn from open/response rates, meetings booked, and downstream metrics.
Create reinforcement loops and scoring models to help Ava adjust tone, targeting, and strategies in real-time.
Work closely with product to embed experimentation directly into the AI-user experience.
Develop tools to visualize and interpret campaign intelligence for internal teams and end users.


What You Bring


3–6+ years of experience in applied ML, ideally focused on growth, optimization, or adaptive systems.
Experience with online experimentation frameworks (A/B testing infra, bandits, causal inference, etc).
Strong Python and data engineering skills; comfortable working across pipelines, APIs, and backend systems.

Passion for building intelligent systems that get better every day, without human micromanagement.


Why Join Us


Build the future of work by pioneering a new AI-native product category.
Collaborate with a mission-driven, ambitious, and high-caliber team.
Competitive salary, generous equity, and full benefits.
Regular company off-sites and team events.
Fast-moving culture where you'll ship meaningful work every week.

Solid understanding of PostgreSQL and data modeling best practices
Familiarity with API frameworks such as FastAPI or Flask
Experience in deploying and managing machine learning pipelines in production environments
Comfortable working independently and taking initiative in fast-paced, ambiguous settings
Strong communication skills (in English) and ability to collaborate across teams




Bonus points for:

Familiarity with containerization, Docker, CI/CD, or cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What We Offer

A rare opportunity to build core systems at the heart of a high-impact product
A collaborative, high-performance culture led by experienced founders
Competitive compensation with potential equity upside
Flexible working hours and remote-friendly setup
Clear growth path toward technical leadership as the team expands

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Let’s build a smarter, more sustainable supply chain — together.

Nutrium is a health tech company transforming how people engage with nutrition on a global scale. For years, we’ve improved the experience of nutrition professionals and patients with today’s #1 nutrition counseling platform. But we didn’t stop there.

Today, our mission extends further. With Nutrium Care, we aim to make real nutrition accessible to everyone - promoting healthier and happier lives.

Our journey is fueled by core values that guide every decision we make. We believe that everyone can make an impact, regardless of their job title or experience. We embrace continuous improvement, experiment with new ideas, and learn from both successes and mistakes. We value teamwork and collaboration in pursuit of shared goals, and above all, we strive for excellence.

👏 The Team

We are a motivated, young, and entrepreneurial team, driven by the excitement of building something meaningful.

At Nutrium, we value creativity, communication, agility, and being provocatively kind - sometimes the best way to help is by challenging others with empathy. While expertise is important, what truly sets us apart is our willingness to embrace challenges that others might avoid.

About the role:

At Nutrium, we’re on a mission to improve lives through personalized nutrition. As Senior Research Scientist, you’ll play a pivotal role in shaping and driving our strategy for creating robust clinical evidence that demonstrates the impact of Nutrium on people’s health and well-being.

You’ll be focused on designing and executing high-quality research studies — including randomized controlled trials — to prove the efficacy of Nutrium’s solutions. You’ll spearhead projects in nutritional health while also contributing to day-to-day activities such as data analysis, manuscript writing, and the clear communication of scientific evidence to our customers, partners, and the broader community.

If you’re passionate about nutrition, health tech, and preventive care — and ready to grow in a dynamic, fast-moving team — we’d love to hear from you!

Are you ready?

Key responsibilities:


Define and lead Nutrium’s clinical research strategy in alignment with our mission and business goals;
Design and coordinate research studies (e.g., RCTs, cross-sectional surveys, pre-post studies) on topics such as nutrition, metabolic health, and workplace interventions;
Manage clinical projects from planning to reporting, in collaboration with internal teams and external research partners;
Analyze large datasets, perform statistical analysis, and report findings (e.g., white papers, return on investment reports, case studies…);
Write scientific articles for peer-reviewed journals and create presentations for internal and external audiences;
Build partnerships with universities, institutions, insurers, and domain experts;
Conduct rigorous literature reviews and create scientific content to support product, clinical, and marketing teams;
Oversee translation and localization of research materials for international markets.



Who you are:


PhD or Postdoc in Public Health, Epidemiology, Behavioural Science, or related fields (focus on Nutritional Health is a strong plus);
5+ years of experience leading research studies or clinical trials, ideally in Health Tech, MedTech, or fast-paced environments;
Skilled in designing and delivering research projects in collaboration with B2B partners;
Solid knowledge of clinical trial processes, documentation, and regulatory principles;
Comfortable working with nutritional interventions and evaluating outcomes like dietary change, quality of life, or productivity;
Strong data analysis skills using Python or R (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, StatsModels, Matplotlib, etc.);
Familiar with tools like Excel, SPSS, and CTMS, or document management systems;
Proven track record of publications in peer-reviewed journals related to nutrition or workplace health;
Excellent communicator, able to collaborate across diverse teams and engage with stakeholders;
Well-organized, reliable, and experienced in supporting research operations (e.g., budgets, admin tasks);
Passionate about nutrition, employee wellbeing, and healthcare innovation;
Fluent in English (Portuguese or Spanish is a plus!).

Salary Range

$119,000.00 - $155,000.00

What’s the role?

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Marketing Analytics team in Brooklyn! Learning new skills and techniques is not only a requirement but a perk of the job. We are always looking for opportunities to improve. Our mission is to demystify marketing with insights grounded in data, telling the story of how we attract and retain our users to teams, to senior management, and to the community.

This is a full-time position reporting to the Manager of Analytics. In addition to salary, you will also be eligible for an equity package, an annual performance bonus, and our competitive benefits that support you and your family as part of your total rewards package at Etsy.

This role requires your presence in Etsy’s Brooklyn Office once or twice per week depending on your proximity to the office. Candidates living within commutable distance of Etsy’s Brooklyn Office Hub may be the first to be considered. Learn more details about our work modes and workplace safety policies here.

What’s this team like at Etsy?

The Marketing Analytics team is responsible for helping drive the success of marketing efforts at Etsy by providing meaningful insights, industry-leading measurement techniques, and access to the metrics, data, and tools needed for decision-making and optimization.

We partner with our peers in marketing, analytics, research, product, engineering, and finance through all stages of development: identifying initial opportunities, refining the user experience, analyzing the impact of our efforts, and highlighting improvement areas. Ultimately, the team’s work strengthens Etsy and helps continuously improve the Etsy experience.

What does the day-to-day look like?


Develop, implement, and refine core marketing measurement frameworks and models, including attribution, CLV, return on investment, experiment methodology, and segmentation.
Drive forward strategy for performance marketing partners by transforming raw data into meaningful and impactful analyses characterized by strong data governance, technique clarity, and clear documentation.
Play a foundational role in deciding how we can best engage and grow Etsy users by determining and helping prioritize opportunities for growth through analysis of behavioral and transactional data.
Identify key metrics that drive the performance of marketing channels and marketing products, make these accessible to partners through dashboards and reports, and drive these metrics through statistical analyses of experiments.
Continually evaluate and refine your technical toolkit, sharing what you learn with the team.
Of course, this is just a sample of the kinds of work this role will require! You should assume that your role will encompass other tasks, too, and that your job duties and responsibilities may change from time to time at Etsy's discretion, or otherwise applicable with local law.


Qualities that will help you thrive in this role are:


2+ years of proven experience as a data scientist/analyst or in a quantitative role in which you extracted meaning from big data sets with little engineering support.
Experience with performance/digital marketing operations, channel attribution, churn and lifetime value models, analytical tools and infrastructure, and finding efficient growth strategies a plus.
Experience working on marketing measurement projects, such as building and deploying models (MTA, LTV, etc.) and running experiments (geoX, CLS, etc.), is a plus.
Proficient in SQL and either R or Python.
Proven ability to communicate your insights verbally, visually, and in writing with teammates and business partners.
Comfortable guiding others, recommending tools and standard methodologies to improve the efficiency of the teams work.
Strong, independent, analytical problem solver who enjoys thinking about and solving complex and nuanced problems.
Passionate about subjects such as experimental design, data visualization, and statistical analysis techniques.
Experience with Looker, Tableau, or other data visualization software a plus.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, analyzing user behavior on a feature to identify areas of improvement, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data analysis, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $140,000 - $170,000 per year.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, analyzing user behavior on a feature to identify areas of improvement, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data analysis, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

What We're Looking For


3+ years of hands-on experience building and deploying ML/AI systems
Strong Python development skills, including experience with production-quality ML codebases
Familiarity with modern ML/NLP frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Hugging Face, spaCy)
Experience working with large-scale unstructured or semi-structured data
Practical knowledge of LLMs: prompt engineering, evaluation, fine-tuning, observability
Comfort working in fast-paced, ambiguous environments where iteration is key
Clear communicator with a collaborative mindset


Bonus Points For


Experience working with clinical or healthcare data (EMRs, registries, imaging, labs, etc.)
Familiarity with model evaluation tooling, quality benchmarking, and drift detection
Exposure to data privacy or compliance frameworks (HIPAA, de-ID workflows, etc.)
Experience in an early-stage startup or small, fast-moving technical team


Why Join Us


Full-Stack AI Impact: Contribute across the ML lifecycle, from data to deployment
Product-Embedded Work: Your contributions will ship as part of a real product, not just R&D
Tight Collaboration: Work directly with cross-functional partners across clinical, product, and engineering
Mission-Driven: Help unlock better healthcare by solving foundational data problems

Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, hello, hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Job Description

Where and how you can work

Our flagship office is in Sydney, Australia, but we've made our way from down under, to a hub in San Francisco, which is now home to our US operations. We offer flexibility in how and where you work. We trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

What You’d Be Doing In This Role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At The Moment, This Role Is Focused On


Owning TikTok end-to-end – leading everything from content strategy and ideation to creation, publishing, engagement, and ongoing optimisation.
Creating bold, native content – making videos that feel right at home on TikTok, resonate with current culture, and reflect Canva’s tone of voice and values.
Collaborating with creators – partnering with our in-house content team, community members, and influencers to bring your ideas to life.
Moving fast and learning faster – jumping on trends, testing new formats, and quickly iterating based on what’s working with your audience.
Staying close to the community – actively tuning into comments, conversations, and creators shaping culture on the platform.
Reporting and reflecting – tracking performance, sharing key insights, and evolving your approach based on results.
Thinking big when it counts – contributing to larger-scale campaigns, partnerships, and brand activations with the broader team.



You're probably a match if


You are a platform-native creative – you instinctively understand how different platforms work, how users behave, and what makes content land, especially on TikTok.
You are a maker at heart – you don’t wait to brief; you shoot, write, edit, and post if it means getting something great out the door fast.
You are obsessed with social – you scroll with intention, study what works, and naturally spot what’s trending and what’s tired.
You are comfortable in a lean, high-trust team – you value autonomy, make confident calls, and own your output from start to finish.
You are a sharp collaborator – you know when to jam with others and when to take the lead and run with a vision.
You are passionate about local culture and community – you create content that feels timely, relevant, and real for a U.S. audience.



About The Team

We’re looking for a social-first creative strategist to own and operate Canva’s TikTok.

This is a hybrid role for someone who blends content craft with platform expertise, and who’s just as confident ideating as they are publishing, engaging, and iterating. You’ll be the creative lead, strategist, and voice of TikTok - working alongside an in-house team of content creators to bring Canva’s brand to life in bold, human, and native ways.

What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a Taste Of What's On Offer


Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
Health benefits plans to support you and your wellbeing
401(k) retirement plan with company contribution
Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally

At Canva we value fairness, and we strive to provide competitive, market-informed compensation whilst ensuring internal equity within the team in each region. We make hiring decisions based on your skills, experience and our overall assessment of what we observed and learnt in the hiring process. The target salary range for this position is $133,000 to $171,000 USD. When calculating offers, we make salary decisions based on market data and candidates' skills and experience.

Other Stuff To Know

We make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. When you apply, please tell us the pronouns you use and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process.

We celebrate all types of skills and backgrounds at Canva so even if you don’t feel like your skills quite match what’s listed above - we still want to hear from you!

If you're shortlisted, we'll ask you to share some examples of your work to help us understand your approach. We may also invite you to submit a short video so we can get to know you better—more details to come if you progress!

Please note that interviews are conducted virtually.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

How You Will Make An Impact


Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency


Preferred Experience


Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python


Who You Are


You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence

In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks.

This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis.

Position Overview




We are hiring an AI/LLM Engineer to help transform how hospital stakeholders interact with data -- using natural language, intelligent agents, and generative AI capabilities. You’ll join a small, fast-moving team working on cutting-edge language model applications directly integrated into our flagship analytics platform, CareMeasurement.




This is a new, hands-on role where you’ll be empowered to ship features with real-world impact. You'll collaborate closely with the product team to extend our current LLM-based chat functionality, build agentic workflows (e.g. data-driven recommendations, email/presentation generation), and explore the frontier of ""why"" question answering in healthcare analytics.




Key Responsibilities




Design, prototype, and productionize AI-powered features using LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Extend our natural language interface to support more complex queries and agentic tasks (e.g. summarizing cost savings opportunities, generating reports or presentations, notifying users).
Build orchestration layers around OpenAI’s APIs and internal data pipelines for reliable and explainable AI responses.
Collaborate cross-functionally with product managers, clinical experts, and backend engineers to deliver seamless, user-focused AI experiences.
Monitor and evaluate model performance and user feedback to guide iteration.
Stay current with LLM and AI trends, and propose pragmatic applications within our domain.




Qualifications




Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years of experience building backend or data-intensive applications, preferably in a SaaS environment.
1+ years working directly with frontier language models (e.g. OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic), including prompt engineering and API orchestration.
Strong Python skills and experience building production-grade features or services.
Familiarity with vector databases and RAG patterns (e.g. Postgres/pgvector or similar).




Bonus Skills




Experience with Django, MySQL, and AWS.
Familiarity with healthcare data or HIPAA-compliant systems.
