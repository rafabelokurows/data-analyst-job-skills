About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics. The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

The Role

We are looking for a hands‑on ML Engineer who lives at the intersection of TTS, STT and large language models. You will design and ship new low‑latency voice capabilities, working closely with product, research and infrastructure teams to push the boundaries of natural, multilingual conversation.

What You’ll Do


Architect & implement real‑time speech pipelines (ASR → LLM → TTS) that meet stringent latency and quality targets.
Evaluate and fine‑tune state‑of‑the‑art ASR, LLM and TTS models—both commercial and open‑source—and integrate the best performers into production.
Optimise inference through quantisation, distillation, hardware‑aware graph compilation and reinforcement‑learning‑based tuning.
Expose scalable APIs & micro‑services with Python/FastAPI, gRPC or WebSocket streaming, backed by robust observability and autoscaling.
Own deployment across cloud and on‑prem environments, collaborating on containerisation (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes) and CI/CD workflows.
Stay ahead of the curve by tracking research, running experiments and sharing learnings with the broader team.


What We’re Looking For


Python Engineering: 5+ years writing production‑grade, well‑tested Python; deep familiarity with async, typing and performance profiling
Speech / Audio: Hands‑on experience building real‑time ASR, TTS, voice chat or streaming audio products
LLM Tooling: Fine‑tuning, prompt design, evaluation, retrieval‑augmented generation; familiarity with frameworks such as Openpipe/ART, LangChain, LlamaIndex or similar
Systems & MLOps: Containerisation, GPU scheduling, observability, DevOps on GCP or AWS; infrastructure‑as‑code principles
API Design: Building and maintaining high‑throughput REST/gRPC/FastAPI services; securing and monitoring them in production


Bonus Points


Model compression expertise (quantisation, pruning, ONNX/TensorRT)
Knowledge of audio and acoustics
Experience with reinforcement‑learning‑from‑human‑feedback (RLHF) or direct preference optimisation

The system would detect colorimetric images and predict with a high level of accuracy discrete pH values, delivering lab-quality diagnostic precision to women and doctors - anytime, anywhere!


Tasks


To make pHera robust and scalable, pHera is looking for a computer vision and machine learning engineer to design and implement the complete computer-vision pipeline: from image capture, colour detection and pH prediction.





Implement computer vision algorithms for color detection from captured images


Integrate machine learning models for accurate pH prediction based colour detection


Ensure performance across different smartphone devices and lighting conditions





Applicants who clearly outline in thier cover letter how they would implement these three tasks will be prioritised.


Requirements



Based in Berlin


Eager to work in an early-stage, science-driven, female health startup


Comfortable with ambiguity, self-directed, and proactive



Benefits


Flexibility: choose freelance, part-time or full-time




Hybrid work environment with office space in Berlin




A competitive salary for 6 months with the possibility of extension




pHera is closing the gender health gap!

Most existing vaginal pH test strips are analog, low-resolution, visually subjective, and

poorly suited for women’s health applications. Doctors need fast, reliable tools to

help with complicated diagnoses. Women deserve clarity, not guesswork when

managing their vaginal health from home. A high-resolution pH test can catch

imbalances early, making it easier to monitor issues like bacterial vaginosis,

recurring vaginal infections, sexually transmitted infections, ovulation, PCOS, and

menopause. By building pHera, you would be building a tool that would advance women's health.

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

You would be joining a flexible and dynamic team and your role will include:


selecting features, building and optimizing classifiers using machine learning techniques
processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
deep dive on the problems using SQL and scripting languages to drive solutions leveraging Statistical Analysis
implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone. Our recruitment process is free from discrimination of any kind — including on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

With over 25 employees from more than 15 different countries, our diversity drives innovation, enriches our culture, and challenges us to consider multiple perspectives every day.

Deep understanding and practical application of Statistical Hypothesis Testing and A/B Testing / Randomized Controlled Trials (including advanced techniques).
Strong stakeholder management skills, notably collaborating with and influencing Data Scientists and Analysts.
Proficiency in R or Python (we work in Python, but this can be acquired) and SQL.
Practical experience with Computational Statistics techniques (e.g., Simulation, Bootstrapping, Bayesian methods) is huge plus.
We appreciate your proven experience in selecting and practically applying appropriate Causal Inference methods (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, instrumental variables) based on data constraints



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 600+ cities across 50+ countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.
Accelerate your professional growth with unique career opportunities.
Get a rewarding salary and stock option package that lets you focus on doing your best work.
Enjoy the flexibility of working in a hybrid mode with a minimum of 3 days in the office each week to foster strong connections and teamwork.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions.

Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We're building the software infrastructure for the decarbonised energy system, backed by some of the best investors in the world (TechCrunch).

We make the technology to move energy usage to times when electricity is cheap and green. Our software controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries. We use machine learning to figure out what energy people will need, and when they'll need it. We control tens of thousands of energy assets, and we're growing quickly.

Requirements

Read more about what we're building here.

You can expect:


insane amounts of ownership
hard technical challenges
that what you build is commercially and environmentally valuable


In return, we ask for:


the courage to build new things fast
a commitment to real world impact over technical perfection
a desire to help build and lead an exceptional and tight knit team
deep-seated motivation to combat climate change


And it'd be nice if you could bring:


knowledge of the electricity system, specifically power trading
comfort speaking to clients (we're a small team and we all wear many hats)
familiarity with time-series data


You shouldn't apply if:


uncertainty scares you
you aren't prepared to try, fail, and try again
you're looking for a low intensity, low impact role


Interview process


Initial interview
Take-home exercise
Final interview (in-person)
Offer, references, and welcome to the team!


Tech stack

🐍 We do everything in Python, because it allows data scientists and engineers to collaborate closely and move quickly. Our data scientists write lots of production code. We ❤️ Streamlit.

🎨 We try a bunch of things in Figma before we build them in code, because it's a fast and cheap way to get feedback.

🐋 Everything we build lives in Docker, for minimal cross-platform faff and maximal reproducibility.

☁️ We deploy on GCP

Benefits

We love the idea of fully remote work but it doesn't... work. For very early stage companies, people learn faster, get on better, and accomplish more when they're spending a decent chunk of time together. We ask that you spend 2-3 days a week in our London office.

We are extremely keen to build a diverse company, and we're particularly eager to hear from candidates who don't fit the traditional engineering stereotypes. If you're motivated by our mission, please do reach out, even if you feel you might not ‘check all the boxes'.

Company Description

ARGO is building the fastest AI engine to understand small companies (SME) across the UK & US. This will improve how SMEs access financial services. SMEs are the engine of any economy, we need to do better for them to thrive.

The company was started by serial entrepreneurs with a strong track record. We have an office in Shoreditch and are backed by prominent venture capital firms from the US & Europe.

This is an AI startup that is heavy on Data, ML Algorithms + LLMs.

Role Description

This is a full-time hybrid role for a Senior Engineer (ML Engineer):


Strong background in Pattern Recognition, Computer Science, and Statistics
Expertise in LLMs and Algorithms
Experience with data preprocessing and feature extraction
Proficiency in programming languages like Python or R (4+ years)
Knowledge of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch
Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills
What you don't know, we can teach - as long as you have the desire to learn.
We are a group of serious engineers, and looking to add a few more who have experience with Python, Machine learning, data pipelines and scalable infrastructure (we are mostly on AWS)
This is a startup, so being able to sit across a few areas is always appreciated. You are going to be treated like a member of the Founding team and get to participate in key decisions.
We will be filing patents for some of our work, and you can be involved should you be interested in being named on a patent.


Other Details

The company is ~12 people, we are now looking to bring on 3 more Engineers who can build this further. We are live in the market serving customers and earning revenue.

Our work spans across Data, Machine Learning and intelligent use of LLMs to enable us to reach the capability of human underwriters. This is a big challenge that will take us a few years to reach, but we have a strong headstart given the founding team's prior experiences within this field. And the impact on any economy is significant as SMEs often employ over half the population.

We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world.

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Role Overview:

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalization.

What you will be doing:

You’ll join a London-based agile team building and supporting data science products that drive business impact across PlayStation. You’ll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to serve teams such as marketing, operations, engineering, product planning, R&D, and finance.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Help drive data literacy across the business
Collaborate with a high-performing team of data scientists to apply insights and drive innovation throughout the company.


Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

What you'll be doing:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience
Experience applying data science techniques such as supervised/unsupervised learning, segmentation, forecasting, causal inference, and uplift modelling
Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:


Experience with data science tooling (e.g., workflow orchestrators like Airflow, feature stores)
Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)
Private Medical Insurance
Dental Scheme
25 days holiday per year
On Site Gym
Subsidised Café
Free soft drinks
On site bar

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements

Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations

Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$172,000 - C$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.
