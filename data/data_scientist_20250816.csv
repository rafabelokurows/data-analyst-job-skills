We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

You will build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for critical decision-making, along with self-service tools that empower business partners
You will develop models that become core to our operations, such as optimizing marketing outreach strategies or building a marketing forecasting model
You will collaborate closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high-fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines that serve as the foundation for Marketing analytics


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as data scientist partnering with business functions such as Marketing and GTM
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results
You have expertise in SQL, and least one scripting language (Python or R)

You can effectively communicate data insights and transform them into stories that drive business impact
You have strong communication and collaboration skills while working in cross-functional environments
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy


Nice To Haves


Experience working directly with Marketing, Sales, and other GTM teams
Background at a high-growth B2B SaaS startup
Familiarity with our product (being a current Notion user would be great!)


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, analyzing user behavior on a feature to identify areas of improvement, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data analysis, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

At Weave, our mission is to evolve how therapeutic knowledge is communicated, transformed, and worked upon. We are doing so by equipping human minds with AI instruments to enable the best drugs to be brought to patients as rapidly, safely, and inexpensively as possible.

The Weave Platform streamlines regulatory submission preparation and lifecycle management by imbuing most aspects of the workflow with AI, including data organization, drafting, review, and verification. Weave is building the foundation for a singular AI workbench for the entire therapeutic lifecycle.

The Role & Your Mission

Weave accelerates the way therapeutic knowledge is created, organized, and shared. The Research team fuels the engine running that mission—turning novel and state-of-the-art AI into practical and impactful capabilities and open science contributions. Your work will:


Super-charge Weave's people with internal tools that cut busy-work for product, engineering, and commercial teams.
Elevate our platform by inventing and benchmarking algorithms that make LLM-powered workflows much more reliable and robust.
Advance the field through peer-reviewed papers, open datasets, and collaborations with leading academic & industry labs.


What You'll Own


Invent & prototype new ideas: turn white-board ideas into controlled experiments and live demos.
Push LLM frontiers: combine large-language models with retrieval, symbolic reasoning, or classic ML; optimize for accuracy, reliability, robustness, latency, and cost.
Measure ruthlessly: Define crisp hypotheses, select fit-for-purpose metrics (incl. human-in-the-loop), run statistically sound studies, and iterate fast.
Publish & open-source: Write high-quality papers, release evaluation suites, and present at NeurIPS/ACL/ICML—or local meet-ups if that's your style.
Seed the future: Maintain a balanced portfolio: near-term product wins, mid-term reliability projects, and ""moon-shot"" research that could 10× our differentiation.
Level-up the team: Lead paper clubs, mentor interns & junior scientists, and model best practices in reproducible science and kind collaboration.


What You'll Bring


PhD (or equivalent depth) in ML, Physics, Math, Engineering, computational linguistics, or a closely related field.
Proven research chops: First-author publications at top venues (NeurIPS, ACL, ICML, EMNLP, etc.).
LLM mastery: experience fine-tuning, prompt-engineering, and augmenting models with external knowledge/tooling.
Experimental rigor: fluent in benchmarking, statistical testing, and clear visualization of complex results.
Production-grade coding: Python + ML stacks (PyTorch/JAX), version control, and comfort reading & contributing to large codebases; bonus for database fluency (Neo4j, Postgres, MongoDB).
Storytelling skills: you can explain a log-probability trick to executives and translate product pain-points into concrete research questions.
Bonus points for: open-source maintainer experience, safety/bias evaluation expertise, or a successful track record of bridging academia and industry.

Max AI is the World's first human-free, fully-autonomous medical billing AI agent.

Many startups are attempting to attack this problem because the market is so big — $350B/yr.

We have the best team going after it.

While everyone else still needs humans in the loop, we've cracked the code for medical billing starting with dermatology, and are rapidly adding support for every other specialty.

Medical doctors who code are rare. We have the best one in the world. His previous apps have driven 50M+ downloads, all while running an incredibly successful practice of his own where he literally did the billing by hand himself. Our Head of AI has been doing AI research at MIT and Caltech for over 10 years. And our Head of Engineering was one of the earliest engineers at Figma.

CZ Biohub SF itself supports some of the brightest, boldest engineers, data scientists, and biomedical researchers to investigate the fundamental mechanisms underlying disease and develop new technologies that will lead to actionable diagnostics and effective therapies. We are guided by our values of scholarly excellence; disruptive innovation; hands-on engineering/hacking/building; partnership and collaboration; open communication and respect; inclusiveness; and opportunity for all.

Our Vision


We pursue large scientific challenges that cannot be pursued in conventional environments
We enable individual investigators to pursue their riskiest and most innovative ideas
The technologies developed at CZ Biohub San Francisco facilitate research by scientists and clinicians at our home institutions and beyond


Diversity of thought, ideas, and perspectives are at the heart of CZ Biohub Network and enable disruptive innovation and scholarly excellence. We are committed to cultivating an organization where all colleagues feel inspired and know their work makes an important contribution.

The Opportunity

We’re a cross-disciplinary institute on an audacious quest: to chart the dynamic architecture of cells at a scale and resolution once thought impossible. By uniting biology, engineering, and computation, we invent the breakthrough technologies this vision demands. Recent innovations from our team include an automated CRISPR experiment design engine that performs comprehensive optimizations while operating at the genome-wide scale (Peng et al. Nucleic Acids Research 2024). Leveraging such tools, we generated open-source datasets that illuminate the spatial organization of the human proteome in healthy and diseased states (Cho et al. Science 2022, Hein et al. Cell 2025).

We’re gearing up for our most ambitious push yet, as our next Computational Biologist you will architect and build the computational backbone that powers our upcoming large scale CRISPR experiments in both human cells, organoids and even whole organisms (zebrafish). These studies will span precise knock-in/out, high-content image-based CRISPR screening and programmable expression control—converting diverse perturbation datasets into systematic biological insights. Join us in San Francisco (with a planned move to Redwood City in two years) and drive the next wave of methodological innovation and scientific discovery that will redefine how dynamic cellular systems are decoded.

This role will be based in San Francisco initially, with a planned transition to Redwood City in two years.

About The Role(s)

Depending on the team, you could:


Own protocol data: Build and ship end-to-end features for the Artemis terminal while developing a scalable data platform for analysts.
Build open dashboards: Create the best free, on-chain dashboards for anyone to access and use to understand digital finance.
Advance the crypto industry: Deliver industry-leading data paired with clear, first-principles insights.
Grow your presence: Share your work publicly and establish yourself as a recognized thought leader in the space.

As part of the Shopping Data Science team, you will be an integral partner to the broader Zillow Growth & Shopping Product Data Science team (GSDS). The GSDS team is an impactful ensemble of multiple key business functions, including User growth, Integrated Communications, Property search and evaluation, and Onsite Testing that acquire and engage millions of users across our platforms.

The GSDS team is tasked with organizing, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets from various sources to help advise both short and long-term decision-making. Our structure is very flat, and you will soon find yourself working directly with Senior Leadership.

About The Role

You will analyze how customers interact with our several platforms to find their next home, using these insights to advise design and product development. You will provide thought leadership in crafting an outstanding shopping experience for Zillow users, playing a pivotal role in developing the long-term vision of our product ecosystem. You will have frequent opportunities to share your analyses and recommendations with colleagues across the organization and see the results of your efforts affect millions of people. In this role, you will:


Partner with product & engineering to help craft a long-term customer strategy.
Use sophisticated analytics, including clustering, propensity modeling, and causal inference techniques to gain a clearer picture of customer behavior.
Build compelling data stories and visualizations to influence decision-makers.
Design, analyze, and interpret A/B experiments with statistical precision.
Identify and track business-critical metrics; analyze, measure, and report levers that help move them.
Collaborate with fellow Data Scientists to build and improve the DS infrastructure (ETLs, dashboards, experimentation platform, tracking, etc.)


This role has been categorized as a teleworker position. Teleworkers do not have a permanent corporate office workplace and, instead, work from a physical location of their choice which must be identified to the Company. Employees may live in any part of Mexico, but preferably in Mexico City, as we would encourage attendance for occasional in-office events.

In addition to a competitive base salary and benefits, this position is also eligible for equity awards based on factors such as experience, performance and location.

Who you are

We are looking for someone passionate about experimentation, translating complicated data sets and business problems into easily consumable and impactful insights. You will also need to be unafraid of tackling complexity and new business problems. We're searching for a Data Scientist who has:


An undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g. mathematics, engineering, statistics, finance, analytics or similar)
3+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis, data science, complex problem solving. Prior experience in product analytics is a plus!
3+ years of experience implementing a variety of measurement methods across modeling and testing for various marketing use cases
3+ years or more of experience as a data scientist experience querying multi-terabyte-sized noisy data sets such as clickstream data.
A strong understanding of statistical concepts, A/B testing, measurement methods, and causal inference techniques as it relates to the marketing space.
Mastery of SQL, and either Python or R.
Experience in modeling techniques like time series forecasting, logistic regression or more complex modeling approaches (like xgboost, random forest)
Ability to work cross-functionally and strong written, verbal, and visual communication skills.

CZ Biohub SF itself supports some of the brightest, boldest engineers, data scientists, and biomedical researchers to investigate the fundamental mechanisms underlying disease and develop new technologies that will lead to actionable diagnostics and effective therapies. We are guided by our values of scholarly excellence; disruptive innovation; hands-on engineering/hacking/building; partnership and collaboration; open communication and respect; inclusiveness; and opportunity for all.

Our Vision


We pursue large scientific challenges that cannot be pursued in conventional environments
We enable individual investigators to pursue their riskiest and most innovative ideas
The technologies developed at CZ Biohub San Francisco facilitate research by scientists and clinicians at our home institutions and beyond


Diversity of thought, ideas, and perspectives are at the heart of CZ Biohub Network and enable disruptive innovation and scholarly excellence. We are committed to cultivating an organization where all colleagues feel inspired and know their work makes an important contribution.

The Opportunity

We’re a cross-disciplinary institute on an audacious quest: to chart the dynamic architecture of cells at a scale and resolution once thought impossible. By uniting biology, engineering, and computation, we invent the breakthrough technologies this vision demands. Recent innovations from our team include an automated CRISPR experiment design engine that performs comprehensive optimizations while operating at the genome-wide scale (Peng et al. Nucleic Acids Research 2024). Leveraging such tools, we generated open-source datasets that illuminate the spatial organization of the human proteome in healthy and diseased states (Cho et al. Science 2022, Hein et al. Cell 2025).

We’re gearing up for our most ambitious push yet, as our next Computational Biologist you will architect and build the computational backbone that powers our upcoming large scale CRISPR experiments in both human cells, organoids and even whole organisms (zebrafish). These studies will span precise knock-in/out, high-content image-based CRISPR screening and programmable expression control—converting diverse perturbation datasets into systematic biological insights. Join us in San Francisco (with a planned move to Redwood City in two years) and drive the next wave of methodological innovation and scientific discovery that will redefine how dynamic cellular systems are decoded.

This role will be based in San Francisco initially, with a planned transition to Redwood City in two years.

You will


Architect, build and maintain computation workflows for CRISPR design and edit-outcome analysis.
Analyze genome-scale CRISPR perturbation datasets and identify emergent gene-function and pathway networks.
Work with molecular biologists, imaging scientists, and software engineers to plan large scale CRISPR experiments and interpret results.
Package, document and rigorously test code, computational pipelines and datasets for open-source release.
Author publications and present research findings at conferences.


You have

Essential –


Ph.D. in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Bioengineering, Genomics or a related discipline. Candidates with a master’s degree and 3 years of relevant experience will be considered.
2+ years of deep, current knowledge of CRISPR genome-engineering technologies (e.g. CRISPRi/a, base/prime editing, CRISPR-based imaging) and the underlying molecular biology.
Proven track record of developing computational pipelines for CRISPR design and edit-outcome analysis.
Fluency in Python (or similar), experience with workflow management frameworks (e.g., Nextflow, Snakemake), and strong software engineering practices including testing, continuous integration, documentation, and version control.
A collaborative, team-focused mindset coupled with outstanding communication skills.


Nice to have -


Experience in analyzing CRISPR perturbations datasets at single cell resolution (e.g. perturb-seq).
Experience in designing, optimizing and executing bioinformatics pipelines for amplicon sequencing, whole-genome sequencing and genome variant analyses.
Experience in utilizing high-performance computing systems for large-scale data processing and analysis.

As one of the first pioneers of earned wage access, our passion at EarnIn is building products that deliver real-time financial flexibility for those with the unique needs of living paycheck to paycheck. Our community members access their earnings as they earn them, with options to spend, save, and grow their money without mandatory fees, interest rates, or credit checks.

We’re fortunate to have an incredibly experienced leadership team, combined with world-class funding partners like A16Z, Matrix Partners, DST, Ribbit Capital, and a very healthy core business with a tremendous runway. We’re growing fast and are excited to continue bringing world-class talent onboard to help shape the next chapter of our growth journey.

We are seeking an experienced and visionary Head of Machine Learning to lead and scale our machine learning efforts across the company. As a fintech company where machine learning (ML) is integral to both our business strategy and user experience, we depend on robust, scalable ML systems to drive impactful decisions and deliver exceptional customer value. Our mission is to pioneer success stories through generative AI and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, generating transformative business and societal impact.

The Head of ML will focus on the operational excellence of our machine learning systems—creating and executing a vision of taking ML models from research to production, ensuring high performance, reliability, and maintainability. The ideal candidate will have a history of deploying ML models at scale, particularly in fast-paced startup environments. A strong foundation in coding, familiarity with production-level ML engineering practices, and the ability to bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementation are essential.

The Mountain View base salary range for this full-time position is $414,000 to $506,000, plus equity and benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. This is a hybrid position in Mountain View, requiring in-office work 2 days a week.

What You'll Do:

Define and own the machine learning roadmap in alignment with business goals.
Lead the ML organization, consisting of multiple teams to design, develop, and optimize ML-based models and systems.
Drive a culture of scientific and engineering rigor and real-world pragmatism in your team's work, particularly to quantify the impact of features on relevant engagement metrics.
Collaborate with data engineers, product managers, and marketing to coordinate timely deployments from conception to release

What We're Looking For:

MS or Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, Statistics or a related technical field, and or equivalent work experience
10+ years of experience in Engineering or Scientific domains,
7+ years of experience as a team builder and leader in hiring, developing, and managing high-performing teams
Extensive breadth and depth of knowledge of machine learning algorithms
Industry experience building and productionizing machine learning systems
Advanced knowledge of Python, SQL
Strong oral and written communication skills

At EarnIn, we believe that the best way to build a financial system that works for everyday people is by hiring a team that represents our diverse community. Our team is diverse not only in background and experience but also in perspective. We celebrate our diversity and strive to create a culture of belonging. EarnIn does not unlawfully discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender identity, gender expression, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, physical or mental disability, legally protected medical condition, family care status, military or veteran status, marital status, registered domestic partner status, sexual orientation, genetic information, or any other basis protected by local, state, or federal laws.

At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive. Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.


About the team

We don't build pricing models, we build the driving intelligence that feeds them. Our mission is to drive safer roads and fairer insurance through data.

The Telematics team transforms raw phone sensor data into meaningful insights about how people drive. Using advanced signal processing and machine learning, we process high-frequency data to extract behavioural signals that power our understanding of driving quality, context, and risk.


About the Role

As a Lead Data Scientist, you'll drive the technical direction of our behavioural modelling work. You'll lead the development of telematics features from idea to production, including exploratory analysis, signal design, risk evaluation, and scalable deployment.

This is a hands-on leadership role where you'll design solutions, mentor other scientists, influence architecture across systems, and guide decision-making in uncertain or complex contexts.

We're looking for an applied scientist - someone who thrives on getting things into production, values strong engineering, and has opinions on building reliable, scalable systems.



What you will be doing

Drive the development of telematics features from mobile sensor data, including project design, modelling, validation, and deployment

Conduct deep dives into driving signals, develop hypotheses, and evaluate their predictive power for risk
Design technical solutions with clear trade-offs around performance, scalability, and maintainability


Collaborate closely with data engineers, software engineers, mobile developers, and PMs to deliver production-grade features

Mentor data scientists, set high standards for technical quality, and promote knowledge sharing and learning

Own delivery of large, complex projects, breaking them into milestones, planning collaboratively, and unblocking teams

Contribute to Request For Comments (RFCs), design reviews, and technical discussions and initiatives with high technical ambiguity

Ensure that our models and features are observable, tested, and continuously improving

Help shape the team roadmap and longer-term strategy for behavioural signal development


About You

          <p><strong>About Zego</strong></p><p>At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive.

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in...

How you’ll help us achieve it

Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users. And, we’re still in the early days of our product roadmap and potential impact on people’s everyday lives.

We’re looking for an experienced Data Scientist and help grow and strengthen our user base. You’ll work on high-impact use cases with millions of users, such as optimizing our existing scratch card rewards program or designing and launching entirely new initiatives from scratch.

The technical challenges range from crafting simple heuristics when data is sparse to applying advanced techniques like geospatial analytics, network analysis, and uplift modeling. You’ll own the full cycle: defining the right approach, implementing it, and shipping it in production.

This role is highly experimentation-driven: you’ll be able to rapidly test ideas, learn from real user feedback, and iterate quickly.

          <strong>Our mission<br><br></strong>We're making Africa the first cashless continent.<br><br>In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.<br><br>We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.<br><br>Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in...<br><br><strong><strong>How you’ll help us achieve it <br><br></strong></strong>Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users.

Here, you’ll move fast, take on meaningful challenges, and be recognized for the impact you deliver. It’s a place where ambition gets met with opportunity – and where your growth is in your hands.

We work as one team, and we back each other to succeed. So whatever your background or identity, if you’re ready to grow and make a difference, you’ll be right at home here.

It’s important we set you up for success and make our process as accessible as possible. So let us know in your application, or tell your recruiter directly, if you need anything to make your experience or working environment more comfortable.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Power digital products with AI. Work with product teams to identify high-impact opportunities where AI can transform the user experience for millions—and then build the solutions to make them happen. Drive the process from possibility to production, delivering code that’s robust, reproducible, and built for scale.
Explore ways to push the boundaries of our AI capabilities. Stay at the bleeding edge of AI by investigating new models, techniques, and research. Learn fast across new domains, share findings with the team, and turn breakthrough ideas into production systems that deliver real-world impact.
Refine data foundations for exceptional results. Own the full data lifecycle—from acquisition and labeling to loading and management—to ensure our models are trained on clean, high-quality datasets that power top-performing systems.
Own your impact, end-to-end. Set smart priorities, manage execution, and consistently deliver high-quality results, even in ambiguous or fast-changing environments. Balance technical depth with strong ownership, growing your skills while delivering meaningful contributions.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities—just let us know through this form.

Before you apply
If you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.

To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you’re welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries—depending on what we agree at the offer stage.

If the role speaks to you and you’re excited to give your best, we’d love to hear from you. Apply now—we can’t wait to meet you.

If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.</li><li><strong>All. These. Benefits.</strong> Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location.

If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.<br><br>We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.<br><br>Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience.
