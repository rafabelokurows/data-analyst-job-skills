About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics. The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

Expose scalable APIs & micro‑services with Python/FastAPI, gRPC or WebSocket streaming, backed by robust observability and autoscaling.
Own deployment across cloud and on‑prem environments, collaborating on containerisation (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes) and CI/CD workflows.
Stay ahead of the curve by tracking research, running experiments and sharing learnings with the broader team.


What We’re Looking For


Python Engineering: 5+ years writing production‑grade, well‑tested Python; deep familiarity with async, typing and performance profiling
Speech / Audio: Hands‑on experience building real‑time ASR, TTS, voice chat or streaming audio products
LLM Tooling: Fine‑tuning, prompt design, evaluation, retrieval‑augmented generation; familiarity with frameworks such as Openpipe/ART, LangChain, LlamaIndex or similar
Systems & MLOps: Containerisation, GPU scheduling, observability, DevOps on GCP or AWS; infrastructure‑as‑code principles
API Design: Building and maintaining high‑throughput REST/gRPC/FastAPI services; securing and monitoring them in production


Bonus Points


Model compression expertise (quantisation, pruning, ONNX/TensorRT)
Knowledge of audio and acoustics
Experience with reinforcement‑learning‑from‑human‑feedback (RLHF) or direct preference optimisation
Contributions to open‑source ML/speech projects (share your GitHub!)
Familiarity with GPU inference servers (Triton, KServe) or distributed compute frameworks (Ray)

With over 30 million automated calls handled, 4 million hours saved in contact centres, and 99.9% uptime, their no-code platform is powering the future of voice AI.




Backed by the investors behind Facebook and GroupOn and trusted by 1,000+ companies, they enable enterprises to deploy multilingual, human-like voice agents at scale.




Role Overview:




The ML Engineer will join the founding team, shaping real-time, low-latency speech systems from the ground up. This is a hands-on, architecture-level role - building end-to-end voice pipelines that combine ASR, LLMs, and TTS, and scaling them across mission-critical environments.




Key Responsibilities:




Design and deploy real-time ASR → LLM → TTS pipelines optimised for speed and naturalness
Fine-tune and integrate best-in-class open-source and commercial models across ASR, TTS, and LLMs
Optimise inference performance using techniques like quantisation, distillation, and RL-based tuning
Build high-throughput, low-latency APIs using Python, FastAPI, gRPC, and WebSocket streaming
Own deployment workflows across cloud and on-prem, collaborating on Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD
Stay ahead of the curve — run experiments, track new research, and help keep the team at the cutting edge




Qualifications:




Deep experience in Python.
Proven hands-on work with real-time ASR, TTS, voice chat, or streaming audio systems
Familiarity with LLM tooling - prompt design, fine-tuning, RAG, and frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or OpenPipe




You’ll push the boundaries of what voice AI can do in production - balancing model quality, latency, and scalability - while working across product, infra, and research to ship new capabilities into the hands of real users.




If you want to build the voice layer of enterprise AI - and work at the frontier of real-time language, speech, and systems - we’d love to hear from you.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Data Scientist at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You translate biomedical challenges into concrete machine learning research roadmaps and coordinate their execution. Together with your colleagues you develop elegant solutions to complex problems, conduct rigorous experiments and finally convince your stakeholders with crystal clear presentations.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Form of Employment: Full-time

Starting Date: As soon as possible

Application Deadline: 24 August 2025


Please note that this position may be closed earlier than the deadline if a certain number of applications are received; therefore, early applications are encouraged.


Contract Duration: initially 2 years, with the possibility of extension.

Location: Berlin

Democracy Reporting International (DRI) is a non-partisan, independent, not-for-profit organisation registered in Berlin. DRI promotes the political participation of citizens, accountability of state bodies, and the development of democratic institutions worldwide.

DRI’s Europe team works on democracy-related issues across the EU, its neighbours and accession countries. Thematically, our work centres on enabling public participation, protecting the rule of law, strengthening local governance, reducing polarisation, and promoting democratic innovation. The team is also closely collaborating with DRI’s digital democracy unit, which deals with issues of political disinformation, hate speech, algorithms, and platform design in the region.

DRI is engaged in several key projects related to the rule of law, human rights and judiciary in Europe. These include work on promoting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, strengthening strategic litigation on the rule of law and fundamental rights and supporting the accession process of countries wishing to join the EU. We are implementing our flagship ‘re:constitution: Exchange and Analysis on Democracy and the Rule of Law in Europe’ programme, aimed at facilitating a fact-based debate around topical questions on the rule of law across the European Union, by providing timely and relevant analyses aimed at supporting policymakers and journalists in shaping the discourse on the rule of law.

To expand its research and analysis capability, DRI is looking for a full-time Research Officer for our head office in Berlin. This position is subject to the expected approval of funding.

Work with our Communications Team on shaping project outputs and delivering them to target audiences;

Engage with policymakers from EU institutions, international organisations, Member State governments and other authorities;
Work on relevant outputs with external research partners and contributors, including re:constitution programme fellows;
Provide capacity building in the form of training, workshops and other educational activities;
Be ready to travel, in exceptional cases also on weekends;
Contribute to the broader work of the programme team as required.


Your Skills And Experience

Required:


Advanced law degree, ideally in EU law, public law, constitutional law or a similar field
At least 3 years of legal experience through research or practice
Deep knowledge of the current state of the rule of law in the EU
Excellent written and oral communication skills, with the ability to communicate complex legal matters to a non-specialist, non-academic audience
Demonstrated understanding of gender equality, diversity and inclusion, and the ability to mainstream these in project activities and result areas
A proactive approach to tasks, flexible, organised, and self-sufficient
Ability to work in an international multi-cultural setting
Complete professional fluency in English and at least one other official language of the EU


Preferred: (optional)


Prior professional focus on the rule of law or the judiciary
Social media presence or interest in having one
Previous experience of writing for a non-academic audience
Some experience in delivering participatory training/ teaching
Fundraising experience, including with EU-funded research
Quantitative analysis skills and knowledge of relevant tools, such as statistical computing software, databases etc.
Knowledge of French, Spanish, Hungarian or Romanian


What We Offer

DRI offers you:


Flexible working hours
Hybrid work model (depending on the role/team)
30 days of annual leave
A contribution to public transport (company ticket with BVG)
Vocational training for every employee
Comprehensive onboarding to help you settle easily and familiarise yourself with DRI
Regular team events (yearly retreat, BBQ, etc.)
Opportunity to work in a diverse team in the heart of Berlin, where everybody is on first-name terms with each other.
Budget for educational activities and self-growth (750 EUR)


Application Instructions

In the interest of transparency, the salary band for this position is 41.250 – 45.600 € (depending on former relevant experience).

They're building intelligent systems that do more than just automate — they understand, adapt, and learn in real time. And now they’re looking for a Senior Data Scientist to shape the next phase of their AI-driven product evolution.




As a core member of the Data Science team, you won’t just be running models — you’ll be designing end-to-end data workflows, building and evaluating state-of-the-art AI systems, and working alongside engineers and product teams to translate insights into real-world impact. This is your opportunity to work on bleeding-edge ML with purpose — in an environment where experimentation and bold ideas are part of the DNA.




What you’ll be working with:

A modern data stack: Python, SQL, and TypeScript (for integration)
Leading ML/AI frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, HuggingFace
Scalable infrastructure: GCP, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Firestore, AlloyDB
Productionizing ML: from fine-tuning foundation models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.) to optimizing deployment pipelines
Cross-functional collaboration with engineers, designers, and domain experts to shape smart, adaptive AI products




What they’re looking for:

Strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and modern data science libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
Hands-on experience with ML model development and deployment (bonus: exposure to LLMs and generative AI)
A solid grasp of data architecture, experimentation, and performance evaluation
A collaborative mindset with a track record of working across disciplines to solve complex problems
Experience in startup or fast-paced environments is a plus




Why this role?

Autonomy & Ownership: You’ll shape how data science is done — from tools to strategy
Impact: Your models and insights will directly influence core product experiences
Real-world AI: Build systems that are used, not just published
Growth: Join at an early stage with equity, a strong mission, and rapid professional growth

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Role Overview:

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalization.

What you will be doing:

You’ll join a London-based agile team building and supporting data science products that drive business impact across PlayStation. You’ll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to serve teams such as marketing, operations, engineering, product planning, R&D, and finance.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Help drive data literacy across the business
Collaborate with a high-performing team of data scientists to apply insights and drive innovation throughout the company.


Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

What you'll be doing:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience
Experience applying data science techniques such as supervised/unsupervised learning, segmentation, forecasting, causal inference, and uplift modelling
Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:


Experience with data science tooling (e.g., workflow orchestrators like Airflow, feature stores)
Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)
Private Medical Insurance
Dental Scheme
25 days holiday per year
On Site Gym
Subsidised Café
Free soft drinks
On site bar
Access to cycle garage and showers

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be.

Design intuitive visualisations to communicate findings and insights to clients, technical and non-technical stakeholders
Lead model deployment with an eye for performance, scalability, and real time low-latency inference




Other points you’ll support on:

Bring experience or gain knowledge to act as a subject matter expert in open banking, payment networks (ACH, RTP), and real-time risk infrastructure is a strong plus.
Bring experience or gain knowledge to act as a subject matter expert in designing and deploying real-time risk models, ideally in the context of A2A payments or other financial transaction systems is a strong plus.
Bring experience or gain knowledge to act as a subject matter expert in fraud detection, creditworthiness assessment, and optimising transaction approval rates using advanced DS/ML techniques is a strong plus.




Experience

Required skills

Hands-on experience building and deploying ML models in Python
SQL skills and familiarity with AWS for deployment and data workflows.
Strong knowledge of statistical modelling, anomaly detection, clustering, and supervised/unsupervised learning
Experience working with large-scale data
Proven success collaborating with product and engineering teams to ship ML-based features and tools
Strong communication skills and business acumen to present complex technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders
Curious, proactive, and comfortable working in ambiguity in a scaling startup environment
Proficiency with data visualisation tools such as Tableau, PowerBI
Degree with 5+ years of relevant experience, OR equivalent




Nice to Have

Demonstrated ability to design and validate features using transactional and behavioral data from financial services

Relay is fundamentally reshaping how goods move in an online era. Backed by Europe’s largest-ever logistics Series A ($35M), led by deep-tech investors Plural (whose portfolio spans fusion energy and space exploration), Relay is scaling faster than 99.98% of venture-backed startups. We're assembling the most talent-dense team the logistics industry has ever seen

THE TEAM


~90 people, more than half in engineering, product and data
45+ advanced degrees across computer science, mathematics and operations research
Thousands of data points captured, calculated, analysed and predicted for every single parcel we handle
An intellectually vibrant culture of first‑principles thinking, tight feedback loops and relentless experimentation


Work Alongside Industry Leaders

Andy Turner – Director of Data

Andy Turner has built and led data teams across global enterprises and high growth scale ups on five continents. He has delivered cloud native platforms, launched AI products end to end, and holds patents for novel machine learning applications in the UK Capital Markets. Trained in statistics at Oxford, he pairs strong technical fundamentals with clear judgement, a commercial focus, and a bias to deliver.

Relay’s Mission

Relay exists to free commerce from friction. Today, high delivery costs act as a hidden tax on e-commerce, quietly shaping what can be sold online and limiting who can participate. We envision a world where more goods move more freely between more people, making the online shopping experience seamless and accessible to everyone.

In This Future


Delivery feels invisible—free shipping is the default, and logistical friction disappears from consumers' minds.
Retailers of all sizes thrive equally online, whether selling a £5 item or a £500 one, as delivery becomes universally efficient and cost-effective.


Just as the internet eliminates friction from communication, Relay removes friction from the movement of goods, enabling broader participation and creating new opportunities for merchants and consumers alike.

Tech Stack Highlights


Cloud-native on GCP with extensive use of BigQuery and Cloud Run
Extensive use of ML modelling and LLM inference - no gimmicks here, this is our daily routine
Python, Rust and TypeScript - we keep things simple but use the right tool for the job
Cross-platform Flutter apps with a deep focus on user experience
Emerging tech integrations, including robotics and IoT-powered operations


The Opportunity

As a highly operational business, we rely on data science to power every part of our network. From day one, we’ve built Relay around a deep understanding of our supply chain, using our best-in-class data assets to set strategy, improve quality, and optimise performance across every layer of the network. Our high-impact data team works across forecasting, optimisation, pricing, geospatial modelling, infrastructure planning, and more. Whether it’s planning courier capacity, guiding pitstop expansion, or improving the economics of delivery, our work directly shapes how Relay scales.

We are looking for Data Scientists to join our growing data team; these are hands-on roles with wide scope and strong exposure to decision-making. You’ll partner closely with operations, product, and commercial teams to solve practical problems with real-world impact, often working from messy datasets and complex systems, where the answers don’t sit neatly in one model. You’ll be embedded in cross-functional teams, helping drive cost, quality, and reliability across the network. If you’re motivated by fast feedback loops, strong ownership, with strong exposure to leadership, and the chance to shape a growing system from the inside out, we’d love to hear from you.

Open Roles

Data Scientist - Middle Mile and Pitstops

Responsibilities

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Middle Mile and Pitstops squad, responsible for the growth, performance, and economics of both our Middle Mile Fleet, and our Pitstop network. This role spans across domains, touching forecasting, pricing, operations, and commercial planning, and is ideal for someone who thrives on applying models in ambiguous, real-world environments. Example projects include:


Modelling and improving the cost, quality, and efficiency of middle mile operations, including vehicle use, timings, and handover reliability
Modelling estimated route length for Middle Mile Routes by combining real-time geospatial data with historic route and courier intelligence
Partnering with marketplace and ops teams to optimise driver acquisition, targeting, and pricing for the middle mile
Optimising pitstop expansion in line with volume growth, capacity, and service levels
Modelling pitstop-level LTV and unit economics to support capital investment and performance tracking
Collaborating with other data scientists to support geo-sequencing, zone design, and integration with routing models
Act as a thought partner for operations, commercial, and finance leads, bringing a scientific lens to planning and network growth


Who Will Thrive in this role?


2+ years of experience in data science, with experience delivering models into production
Strong experience with Python and SQL
Strong foundations in statistics and probability, with experience applying them in operational and/or financial contexts
Comfort working in ambiguity and navigating messy or incomplete data
Effective communication skills — you can explain technical results clearly to non-technical audiences
Comfort working across functions and disciplines to drive impact


Who Thrives at Relay?

Relayers share core traits, captured in our guiding principles, ""The Relay Edge"":


Aim with Precision: You define problems clearly and measure your impact meticulously.
Play to Win: You chase bold bets, tackle the hard stuff, and view constraints as fuel, not friction.
1% Better Every Day: You believe that small, consistent improvements lead to exponential growth. You move quickly, deliver results, and learn from every experience.
All In, All the Time: You show up and step up. You take ownership from start to finish and do what it takes to deliver when it counts.
People-Powered Greatness: You invest in your teammates. You give and receive feedback with care and candour. You build trust through high standards and shared success.
Grow the Whole Pie: You seek out win-win solutions for merchants, couriers, and our customers, because when they thrive, so do we.


Compensation & Benefits


Generous equity, richer than 99% of European startups, with annual top-ups to share Relay’s success.
Private health & dental coverage, so comprehensive you’d need to be a partner at a Magic Circle law firm to match it.
25 days of holidays
Enhanced parental leave.
Hardware of your choice.
Extensive perks (gym subsidies, cycle-to-work, Friday office lunch, covered Uber home and dinner for late nights, and more).

What’s a good bet in this market though? 




You’re sensible and you likely realise that the market is due a correction and that the tide will go out again. Yet…AI is only going to get better and some of today's innovators are standing on solid ground. 




Some signs of a healthy startup might look like; 




Funding - to an extent although there is a lot of money being thrown at anything AI
Paying customers - this would be better
Enterprise customers - better yet 
Clear vision for what their product is and who it serves. Endless pivots are exhausting
Balance - Trying to outwork your competitors is not a moat despite what the people who drank the San Fran Kool-Aid will have you believe 
Experienced Founders - Working with people who have done it before is a totally different experience than joining first time founders
Strong team - careful hires and a great culture help this business to outperform their competitors without working everyone into the ground. It is a marathon not a sprint. Better yet run a relay whilst your competitors are running around like headless chickens. 
Room for innovation and experimentation. Just because they have a north star does not stop this team from trying new things. Turning ideas into experiments has already unlocked a new revenue stream. What could you bring to the mix? 




Team SEEKR are currently working with a Series-A funded start up (with growing ARR) who embody a lot of the points above. If you want to work with all the toys in a room full of grownups then this could be the role for you.




FAQs




What does it pay? Up to £100 000 on the base + Equity 
Can I work remotely? They have a London office, spend two days a week there and like the benefits of working in person. But if you live in the UK and London would be a stretch as a commute get in touch anyway. Also they are open to periods of remote working. Couple of weeks abroad outside of school holiday madness? Doable.

We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

The Role

We are looking for a Research Analyst to join us on our mission to turn insight into impact. This role is for someone who is passionate about understanding people and driven to find the ""why"" behind their behaviour. You will help us solve some of the biggest questions of our customer base - from understanding pain points of NPS Detractors to uncovering new opportunities for growth across our verticals.

Your work won't just live in a report; it will be a catalyst for change. You will shape the conversation and illuminate the path forward, helping to translate complex data into smart decisions that directly influence how Deliveroo wins.

What You'll Be Doing


Go deep into the data, applying your quantitative skills to connect what customers say with what they do. You'll use a wide range of data sources, with a strong focus on SQL, Python or R to link research findings with our internal performance data.
Champion the customer, focusing your analysis on improving key experience metrics like NPS and Brand Preference to drive meaningful, measurable change across the business.
Tell compelling stories with data, transforming complex analysis into clear and persuasive narratives that inspire confident action from our product, marketing, and commercial teams.


What You’ll Bring


You hold yourself to the highest standards. You have strong quantitative skills and are confident interrogating behavioural trends to find the real story in the data. Your work is rigorous, thoughtful, and a source of truth.
You are deeply curious and proactive. You don't just answer the questions you're given; you look around corners to find the ones we haven't thought to ask yet. You thrive in a fast-paced environment and take full ownership of the quality and influence of your insights.
You see technology not as a replacement for thinking, but as a partner to amplify it. You are excited by the potential of AI and other emerging technologies to help us spot hidden patterns and ask deeper, more creative questions.
You understand that insights only have value when they are shared and understood. You are a clear and confident communicator who can build trusted partnerships and help guide stakeholders through complexity.


This role operates under Deliveroo’s hybrid working policy (three days per week in our London HQ). Occasional travel to key global markets — including the UAE and France — will be required.

Benefits And Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer many great benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation. We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.

Disseminate scientific insights and methods to engage with stakeholders, customers, the scientific community - representing the team at international conferences and industry events.
Collaborate across scientific and technical domains through working with other climate and geospatial scientists co-develop integrated storm risk (hazard and loss) models


What You'll Gain


Collaboration with a dynamic, interdisciplinary science team- bringing together expertise in scientific software engineering, loss modelling, geospatial analysis, remote sensing, hazard modelling, and machine learning.
Growth in independent project leadership, with opportunities to manage and deliver your own initiatives from concept to completion.
Cross-functional collaboration with teams across the business, helping shape innovative science products tailored to customer needs
Hands-on experience in production-grade software development.




ESSENTIAL SKILLS


PhD or equivalent experience in climate science, hazard modelling or statistical analysis.
Experience leveraging scientific computing techniques using Python in a cloud/remote environment.

We’re on a mission to help the hospitality industry double their profitability, reduce their carbon footprint, and create better working environments for their teams.

Our CEO, Conor, founded and scaled Mad Egg - one of the fastest-growing restaurant groups in Ireland. After years of juggling “market-leading” systems, spreadsheets, and paper printouts, he set out to build the solution he wished he had from day one: Nory.

Nory is an all-knowing restaurant management system. It combines real-time data with AI predictive analytics to help restaurants operate with consistency, certainty and profitability. From food prep to forecasting, Nory puts operators in control of their margins.

Now, with demand growing faster than we imagined - and a recent Series A led by Accel - we’re scaling fast. We’ve grown to a team of 50+ across Ireland, the UK and Spain, and we’re just getting started. We’re now looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join our Data team.

Please note you must have the right to work in the UK/EU to be considered for this role.

What you’ll be doing

This role is ideal for a senior independent doer, someone who has owned the entire ML lifecycle and is ready to ship meaningful, production-grade ML systems from scratch. This is not a research or experimentation role; it's about building systems that work in the real world and move the needle on customer outcomes and business impact.


Own the end-to-end development of machine learning systems, from business problem formulation and algorithm design through to deployment and monitoring in production
Collaborate with product managers and engineers to define KPIs, design data flows, and embed algorithms in product features
Apply best-in-class ML practices with clear problem framing, model evaluation, experimentation, and observability—to deliver real-world impact
Independently lead the development of models across the platform acting as the primary ML owner and act as the primary ML owner; from data access and cleaning to modelling and integration
Work autonomously while contributing to a culture of collaboration, shared learning, and continuous improvement
Actively participate in peer reviews, team rituals, and cross-functional discovery, sharing insight and offering help where needed


What you’ll bring


Background: Master's Degree or higher in a STEM subject, with a significant statistics component
Full Lifecycle Ownership: You have at least 3 -5 years of experience taking ML systems from idea through to production in a commercial setting - repeatedly and successfully. You’re confident in owning the process independently, from problem formulation to monitoring impact in production
Technical Proficiency: Strong Python and experience with ML libraries (e.g., Scikitlearn, Pandas, LightGBM), plus working knowledge of cloud infrastructure and data tools (Snowflake, DBT, Omni)
Structured Thinking: You use a clear and repeatable process to approach ML problems, including problem formulation, KPI definition, and experimental design
Rigour & Impact: You apply rigorous statistical and experimental thinking, and can demonstrate how your work has driven measurable business outcomes
Collaboration: You thrive in highly collaborative environments, communicate clearly, and offer help where needed to improve team outcomes
Startup mindset: You thrive in fast-paced environments, move quickly, and take initiative to maintain momentum and resolve issues efficiently. You are comfortable with ambiguity and multitask effectively while delivering real impact


Nice-to-have:


You have worked in smaller data teams with a high ownership culture
You have worked on B2B SaaS AI products


What you’ll get in return:

💰 Competitive Salary

📈 Equity at our Series A valuation

🌴 35 days of paid leave per year (including bank holidays)

🏥 Comprehensive private health insurance

🍼 Enhanced parental leave and baby loss support

📚 Learning & development culture – €1000 personal annual budget + quarterly book budget

🖥️ €250 home office workspace budget

🎯 Regular team offsites & socials

👏 And much more

How we work

Our vision is to build a better future for the restaurant industry.

One where operators are in control, margins are stronger, and frontline teams can build careers they’re proud of. To get there, we move fast, stay focused, and hold ourselves to a high bar. Our values guide how we work, grow, and win – together.

These are the values we live by:


We serve up impact with a side of profit


We prioritise work that delivers real financial results for our restaurant partners.


We prioritise speed of service


We move fast, unblock quickly, and deliver with urgency.


We act like owners

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

At Artisan, we're creating AI Employees, called Artisans, and software which is sleek, easy to use, and replaces the endless stack of point solutions. We're starting with outbound sales and our AI BDR, Ava. Our platform contains every tool needed for outbound sales - B2B data, AI email sequences, deliverability optimization tools and so much more.

We're growing very rapidly and recently raised a $25M Series A round from top investors. We are looking for superstars to join us on our rocketship growth as we relentlessly work towards building a multi-billion dollar company.

About The Role

We're not just shipping AI products—we're building ones that learn and improve autonomously. We’re looking for a Growth ML & Experimentation Engineer to build Ava’s adaptive growth brain: systems that run millions of microtests and optimize outbound performance across companies, personas, and industries.

Think of this role as creating the “growth hacker” mind inside our AI BDR—combining A/B testing, reinforcement learning, and control systems at scale.

You’ll be building an AI that adapts itself to every persona, every market, and every trend—without needing to be told. This isn’t growth hacking for a website. It’s evolution for an AI employee.

What You'll Do


Design and implement automated experimentation systems (A/Z testing, multivariate optimization, Bayesian exploration, etc).
Build dynamic systems that continuously learn from open/response rates, meetings booked, and downstream metrics.
Create reinforcement loops and scoring models to help Ava adjust tone, targeting, and strategies in real-time.
Work closely with product to embed experimentation directly into the AI-user experience.
Develop tools to visualize and interpret campaign intelligence for internal teams and end users.


What You Bring


3–6+ years of experience in applied ML, ideally focused on growth, optimization, or adaptive systems.
Experience with online experimentation frameworks (A/B testing infra, bandits, causal inference, etc).
Strong Python and data engineering skills; comfortable working across pipelines, APIs, and backend systems.
Experience working with outbound or marketing funnel data is a major plus.
Passion for building intelligent systems that get better every day, without human micromanagement.


Why Join Us


Build the future of work by pioneering a new AI-native product category.
Collaborate with a mission-driven, ambitious, and high-caliber team.
Competitive salary, generous equity, and full benefits.
Regular company off-sites and team events.
Fast-moving culture where you'll ship meaningful work every week.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations

Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

About The Job

Our Hubs are a crucial part of how we innovate, improving performance across every Sanofi department and providing a springboard for the amazing work we do. Build a career and you can be part of transforming our business while helping to change millions of lives.

Sanofi’s mission is to chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives. Sanofi is a company that’s on the rise. We are expanding in multiple directions, across borders and, most of all, in the way we think. At Sanofi, we’re building a team of brilliant individuals to drive the success of a new healthcare business to transform healthcare for all. People are the most critical ingredient to our success.

Sanofi's General Medicines Digital Healthcare Team seeks a skilled and driven Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning (ML) Lead to drive and support the development and launch of innovative digital care and life management programs targeting diabetes and other chronic conditions. We are building a comprehensive digital health platform that empowers patients with chronic conditions and their informal caregivers to manage health journeys more effectively together. Our platform combines multiple modular services into a seamless ecosystem that bridges the gap between clinical care and daily life management.

As a Data Science, AI, and ML Lead on Sanofi's General Medicines Digital Healthcare Team, you will play a crucial role in leading the technical design and development of the data management, advanced analytics, and AI/ML capabilities of our consumer-centric digital health platform. In this role, you will leverage advanced mathematical and statistical methodologies to extract meaningful insights from diverse data sources, develop predictive models, and create AI-driven solutions that improve health outcomes and overall quality of life for patients with chronic conditions and their caregivers.

This role requires strong data engineering and software development expertise combined with an understanding of healthcare data standards and privacy and security requirements.

You will ultimately be responsible for the development and implementation of consumer-centric and healthcare professional-focused digital tools aimed at enhancing medication adherence and achieving optimal health outcomes.

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

A Little Bit About Habanero

Habanero is a Canadian consulting company with offices in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg. We are passionate about helping people and organizations thrive. We believe that every organization can be exceptional, and we help to humanize the world of work through the creation of modern workplaces and the cultural, communication, collaboration and content experiences that power them. Our solutions are globally recognized, and we have consecutively ranked as one of Canada's best places to work for the last 14 years.

The best kind of work

Habanero is an organization where people who are creative, hard-working, friendly, honest and open come together to do great work. We have a shared passion for solving complex issues that will benefit other people and organizations. We only hire people we can count on, so you can be certain that you are joining a team of happy and competent team members. We service our clients and projects across Canadian time zones and consultants are resourced on cross-regional teams.

Supporting Each Other In Personal Growth

We are a lattice organization, meaning that there is no traditional hierarchy. There is no typical boss, and you don’t report to a manager. Instead, we have a more holistic approach to mentorship – we offer employee journey coaches who are there to help you with all things career and life. We believe it’s up to you to make the most out of your career, and we are here to support and encourage you every step of the way.

A diverse culture of clever humans

At Habanero, we celebrate diversity and inclusivity. We are committed to creating and supporting equal employment opportunities regardless of age, race, ancestry, ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status or disability. We have included a personalized submission field in our application form to provide an additional opportunity for you to tell your story outside of the traditional resume and cover letter.

Compensation

Our compensation package includes a technology allowance, a wellness allowance, flexible work hours and location, health and dental coverage, a health spending account and RRSP matching. We also enjoy smaller perks like free snacks and drinks and group lunches where you can reconnect with your team after a long week. There are training and development opportunities for those who wish to continue evolving their skills. All employees start at three weeks of vacation.

Bringing life to work

Everyone at Habanero probably has their own story around this, but it's probably safe to say that it starts with people feeling like they can bring their whole selves to work. The cornerstone idea is that we want to support people having great lives, not just great work lives (we can't say our relationship begins at 9:00 and ends at 5:00). Other things we've heard make the difference for Habs:


People starting their careers get to jump in and gain experience right away
Employee journey support system (career coach)
The culture of trust, transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, autonomy... to name a few
The awesome people that work here (of course)
Flexible work schedule
Training and development opportunities when we can support them


We recently asked Habs to share what they feel makes us one of the Best Places to Work in Canada and the loudest response was 'our people' (with 'our teams' and 'balance' not far behind). So, if this sounds like something you want to be a part of, and you have the skills and experience to contribute, then we want to meet you!

Please note that every incoming Habanero employee is required to complete and clear a criminal record check, employment verification, and COVID-19 vaccination status confirmation in compliance with our clients’ policies. By applying, you acknowledge that if hired by Habanero you agree to complete background checks and COVID-19 vaccination status confirmation and you don't foresee any concerns in regard to obtaining cleared results.

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.




About the Role:




We're seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to bridge the gap between our data products, data science insights and production systems. You'll be responsible for taking ML models from concept to production, building robust MLOps infrastructure, and ensuring our machine learning systems operate reliably at scale. This role focuses on the engineering aspects of ML design, deployment, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure.




What you will do:




Design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion to model serving
Build automated model training, validation, and deployment workflows using CI/CD best practices
Develop and maintain MLOps infrastructure for model versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment
Create robust monitoring and alerting systems for model performance, data drift, and system health
Optimize model inference performance and cost for production workloads
Collaborate with our Data Engineers to design and implement feature stores and feature pipelines
Develop automated data quality checks and validation frameworks for ML pipelines
Build scalable feature engineering workflows that support both batch and real-time inference
Implement data versioning and lineage tracking for reproducible ML workflows
Partner with Software Data Scientists to productionize research models and experiments
Implement frameworks for model evaluation and gradual rollouts
Design automated retraining pipelines and model refresh strategies
Establish best practices for model governance, documentation, and compliance
Work closely with Software Engineers to integrate ML capabilities into existing applications
Contribute to architectural decisions for scalable, maintainable ML systems
Participate in code reviews, documentation, and knowledge sharing across teams
Mentor junior engineers on ML engineering best practices




The right person for this role will have:




3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, MLOps, or related fields
Strong proficiency in Python for ML development and automation
Solid SQL skills for data manipulation and analysis
Hands-on experience with AWS or other cloud platforms (Azure, or GCP) and their ML services
Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for ML workloads
Proficiency with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and MLOps tools
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code principles
Databricks experience is a plus
Experience with feature engineering at scale and feature store implementations
Understanding of model monitoring, observability, and production ML challenges
Knowledge of data quality frameworks and automated testing for ML systems
Familiarity with distributed computing frameworks (Databricks or Sagemaker) for large-scale ML
Experience with experiment tracking and model versioning tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases, etc.)




Bonus points if you have:




Master's or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or related quantitative field Experience with real-time ML inference and streaming data pipelines
Knowledge of AutoML platforms and automated hyperparameter tuning
Familiarity with model compression, quantization, and edge deployment Experience with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud ML architectures
Contributions to open-source ML tools or platforms




Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
4 weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 days of the year




Application process:

Please submit your resume highlighting relevant experience and include a cover letter explaining your interest in the specific role
Provide links to relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or publications
Be prepared to discuss technical projects and problem-solving approaches in interviews

A Little Bit About Habanero

Habanero is a Canadian consulting company with offices in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg. We are passionate about helping people and organizations thrive. We believe that every organization can be exceptional, and we help to humanize the world of work through the creation of modern workplaces and the cultural, communication, collaboration and content experiences that power them. Our solutions are globally recognized, and we have consecutively ranked as one of Canada's best places to work for the last 14 years.

The best kind of work

Habanero is an organization where people who are creative, hard-working, friendly, honest and open come together to do great work. We have a shared passion for solving complex issues that will benefit other people and organizations. We only hire people we can count on, so you can be certain that you are joining a team of happy and competent team members. We service our clients and projects across Canadian time zones and consultants are resourced on cross-regional teams.

Supporting Each Other In Personal Growth

We are a lattice organization, meaning that there is no traditional hierarchy. There is no typical boss, and you don’t report to a manager. Instead, we have a more holistic approach to mentorship – we offer employee journey coaches who are there to help you with all things career and life. We believe it’s up to you to make the most out of your career, and we are here to support and encourage you every step of the way.

A diverse culture of clever humans

At Habanero, we celebrate diversity and inclusivity. We are committed to creating and supporting equal employment opportunities regardless of age, race, ancestry, ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status or disability. We have included a personalized submission field in our application form to provide an additional opportunity for you to tell your story outside of the traditional resume and cover letter.

Compensation

Our compensation package includes a technology allowance, a wellness allowance, flexible work hours and location, health and dental coverage, a health spending account and RRSP matching. We also enjoy smaller perks like free snacks and drinks and group lunches where you can reconnect with your team after a long week. There are training and development opportunities for those who wish to continue evolving their skills. All employees start at three weeks of vacation.

Bringing life to work

Everyone at Habanero probably has their own story around this, but it's probably safe to say that it starts with people feeling like they can bring their whole selves to work. The cornerstone idea is that we want to support people having great lives, not just great work lives (we can't say our relationship begins at 9:00 and ends at 5:00). Other things we've heard make the difference for Habs:


People starting their careers get to jump in and gain experience right away
Employee journey support system (career coach)
The culture of trust, transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, autonomy... to name a few
The awesome people that work here (of course)
Flexible work schedule
Training and development opportunities when we can support them


We recently asked Habs to share what they feel makes us one of the Best Places to Work in Canada and the loudest response was 'our people' (with 'our teams' and 'balance' not far behind). So, if this sounds like something you want to be a part of, and you have the skills and experience to contribute, then we want to meet you!

Please note that every incoming Habanero employee is required to complete and clear a criminal record check, employment verification, and COVID-19 vaccination status confirmation in compliance with our clients’ policies. By applying, you acknowledge that if hired by Habanero you agree to complete background checks and COVID-19 vaccination status confirmation and you don't foresee any concerns in regard to obtaining cleared results.

Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. For over five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck, Rakovina Therapeutics, and ImmVue Therapeutics.




You will help identify, clean, prepare, and test datasets; run experiments to evaluate new architectures and tune hyperparameters; continually improve the robustness and efficiency of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. In this process, you will have the opportunity to build your skills by collaborating with our team of accomplished ML scientists and chemists. Software engineering expertise is required, as well as experience with deep learning and generative models; knowledge of chemistry and pharmacology is preferred be not required.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Shaping Spare's Strategy with Data Insights: Working with leadership to shape strategic decisions across the organization through data-driven insights.




This role follows a hybrid schedule. We require team members to be in the office on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with the option to work remotely on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Process Improvement and Alignment: Gather feedback to enhance data processes, participate in planning and alignment meetings across teams, and collaborate with Data Engineering to improve infrastructure, models, and pipelines.
Governance and Advocacy: Ensure data integrity, privacy compliance, and maintain clear documentation, while championing data-driven decision-making and fostering a data-centric culture across the organization.




Key Results:

Improved Customer Satisfaction: Measured through qualitative feedback (pulse updates gathered by Partner Success Managers) and potentially quantitative measures like NPS scores related to data support.
Effective Internal Support: Measured through qualitative feedback (e.g., retrospectives with internal teams) and quantitative metrics like internal NPS scores for data support, and tracking usage/adoption of data tools (e.g., Daily Active Users on Metabase dashboards).
Timely & Accurate Data Delivery: Successfully managing and fulfilling the backlog of internal and external data requests according to agreed-upon priorities and timelines.
Actionable Insights: Delivering analyses and insights that demonstrably inform customer operations or internal decision-making.




Must-Have:

Intermediate to Senior-level expertise in data science.
Strong technical ability in data analysis, insight generation, and working with large datasets.
Experience with SQL, Pythona and other programming languages for data manipulation and analysis.
Proficiency with BI tools (e.g., Metabase, Mixpanel, Tableau, PowerBI, or similar).
Excellent communication and presentation skills, with the ability to explain complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences, especially customers.
Proven ability to manage customer relationships and act in a consultative capacity.
Demonstrates Customer Obsession and the ability to Execute with Urgency (Spare Guiding Principles).




Nice-to-Have:

An interest in Spare's mission and the transit industry.
Experience working in a B2B/SaaS startup environment.




Don’t meet every single requirement?

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale
