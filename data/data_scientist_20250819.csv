About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics. The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

We believe that making the best decisions means looking at all the facts - a near-impossible task in our era of information overload. To fix this, we are building the next generation of machine learning software. Powered by generative AI, our algorithms analyze key information sources and provide comprehensive, factual answers for even your most complex queries.

We believe that the transformative impact of generative AI will be only realized by those willing to take on the world's biggest information challenges. To make this future come true, we deploy our longstanding expertise in reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

We are scientists. Builders. Entrepreneurs. We spearheaded many of AI's most impactful applications. We led teams at Google, DeepMind, and EY Parthenon. We now bridge cutting-edge AI research and the biopharma industry.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning engineer with a strong track record working on applied ML. Bonus points if you have worked in the life sciences. You'll play a central role in defining and building our ML platform, enabling cutting-edge AI agents that excel at discovering and organizing knowledge. Your work will help lay the foundation for a new way of working with data.

If you are passionate about applying AI to real-world problems, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and are excited about contributing to the growth of an ambitious startup, we'd love to hear from you.

What We'd Love You To Do (and Love Doing)

Your day to day work will mainly include building text based generative AI applications end-to-end with a strong focus on benchmarking and experimentation with models, prompts and system design. Also there are ample opportunities to dive deeper into topics, such as synthetic data generation, model distillation, training embedding models for retrieval, etc.

Am I a good fit?

Ask yourself the following questions:


How does a transformer work?
What is an embedding?
What is a dataclass in Python?
What is a quick way to share an interactive demo with colleagues?


If you find these questions straightforward and can explain at least three of the answers clearly, you're likely a good fit for this role.

We'd love to see


A Master's degree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering or a similar quantitative field — or equivalent practical experience. Bonus if you have NLP or reinforcement learning experience
Proven experience implementing practical ML algorithms and scaling them to millions of datapoints
3+ years of experience developing in Python
Familiarity with at least one ML framework such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or similar
Bonus: Experience applying AI to the life sciences or related fields
Bonus: Familiarity with cloud tooling around one or more of CI/CD, dockerization, model serving, data processing


We're hiring across experience levels, from junior to senior, and will calibrate the role and responsibilities based on your background and expertise.

What We Offer

We're building a high-impact, mission-driven company — and we want our team to share in that success. Here's what we offer:


An amazing team - work with curious, ambitious people who genuinely care about solving meaningful problems
Competitive Salary tailored to your experience and the role level
Equity / Stock Options — meaningful ownership in the company's future
Generous Paid Time Off — including 27 vacation days
On-site Work Arrangements with Flexibility — on-site first culture with regular days for remote work
Learning & Development Budget — for books, courses, or conferences that help you grow
Fast Growth Environment — be part of shaping both the technology and the company from the ground up
Regular Team Retreats — we bring the team together at least once a year to collaborate and have fun


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

Evaluate and fine‑tune state‑of‑the‑art ASR, LLM and TTS models—both commercial and open‑source—and integrate the best performers into production.
Optimise inference through quantisation, distillation, hardware‑aware graph compilation and reinforcement‑learning‑based tuning.
Expose scalable APIs & micro‑services with Python/FastAPI, gRPC or WebSocket streaming, backed by robust observability and autoscaling.
Own deployment across cloud and on‑prem environments, collaborating on containerisation (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes) and CI/CD workflows.
Stay ahead of the curve by tracking research, running experiments and sharing learnings with the broader team.


What We’re Looking For


Python Engineering: 5+ years writing production‑grade, well‑tested Python; deep familiarity with async, typing and performance profiling
Speech / Audio: Hands‑on experience building real‑time ASR, TTS, voice chat or streaming audio products
LLM Tooling: Fine‑tuning, prompt design, evaluation, retrieval‑augmented generation; familiarity with frameworks such as Openpipe/ART, LangChain, LlamaIndex or similar
Systems & MLOps: Containerisation, GPU scheduling, observability, DevOps on GCP or AWS; infrastructure‑as‑code principles
API Design: Building and maintaining high‑throughput REST/gRPC/FastAPI services; securing and monitoring them in production


Bonus Points


Model compression expertise (quantisation, pruning, ONNX/TensorRT)
Knowledge of audio and acoustics
Experience with reinforcement‑learning‑from‑human‑feedback (RLHF) or direct preference optimisation
Contributions to open‑source ML/speech projects (share your GitHub!)
Familiarity with GPU inference servers (Triton, KServe) or distributed compute frameworks (Ray)

Requirements

Location: Only for applicants from Germany

Language: German - Fluent, English - Fluent

Your Toolbelt


3+ years of hands-on experience in Data Science
You’re comfortable working with large-scale, messy datasets – even the kind that don’t fit into memory
For you state-of-the-art-methods are not just the methods everybody use. You are not afraid to search for answers in scientific literature.
Strong mathematical intuition – you don’t just apply models; you want to understand why they work
You follow best practices by default, and know when it’s time to question them


Your Tools


Python – comfy with pandas, scikit-learn & friends
Data Science basics – from feature engineering to model validation
SQL – joins, aggregations, subqueries? No problem
Docker & Linux – smooth setup and deployment
AI/ML – real models, not just slide decks
Git – because version control is second nature


Bonus Skills (nice to have):

Apache Spark / Kubernetes / Prefect, Airflow or similar / Torch, VLLM, or LLM-related tooling / pydantic.ai or similar / Shell scripting

Activities

Is your idea of fun wrangling messy data, debugging ML pipelines, and running experiments that actually tell you something? Do you know that correlation ≠ causation, and that pandas aren't just cute animals? 🐼 If your heart beats faster for code, queries, and questions, keep reading. At smartclip, we’re on the hunt for a Data Scientist who’s less into dashboards for the sake of dashboards, and more into uncovering what really matters behind the metrics.


Explore terabytes of real-world data, not toy datasets
Work on questions that don’t have answers on StackOverflow (yet)
Build and improve data products and ML models with a team of domain experts
Have the freedom to use the right tool for the right job, not just the fashionable one


Team

🤝 We believe in flat hierarchies and fast decision-making processes.

With over 30 million automated calls handled, 4 million hours saved in contact centres, and 99.9% uptime, their no-code platform is powering the future of voice AI.




Backed by the investors behind Facebook and GroupOn and trusted by 1,000+ companies, they enable enterprises to deploy multilingual, human-like voice agents at scale.




Role Overview:




The ML Engineer will join the founding team, shaping real-time, low-latency speech systems from the ground up. This is a hands-on, architecture-level role - building end-to-end voice pipelines that combine ASR, LLMs, and TTS, and scaling them across mission-critical environments.




Key Responsibilities:




Design and deploy real-time ASR → LLM → TTS pipelines optimised for speed and naturalness
Fine-tune and integrate best-in-class open-source and commercial models across ASR, TTS, and LLMs
Optimise inference performance using techniques like quantisation, distillation, and RL-based tuning
Build high-throughput, low-latency APIs using Python, FastAPI, gRPC, and WebSocket streaming
Own deployment workflows across cloud and on-prem, collaborating on Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD
Stay ahead of the curve — run experiments, track new research, and help keep the team at the cutting edge




Qualifications:




Deep experience in Python.
Proven hands-on work with real-time ASR, TTS, voice chat, or streaming audio systems
Familiarity with LLM tooling - prompt design, fine-tuning, RAG, and frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or OpenPipe




You’ll push the boundaries of what voice AI can do in production - balancing model quality, latency, and scalability - while working across product, infra, and research to ship new capabilities into the hands of real users.




If you want to build the voice layer of enterprise AI - and work at the frontier of real-time language, speech, and systems - we’d love to hear from you.

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

You would be joining a flexible and dynamic team and your role will include:


selecting features, building and optimizing classifiers using machine learning techniques
processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
deep dive on the problems using SQL and scripting languages to drive solutions leveraging Statistical Analysis
implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone. Our recruitment process is free from discrimination of any kind — including on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

Production Integration: Work closely with backend and infra teams to integrate AI models into real products


Own AI Quality: Create tools and dashboards, CI hooks, or human-in-the-loop flows that ensure reliable auditable & explainable AI behavior at scale



Requirements



2–5 years' experience in AI/ML engineering**,** with a focus on LLMs, RAG, or NLP systems in a high-paced environment (e.g., start-up, scale-up)


Solid Python skills and hands-on with modern AI tooling (e.g., RAG-optimization, vector data bases, evaluation tools etc.)


Familiarity with prompt engineering, embeddings, and evaluating LLM outputs in production


Proven track record shipping in fast iteration loops with unsolved challenges in highly dynamic environment


Proactive, curious, and user-oriented—you want to build highly autonomous, scalable and auditable agentic systems with the best tools and frameworks in the market





Bonus Points For





Experience with AWS, GCP, or Azure for model deployment or vector storage - we will set-up AI agents in a multi-cloud environment


Familiarity with LLM finetuning or low-rank adaptation (LoRA)


Experience with insurance, regtech, or other high-compliance domains





Your First 30 Days





🤖 Ship an Agent: Build or refine an internal AI agent for a specific task (e.g. claim triage, document QA)


🔍 RAG Evaluation: Benchmark and compare two RAG pipelines using automatic and LLM-based evals


📈 Build Eval Dashboard: Make model quality and failure cases transparent across the team


🛠 Optimize Retrieval: Improve embedding relevance or chunking strategies for better grounding

Wir sind eine inhabergeführte Werbeagentur mit digitalen Wurzeln und über 250 Mitarbeiter*innen an 6 Standorten. Gegründet 2004. Weit, weit im Osten und mittlerweile im Westen angekommen. In Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart und Gütersloh. Wir bieten Konzeption, Kreation, Redaktion, Organisation und Entwicklung. Unsere Kunden: Ministerien und Verbände, Hidden Champions und die Leuchttürme der deutschen Wirtschaft.

Wir entwickeln Kampagnen, digitale Plattformen und redaktionelle Konzepte - von der strategischen Kernidee bis zur technischen Umsetzung.

Unser Credo: Wenn der Inhalt nicht hält, was die Packung verspricht, taugt beides nichts.

Was zu tun ist.

Organisieren, briefen und beraten. Aber vor allem: zuhören, verstehen, fragen. So lernst du am schnellsten. Und am meisten. Vom Geschäft. Und von den Kolleg:innen. Du wirst komplexe Themen recherchieren.

Überzeugende Präsentationen schreiben. Und wenn‘s gut läuft, sogar eigene kleine Projekte übernehmen. Du arbeitest selbständig, aber nie allein. Und am Ende hast du vielleicht so überzeugt, dass wir dich übernehmen.

Was du mitbringst.

Du hast dein Studium abgeschlossen. Politik oder Soziologie. Was mit Medien. Oder etwas ganz anderes. Hauptsache: Du hast ein ausgeprägtes Interesse an Politik und ihren Abläufen und bist ein Organisationstalent.

Du hast Erfahrungen in einer Agentur gesammelt. Vielleicht sogar im politischen Betrieb. Ministerien, Verbände, NGOs. Praktikum,Nebenjob, Ehrenamt, so was.

Du hast Lust, dich mit komplexen Themen und Prozessen auseinander zu setzen und kannst komplizierte Sachverhalte auch auf wenig Platz pointiert zusammenfassen, so dass sie jeder versteht. Du bist sicher im Ausdruck. Mündlich wie schriftlich.

Du organisierst gerne, bist ein Teamplayer und hast Lust darauf, die Umsetzung unserer Kampagnen aktiv voranzutreiben, von der ersten Konzeptidee bis zum fertigen Produkt.

Wen wir suchen.

Eine/n Trainee in der Beratung (w/m/d/k.A.). In Berlin. Ab sofort.

Was wir bieten.

Komplexe Inhalte. Klare Kommunikation. Relevante Botschaften. Ein Umfeld aus Lehren und Lernen. Mit jeder Menge Verantwortung.

Fähige Kolleg:innen zum Zusammen-Lernen. Flache Hierarchien, die nicht vom Status, sondern von Können, Erfahrung und Verantwortung bestimmt sind.

Was, wenn's passt?

Dann sollten wir uns kennenlernen.

Wir freuen uns über jede Bewerbung von qualifizierten Menschen. Jeder geschlechtlichen und sexuellen Identität. Jeden Alters. Von Bewerbenden mit Migrationshintergrund, People of Colour und/oder Menschen mit Behinderungen. Wiedereinsteiger:innen. Eltern. Quereinsteiger:innen. Alle sind bei uns gleichermaßen willkommen.

Schick uns gerne deine Bewerbungsunterlagen und lass uns wissen, wann du frühestens einsteigen kannst und wie deine Gehaltsvorstellungen sind. Wir freuen uns auf dich.

Deine Ansprechpartnerin.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams.

Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Role Overview:

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer centric decisions through flawless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalization.

What you will be doing:

You’ll join a London-based agile team building and supporting data science products that drive business impact across PlayStation. You’ll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to serve teams such as marketing, operations, engineering, product planning, R&D, and finance.

We are hiring for two vital teams within Data Science:

Forecasting & Value Models:

With a focus on forecasting and value modelling, you will help PlayStation quantify and anticipate the future value of our customer base, powering commercial decisions that affect strategy and planning. Your work will enable the business to better understand not just who our customers are, but how their behaviours translate into long-term financial outcomes.

In this role, you will:


Partner with commercial, finance, and analytics teams to translate business requirements into actionable products aiding understanding of customer value
Build and refine predictive models focused on forecasting customer lifetime value (CLV) and a deep understanding of our players’ monetisation behaviours
Build and deliver reusable data science products in close partnership with engineering
Clearly communicate modelling rationale, assumptions, and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Help drive data literacy across the business
Collaborate with a high-performing team of data scientists to apply insights and drive innovation throughout the company.


Growth Modelling:

As a Data Scientist focused on growth modelling, you’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams to prototype, develop and validate models that inform marketing, customer lifecycle, and commercial strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation understands its customers and prioritises high-impact engagement opportunities.

In this role, you will:


Work as part of a cross-functional team to understand business needs and translate them into testable modelling hypotheses
Prototype and validate growth-focused models, including churn and purchase propensity, audience segmentation, uplift modelling, and customer lifecycle scoring
Support experimentation programs with actionable model outputs that enable targeted testing and measurable outcomes
Build and deliver reusable data science products in collaboration with analytics and engineering
Clearly communicate your approach and findings to both technical and non-technical partners, building confidence in data-driven solutions
Drive data literacy and model adoption across the business, enabling broader use of predictive insights
Stay up to date with emerging tools, techniques, and technologies to continuously improve modelling practices and business impact


Our data scientists also have dedicated time for self-directed exploration (approximately 10%), giving you the opportunity to investigate new tools, techniques, and ideas that can strengthen our data science capabilities.

What you'll be doing:

You’re someone who’s passionate about turning data into actionable insight — and you bring both the curiosity to explore and the skills to implement. You have the technical depth to work with sophisticated datasets, the communication skills to influence a wide range of teams, and the eye for business to connect data science to commercial growth and operational impact.


Exceptional analytical and critical thinking, with a structured approach to developing and testing hypotheses that drive performance
Strong programming and data skills in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries
Proven academic grounding, typically with a Master’s or PhD in a technical or mathematical field — or equivalent professional experience
Experience applying data science techniques such as supervised/unsupervised learning, segmentation, forecasting, causal inference, and uplift modelling
Demonstrated ability to extract insight from sophisticated, high-volume datasets and apply it to influence commercial or strategic decisions
Strong commercial competence, with a track record of delivering high-value data science solutions that influence business outcomes
Excellent communication skills, able present complex technical work clearly to a range of partners
A collaborative attitude and the ability to align data science work with broader business priorities


Nice to Have:


Experience with data science tooling (e.g., workflow orchestrators like Airflow, feature stores)
Familiarity with visual analytics tools (e.g., Tableau or similar platforms)
Experience in gaming, digital commerce, or subscription services
A personal interest in gaming and the entertainment industry


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)

Type: Full-time

Compensation: Depending on Experience




About Navys




At Navys, we are building the most advanced funds lawyer, ever.




Navys is transforming the fund formation process by combining deep legal expertise with AI. This isn’t another contract review or document summarizer: we are creating the Legal Operating System for funds.




Navys fuses internal legal precision and external regulatory insight into a living system that learns, reasons, and scales with fund professionals.




We are seeking an ambitious Data Scientist to join our team on a full-time basis. This is a unique chance to work alongside experienced private funds lawyers, AI engineers, and innovators in a tech-forward environment. Navys is not just a better tool - it’s a different model of how legal software should be built. You’ll be working on a product that completely reshapes the legal industry.




As our first or one of our first data science hires, you’ll play a foundational role in building AI-driven legal intelligence systems, from data ingestion and modelling through to experimentation and deployment. You’ll work closely with engineering, product, and legal teams to design models and pipelines that power our platform.




What you’ll own (first 12 months)




Design, train, and evaluate machine learning models for legal and regulatory intelligence.
Build robust data pipelines for ingesting, cleaning, and structuring complex legal data.
Collaborate with software engineers to integrate models into production systems.
Partner with legal experts to translate domain knowledge into data features and model architectures.
Develop and maintain model monitoring, evaluation, and retraining workflows.
Contribute to the design of our AI/ML stack and establish best practices for data science across the company.




Must-have technical foundations




Strong proficiency in Python for data science and machine learning.
Experience with NLP, large language models, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Proven track record of building and deploying ML models into production.
Solid understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics.
Familiarity with cloud-based ML services (Azure preferred; AWS acceptable).
Experience working with APIs, databases, and structured/unstructured datasets.
Excellent problem-solving, analytical, and communication skills.
Desire to work in a fast-paced, dynamic start-up environment and a go-getter attitude.




Nice-to-have extras




Experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
Knowledge of Azure AI services (e.g., Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Search).
Background in legal tech, fintech, or another highly regulated domain.
Familiarity with MLOps tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases, Kubeflow).
Understanding of vector databases and semantic search.
Experience with data visualisation libraries (e.g., Plotly, D3.js).






You’ll thrive here if




You are talented, focused, and aligned with our mission - we are building a complex product with innovative technology, so we need driven and dynamic candidates who can rise to the challenge.
You take ownership of problems and run with them—figuring things out with limited direction when needed.
You are a strong communicator who gets your point across clearly, and you’re not afraid to speak up when something needs addressing.
You are independent, flexible, and prepared to take on responsibility early on.
You are prepared to be accountable for—and proud of—the work you do and your contributions to the team.




What we offer




Work with a veteran team of ex-employees of leading law firms, tech companies, and AI labs.
Direct mentorship from senior engineers, private funds lawyers, and product leaders.
5% pension contribution.
25 days holiday.
Private healthcare.

Assisted by Machine Learning and NLP techniques, any company can now benefit from deep insights into markets, well beyond what human analysts can gather and digest in commercially viable time frames.




Since our Series A and B funding rounds in 2022, we have come a long way to now supplying data to multiple industry leading procurement and buyers platforms. Our clients now include multi-billion dollar global conglomerates; their experiences and deep industry insights revealed further efficiency gains within procurement waiting to be unlocked, through a combination of LLM solutions, bespoke classification models, and traditional data science methods, which we are trialing as a new product.




As such, our ‘Blue-Chip’ leadership team are looking for people who want to grow and develop with the company.




About the role

The role will be part of a team to maintain and develop NLP components in our Backend ETL pipeline, enabling our APIs and our native SaaS platform to have real time intelligence into a company's service and product offerings, and how it compares to its competitors within the trends of its market.




Distinct from our competitors, our services do not operate within a static data lake - instead, all of our analysis is performed on the fly, using a free text input provided by the user. You will not be transforming the same batch of data over and over again - you will be working with a dynamic stream of data, and no two days will be the same.




Join the engineering team at a small tech start-up, delivering market-leading supplier discovery intelligence with AI methods;
Working with our Junior Data Scientist to train and deploy in-house NLP models, including but not limited to BERT based text classification, key phrase extraction, and sentiment analysis;
Collaborate with the backend team to deploy and maintain new agentic deep-research and RAG applications for market and company analysis;
Design, build, test, ship, and monitor NLP analysis pipelines;
Create containerised workflows using pre-trained NLP/other ML models; API requests; and mathematical & statistical methods, with particular focus on text embeddings;
Work closely with backend team to architect and manage vector/graph/other databases;
Provide solutions in iterative steps, instead of waiting for a perfect solution;
Take ownership of a knowledge modelling project for information extraction by LLM.




We value cultural fit as much as technical skills. We are a small close-knit team - while everyone carries their own weight, we all share the same ""can-do"" attitude to help each other out as colleagues and friends. We also celebrate diversity in both culture, background and experience, bringing a wide range of perspectives from other industries into our work.




About you

You are a passionate and experienced NLP Data Scientist with a strong background in machine learning and natural language processing. You have a proven track record of developing and deploying NLP models in production environments, and you are excited about the opportunity to work with a dynamic and innovative team.




Key qualifications include:

Strong programming skills in Python and experience with NLP libraries such as Huggingface Transformers, SpaCy, Scikit-learn or NLTK;
Experienced with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch;
Experienced in the iterative cycle of data preparation, training and evaluating NLP models;
Sees it as a challenge to work within resource constraints in order to maintain financial viability of the company;
Strong communication skills and the ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders;
A continued interest in the latest developments in NLP and machine learning, with a self-drive to experiment with new techniques and approaches.




Above all, we treasure people with insatiable curiosity. We treasure people who strive to be a better version of themselves every day, being motivated to find solutions whatever it takes. We believe that investing in an ever-growing individual will yield a better return than hiring a perfect fit.




What we offer

Competitive salary and equity options;
Flexible working hours and remote work options;
Room for personal and professional growth, with a focus on how you want to advance your career;
A friendly and inclusive work environment that is full of fun and camaraderie;
A 9 day fortnight work schedule, allowing you to have a Friday day off every two full-week cycle.
Yes, we do take these time off most if not all the time
No, this is not one of those ""take as much time off as you want"" policies that no one can actually use

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be.

We’re looking for a Founder’s Associate to work directly with our 2x exited Founder and CEO - Harvey Hodd - and Operations Lead to drive business and engineering velocity.

Day 1 Ownership and Execution of key operational tasks across: 




Automation - Architect and build scalable processes that accelerate engineering velocity.

Reasoning by first principles. Can you deconvolute complex scenarios into their foundational truths or parts?




Urgency. We don’t have time to wait, are you comfortable with a high-degree of risk and pressure to move fast. 




Specifics:

£40-60K Salary depending on experience.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions.

A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Your models don't just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you, read on.

AlgaeCal is on the hunt for an Intermediate Data Scientist to develop mathematical algorithms and apply machine learning to analyze business data, test hypotheses, and turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.

This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we're driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world's only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you'll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.

This job might be for you if you've got...


2+ years experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You've built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don't just analyze numbers, you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You've used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that'll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis
Kaggle-level knowledge of artificial intelligence models. And if you think RAG is something you clean your countertops with, this probably isn't the role for you.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it's regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don't just apply models, you understand how they work under the hood
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You've worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You're the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don't just crunch numbers, you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You're proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability
Industry know-how that adds value. If you've got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that's a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI


Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you're nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can't wait to meet you.

Other Qualities You'll Need

At AlgaeCal we're going to insist that you have these 3 qualities:


You're humble—you put the team and others' needs ahead of your own
You're hungry to learn more
You're people smart--in the sense that you're a great teammate


The truth is, if you don't have these qualities you won't last long at AlgaeCal. So if you're missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.

What Will You Earn?

We believe in rewarding top talent. Let's talk about salary once we've had the chance to get to know you better. Rest assured, we're generous and offer above-market pay for the right person. If you bring the skills and experience, we'll make sure the compensation reflects that.

You'll also enjoy the following benefits:


Monthly team events and activities
Flexible Stat Holidays with the option to bank days for later use
Weekly team lunches
Casual dress code
Incredible dog friendly, Yaletown office one block from SkyTrain
Remote working is okay with us too


And above all, you'll join a team that you'll never want to leave. Culture is everything to us. Yes, we work extremely hard to change as many people's lives as possible. But we know how to have fun and reward ourselves too.

At Artisan, we're creating AI Employees, called Artisans, and software which is sleek, easy to use, and replaces the endless stack of point solutions. We're starting with outbound sales and our AI BDR, Ava. Our platform contains every tool needed for outbound sales - B2B data, AI email sequences, deliverability optimization tools and so much more.

We're growing very rapidly and recently raised a $25M Series A round from top investors. We are looking for superstars to join us on our rocketship growth as we relentlessly work towards building a multi-billion dollar company.

About The Role

We're not just shipping AI products—we're building ones that learn and improve autonomously. We’re looking for a Growth ML & Experimentation Engineer to build Ava’s adaptive growth brain: systems that run millions of microtests and optimize outbound performance across companies, personas, and industries.

Think of this role as creating the “growth hacker” mind inside our AI BDR—combining A/B testing, reinforcement learning, and control systems at scale.

You’ll be building an AI that adapts itself to every persona, every market, and every trend—without needing to be told. This isn’t growth hacking for a website. It’s evolution for an AI employee.

What You'll Do


Design and implement automated experimentation systems (A/Z testing, multivariate optimization, Bayesian exploration, etc).
Build dynamic systems that continuously learn from open/response rates, meetings booked, and downstream metrics.
Create reinforcement loops and scoring models to help Ava adjust tone, targeting, and strategies in real-time.
Work closely with product to embed experimentation directly into the AI-user experience.
Develop tools to visualize and interpret campaign intelligence for internal teams and end users.


What You Bring


3–6+ years of experience in applied ML, ideally focused on growth, optimization, or adaptive systems.
Experience with online experimentation frameworks (A/B testing infra, bandits, causal inference, etc).
Strong Python and data engineering skills; comfortable working across pipelines, APIs, and backend systems.
Experience working with outbound or marketing funnel data is a major plus.
Passion for building intelligent systems that get better every day, without human micromanagement.


Why Join Us


Build the future of work by pioneering a new AI-native product category.
Collaborate with a mission-driven, ambitious, and high-caliber team.
Competitive salary, generous equity, and full benefits.
Regular company off-sites and team events.
Fast-moving culture where you'll ship meaningful work every week.

Strong command of algorithms, data structures, and object‑oriented design.
Applied ML Expertise
Detecting & mitigating target leakage, train‑test temporal skew, data drift, and other common pitfalls in building production models.
Translate business objectives into quantifiable ML metrics (e.g., MRR, MAP, precision/recall, AUC, F1, NDCG) and choose appropriate loss functions (e.g., Plackett–Luce, cross‑entropy, focal loss) to optimise them.
High Agency & Ownership Demonstrated ability to identify opportunities, form hypotheses, and drive projects that align with business objectives with minimal supervision.
Communication & Collaboration Clear written/verbal communication and a collaborative mindset.

Nice‑to‑Have


Reinforcement Learning Hands‑on RL experience—especially fine‑tuning LLMs toward verifiable objectives or applying RL/bandits in recommendation and ranking—is a strong plus.
Domain Expertise Background in learning‑to‑rank, recommender systems, conversational agents, or NLP.
Portfolio: Open‑source contributions, Kaggle medals, blogs or peer‑reviewed publications that replicate and extend academic research.
Production ML Ops Experience with Spark, Airflow, Docker/Kubernetes, feature stores, and model observability/monitoring.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

TEAM: SALT MEDIA

LOCATION: TORONTO (HYBRID)

TERM: 6 MONTH CONTRACT

Company Overview

Ready to shape the future of AI-driven advertising and build products that transform how brands connect with audiences? We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our team at Salt Media and be a part of the evolution.

Every day at Salt Media, we’re facilitating more informed, valuable conversations between companies and the people they serve. We’re driven by our mission to “Bring Audiences Home”—helping brands cut through irrelevant noise and connect with people who truly care.

As an AI-driven media agency powered by our own proprietary products, we help clients make smarter, more impactful ad buying decisions while delivering a better experience for brands and consumers alike. Our product suite and unique in-house service models blend the best of data science and marketing, empowering clients to take ownership of their digital media, social buying, and first-party data strategies.

Our Current Product Suite Includes


Podium, our next-gen media mix modelling and measurement platform
Frontrunnr, our automated social boosting and ad optimization platform
Media Mob, our creator discovery platform


…and this is just the beginning. We're constantly ideating and building. As one of our Data Scientists, you'll play a pivotal role not only in shaping and refining these products but also in envisioning and creating the next wave of transformative products that will define our future.

About You

If you’re an engineer who loves building product, has an ownership mentality and is someone who constantly wants to learn and evolve, here are a few reasons why you might be excited to join Salt Media:


Work with Cutting-Edge AI
AI isn’t just a buzzword for us — it’s in our DNA. As a Data Scientist, you’ll engage directly with generative models, ML-driven decision-making tools, and advanced data pipelines. You’ll use licensed AI tools internally to enhance your daily workflows and collaborate with colleagues, and will be given regular opportunities to explore and learn new tooling to help us all stay ahead of the curve and work smarter.
High-Impact, Varied Environment
You won’t be pigeonholed into a narrow engineering role. Instead, you’ll tackle a variety of challenges, on a variety of products, from improving backend architectures and optimizing models to experimenting with new tools and frameworks. Your work will make an immediate, visible difference to clients and the company’s trajectory.
Autonomy and Ownership
Rather than waiting for permission, you’ll propose solutions, influence product direction, and shape development processes. Our flat org structure eliminates red tape and encourages direct communication. If you see an opportunity to build something better, you run with it.
Exposure to the Entire Business
At Salt Media, you won’t be isolated in your own technical corner. You’ll collaborate closely with product leaders, data scientists, client-facing teams, and even the CEO. This cross-functional exposure expands your understanding of the product and customers, helping you hone both technical and business skills.
Fast-Paced Growth and Learning
Ad tech is evolving quickly, and we move with it. That means constant learning, continuous improvement, and never feeling stuck in outdated tech stacks or stale processes. As the company grows, so do your opportunities—new responsibilities, new projects, and a larger platform to showcase your talents.
A Culture of Curiosity and Transparency
Expect open communication, direct feedback, and a culture that values curiosity and problem solving over rigid hierarchies. You’ll join a team that encourages questions, celebrates breakthroughs, and is genuinely excited about building product to shake up a traditional industry.

As a Lead Data Scientist at Tiger Analytics, you will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and drive business value through advanced analytics.

Key Responsibilities:


Accelerate and improve the entire network design process, from raw data to a model ready for running in tools like Coupa or Llamasoft
This involves: Getting data and identifying/correcting outliers in capacity, throughputs, and transportation costs
Creating models for auto-completion of missing data and new routes
Automating the creation of common scenarios, such as optimizing warehouse locations (deleting or adding warehouses) in a dynamic and globally applicable way
Connecting multiple isolated models- The core of this involves mathematical optimization models (mixed-integer linear programming)
Combine data science with supply chain knowledge to adapt to available data
Develop heuristics to accelerate NP-hard network design models that currently take days to run
The goal is to automate the running of hundreds of models in the background to provide possible improvements without manual intervention
Supply Chain Analysis:
Normalize historical data (3-5 years) to reflect the supply chain accurately, removing anomalies like strikes
Identify when and why the real supply chain deviates from the plan (root cause analysis)
Analyze bottlenecks in the supply chain
Find ""general insights"" that analysts might not know to look for, such as unexpected correlations between events across different parts of the supply chain (e.g., promotions in Luxembourg causing stockouts in Spain). This requires creative thinking beyond simple correlation due to the complexity and temporal aspects of the global supply chain
Identify trends where things are operating outside of normal parameters for any KPI or action in the supply chain

From humble bootstrapped beginnings, we are now a venture-backed growth story amassing 300,000+ users and a growing number of noteworthy enterprise partners.

We've grown exponentially with a small, but incredibly talented founding engineering team. As the team expands, we are looking for true outliers in ability, ambition and desire to build something great.

Why should you be part of Fiscal.ai (formerly FinChat) growth story?


Fiscal.ai (formerly FinChat) is on the path of becoming the de-facto company for the financial data vertical. This is a chance to be part of something huge, early. Fiscal.ai (formerly FinChat) has grown over 10X in the past 12 months and we're just getting started
Become part of the ownership Team. You're getting a piece of the pie
Startups are fast paced and dynamic. This is your chance to be a swiss-army knife
You're part of a tight-knit team where everyone is working together with no bureaucracy


Brief Description of the Role:

Fiscal.ai, a leading provider of generative AI for finance, is seeking a FullStack Engineer to join our Development team, particularly leading the QA efforts of the Terminal product of Fiscal.ai.

Help improve our current product offerings and push Fiscal.ai towards becoming a leader in the Financial Data space. Enhance our company processes, documentation and workflows to build a best in class product. You will be the leader of the newly formed QA team and have the chance to make your mark on the future of the business and our products. You will also have the opportunity to touch every part of our codebase, gaining valuable experience and skills to grow within the team and become responsible for many aspects of the product.

This role is not a simple QA testing role. We are a small team and the expectation is that every team member will wear many hats and be eager to contribute in many ways. The ideal candidate has strong full-stack engineering skills, as well as some interest/background in QA processes and tools.

Key Responsibilities:


Perform remediation/fixes on bugs/issues flagged by our test processes as well as customer issues
Take ownership of E2E testing/remediation
Maintain documentation and perform testing on multiple devices, and browsers
Plan and Execute verification of new/existing features
Take full ownership of all QA/bug artifacts
Point out execution gaps and own/lead process improvements
Actively look into customer-facing issues being reported
Identify, analyze, document and fix defects, questionable functions, errors, and inconsistencies in applications


Requirements

To be successful in this role, the ideal candidate should have:


3+ years experience in Fullstack Development
Background or interest in QA Testing
Experience in manual and automated testing
Basic knowledge of Restful API's
Knowledge of task tracking tools (Linear will be preferable)
Be able to work independently, problem solve and communicate well
Eager to work in a unique fast-growing startup
Developer-Level Remediation Skills: As part of this role, you will not only identify bugs and issues—but also be responsible for remediating them directly in code. This is a hybrid QA + Dev role, and we need someone comfortable operating in both


Nice to Haves:

While not required, it would be beneficial for the candidate to have:


Proven experience/interest in Investing/Finance! Our platform is built for Investors by Investors so everyone on our team is expected to carry some Investment knowledge/experience.
Dev ops experience related to creating/managing dev & staging environments
Ability to take ownership of adding testing into our platform (Frontend, Backend, UI, APIS)
Experience with UI Testing/Automation


Tech Stack:

We work with a wide variety of tools and technologies.

Current Stack/Tools: Typescript, React, Tailwind, Node, NextJS, Cloudflare, Firestore/Firebase, Postgress, Prisma, variety of LLM's

Location: Fully Remote

NOTE: If you are not comfortable writing bug fixes using our stack, this role is not for you. We are looking for Full Stack engineers who can confidently step into the codebase and help us move fast and ship reliably, not QA testers.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

A personality that shines, the ability to adapt to any situation and make people feel at ease. These are a few of the qualities we’re looking for in our cabin crew.

As the face of Emirates, you’ll be the person customers turn to for help and direction when they fly with us, so you need to be friendly, observant and able to provide the right support.

Being a member of the cabin crew is so much more than a service role - safety is our highest priority. You’ll need to lead confidently and take control when it comes to managing aircraft services, security, and safety procedures. This comes from the world-class learning experience our crew receive at our state-of-the-art facility in Dubai.




Qualifications & Experience




Here are some other things we look for in our cabin crew:

You’ve had more than a year’s experience in hospitality/customer service
You have a positive attitude and the natural ability to provide excellent service in a team environment, dealing with people from many cultures
Your minimum qualification is high school graduate (Grade 12)
You need to be fluent in written and spoken English (ability to speak another language is an advantage)
You’re at least 160cm tall and can reach 212 cm while standing on tiptoes, to enable you to reach emergency equipment on all aircraft types
No visible tattoos while you’re in Emirates cabin crew uniform (without covering them with bandages or cosmetics)
As Emirates cabin crew, you’ll be based in Dubai and will need to meet the UAE's employment visa requirements




Aside from the requirements of the role, you should be determined to always perform to the highest standards, focus on being solution oriented, and be able to manage a demanding work schedule. You should have the ability to deliver an authentic experience to our customers. You’ll be culturally aware and reflect the Emirates personality - professional, empathetic, progressive, visionary and cosmopolitan.

an overseas meal allowance.




Basic salary = AED 4,430 / month,

Flying Pay = AED 63.75 / hour based on avg. 80-100 hours / month,

Average Total Pay = AED 10,170 / month (~USD 2,770, EUR 2,710 or GBP 2,280).

We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together.

Your models don't just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you, read on.

AlgaeCal is on the hunt for an Intermediate Data Scientist to develop mathematical algorithms and apply machine learning to analyze business data, test hypotheses, and turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.

This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we're driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world's only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you'll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.

This job might be for you if you've got...


2+ years experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You've built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don't just analyze numbers, you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You've used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that'll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis
Kaggle-level knowledge of artificial intelligence models. And if you think RAG is something you clean your countertops with, this probably isn't the role for you.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it's regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don't just apply models, you understand how they work under the hood
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You've worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You're the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don't just crunch numbers, you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You're proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability

Strong experience with LLMs (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, open-source models) and prompt engineering
Experience building and maintaining production-grade AI systems
Proficiency in Python, JS/TS, or similar, with the ability to build and deploy full workflows
Familiarity with APIs, webhooks, vector databases, and automation platforms (Zapier, LangChain, etc.)
Ability to work independently, switch contexts, and move quickly without much oversight
Clear technical communication and systematic thinking


Preferred Qualifications


Experience in startup environments, AI tooling, or no-code/low-code stack integrations
Prior experience launching AI-powered products or tools
Familiarity with frameworks like Lang Graph, Pinecone, LlamaIndex, or RAG architectures
Strong intuition for product and user experience


💡 You're a Great Fit If You…


Ship real tools, not just demos
Can own an entire product or subsystem on your own
Love solving messy problems with clean code and smart automations
Thrive in ambiguity, move fast, and never wait to be told what to do
Are open to both career tracks: operator or co-founder
Are hungry for more than a job, you want a mission

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.




About the Role:




We're seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to bridge the gap between our data products, data science insights and production systems. You'll be responsible for taking ML models from concept to production, building robust MLOps infrastructure, and ensuring our machine learning systems operate reliably at scale. This role focuses on the engineering aspects of ML design, deployment, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure.




What you will do:




Design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion to model serving
Build automated model training, validation, and deployment workflows using CI/CD best practices
Develop and maintain MLOps infrastructure for model versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment
Create robust monitoring and alerting systems for model performance, data drift, and system health
Optimize model inference performance and cost for production workloads
Collaborate with our Data Engineers to design and implement feature stores and feature pipelines
Develop automated data quality checks and validation frameworks for ML pipelines
Build scalable feature engineering workflows that support both batch and real-time inference
Implement data versioning and lineage tracking for reproducible ML workflows
Partner with Software Data Scientists to productionize research models and experiments
Implement frameworks for model evaluation and gradual rollouts
Design automated retraining pipelines and model refresh strategies
Establish best practices for model governance, documentation, and compliance
Work closely with Software Engineers to integrate ML capabilities into existing applications
Contribute to architectural decisions for scalable, maintainable ML systems
Participate in code reviews, documentation, and knowledge sharing across teams
Mentor junior engineers on ML engineering best practices




The right person for this role will have:




3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, MLOps, or related fields
Strong proficiency in Python for ML development and automation
Solid SQL skills for data manipulation and analysis
Hands-on experience with AWS or other cloud platforms (Azure, or GCP) and their ML services
Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for ML workloads
Proficiency with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and MLOps tools
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code principles
Databricks experience is a plus
Experience with feature engineering at scale and feature store implementations
Understanding of model monitoring, observability, and production ML challenges
Knowledge of data quality frameworks and automated testing for ML systems
Familiarity with distributed computing frameworks (Databricks or Sagemaker) for large-scale ML
Experience with experiment tracking and model versioning tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases, etc.)




Bonus points if you have:




Master's or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or related quantitative field Experience with real-time ML inference and streaming data pipelines
Knowledge of AutoML platforms and automated hyperparameter tuning
Familiarity with model compression, quantization, and edge deployment Experience with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud ML architectures
Contributions to open-source ML tools or platforms




Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
4 weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 days of the year




Application process:

Please submit your resume highlighting relevant experience and include a cover letter explaining your interest in the specific role
Provide links to relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or publications

          <p><strong>We’re Quandri, our mission is to unlock the world’s insurance data so brokerages and agencies can best serve their clients. Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business. </strong></p><p><br></p><p>We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of <u>LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups</u> in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.</p><p><br></p><p>Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&amp;O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts.

Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.




Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. For over five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck, Rakovina Therapeutics, and ImmVue Therapeutics.




You will help identify, clean, prepare, and test datasets; run experiments to evaluate new architectures and tune hyperparameters; continually improve the robustness and efficiency of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. In this process, you will have the opportunity to build your skills by collaborating with our team of accomplished ML scientists and chemists. Software engineering expertise is required, as well as experience with deep learning and generative models; knowledge of chemistry and pharmacology is preferred be not required.




Here is the background we’re looking for:

M.S. (Ph.D. preferred) in CS, applied mathematics, statistics, physics, or related discipline;
Experience with machine learning techniques, including diffusion models, Transformers, and Bayesian optimization, preferably demonstrated through peer-reviewed publications;
Two or more years’ experience developing robust code on larger projects, including code review, refactoring, unit testing, version control, etc.;
Mastery of Python and PyTorch;
Strong background in chemistry or pharmacology; and
Intellectual curiosity and drive to excel.




We are an equal opportunity employer and enthusiastically welcome applications from women, BIPOC, and members of underrepresented communities and groups. Compensation is a competitive mix of cash and options. We prioritize expertise and passion over where you decide to live and work. Please send resumes/CVs to info@variational.ai.

Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.</p><p><br></p><p>Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. For over five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck, Rakovina Therapeutics, and ImmVue Therapeutics.</p><p><br></p><p>You will help identify, clean, prepare, and test datasets; run experiments to evaluate new architectures and tune hyperparameters; continually improve the robustness and efficiency of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. In this process, you will have the opportunity to build your skills by collaborating with our team of accomplished ML scientists and chemists. Software engineering expertise is required, as well as experience with deep learning and generative models; knowledge of chemistry and pharmacology is preferred be not required.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here is the background we’re looking for:</strong></p><ul><li>M.S.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Location: Kelowna, BC (In-studio)

Benefits: Health, Dental, and Vision

👋 About Us

Martell Ventures is not your typical venture studio. We’re an AI-native incubator backed by world-class operators, built to launch scalable companies that solve real problems for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) around the world.

Our mission is clear: empower high-agency founders to build enduring, profitable companies that create massive impact through automation, intelligence, and personalization.

Our Principles


Big Problems Only — We solve urgent, budgeted problems in large underserved markets.
Don’t Repeat Yourself — We systematize everything to scale with leverage.
Build Empires — We back founders building generational companies, not feature factories.
Default to Action — Speed and execution beat planning and perfection.
Always Day 0 — We stay hungry, humble, and never coast on past wins.


How We Operate

As a CEO or CTO inside Martell Ventures, you’ll operate like a founder owning vision, execution, and upside, while plugging into a studio with unfair advantages:

We partner with proven entrepreneurs and elite technical builders to form two-person founding teams. Together, we incubate high-leverage AI startups inside our 90-day sprint model. Every venture launches with capital, distribution, execution playbooks, and hands-on support from 8-figure founders and GTM operators.

We don’t bet on ideas, we bet on operators.


Distribution via Dan Martell’s network and SMB audience
Execution playbooks used by 8-figure companies
Elite founder community with weekly accountability rhythms
Access to capital, talent, and market insight from day one


We’re not building shiny MVPs or B2C toys. We’re building enduring companies—designed from day one to hit $500K in 90 days and $10M ARR in 36 months.

15-minute intro call
Strengths assessment – how you learn and do
In-person interview – values and culture fit

🚀 About NEO

NEO is building the AI-native content generation engine for the next era of creators. By turning long-form video into high-performing social content with zero friction, NEO enables creators and marketing teams to scale their brand across platforms effortlessly. With platform-specific script generation, LLM flexibility, and media-rich content repurposing, we make going viral repeatable.

Currently, pre-revenue with validated technical infrastructure, NEO is seeking a high-output founding CEO to lead customer acquisition, validate the monetizable pain, and build traction fast.

💼 About the Role

As the CEO / Business Lead at NEO, you’ll be the commercial co-founder responsible for turning product capability into paid growth, fast.

You'll work side-by-side with NEO’s founding technical lead (the creator of the core AI engine) to validate demand, close high-value deals, and drive traction in a space that’s ripe for disruption. Your focus? Revenue, retention, and relentless execution. No fundraising required, this is about generating cash, not pitch decks.

Lead customer discovery to uncover urgent, high-spend video workflow pain points
Drive outbound strategy, run demos, and convert early pilots into paying clients Craft high-converting messaging for creators, agencies, and growth teams

Turn sharp feedback into tighter offers, faster iterations, and stronger retention


Strategy & Execution


Build GTM experiments and landing pages that convert
Track core metrics daily: retention, CAC, churn, LTV, revenue
Work closely with the technical founder to prioritize roadmap decisions based on revenue opportunity
Lead with urgency, iterate quickly, and drive relentless commercial progress


Brand & Partnerships


Serve as the external face of NEO: early narrative, demo calls, and strategic deals
Create and maintain key relationships with early adopters, partners, and advisors
Elevate the NEO brand with positioning that resonates in the creator economy and B2B video space


🧠 What You Bring

Proven success in outbound sales, cold outreach, and deal conversion
Strong copywriting and positioning skills, your words move people
Comfortable operating with speed, ambiguity, and direct responsibility for revenue
Data-fluent: you use dashboards, KPIs, and retention metrics to guide decisions

Preferred Qualifications


Prior startup, founder, or early GTM leadership experience
Experience working with creators, video teams, or performance marketers
Familiarity with modern sales tools, landing page builders, and CRM platforms

💡 You're a Great Fit If You…


Are obsessed with traction, outcomes, and learning what makes customers buy
Want to build something fast, with clear product-market signal
Thrive in zero-to-one chaos and are allergic to corporate pace
Know how to write, pitch, sell, and close
Want co-founder-level ownership without fundraising headaches
Are hungry for more than a job, you want a mission
