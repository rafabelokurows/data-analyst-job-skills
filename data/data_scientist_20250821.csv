Driving lasting impact and building long-term capabilities with our clients is not easy work. You are the kind of person who thrives in a high performance/high reward culture - doing hard things, picking yourself up when you stumble, and having the resilience to try another way forward.

In return for your drive, determination, and curiosity, we'll provide the resources, mentorship, and opportunities you need to become a stronger leader faster than you ever thought possible. Your colleagues—at all levels—will invest deeply in your development, just as much as they invest in delivering exceptional results for clients. Every day, you'll receive apprenticeship, coaching, and exposure that will accelerate your growth in ways you won’t find anywhere else.

When you join us, you will have:


Continuous learning: Our learning and apprenticeship culture, backed by structured programs, is all about helping you grow while creating an environment where feedback is clear, actionable, and focused on your development. The real magic happens when you take the input from others to heart and embrace the fast-paced learning experience, owning your journey.
A voice that matters: From day one, we value your ideas and contributions. You’ll make a tangible impact by offering innovative ideas and practical solutions. We not only encourage diverse perspectives, but they are critical in driving us toward the best possible outcomes.
Global community: With colleagues across 65+ countries and over 100 different nationalities, our firm’s diversity fuels creativity and helps us come up with the best solutions for our clients. Plus, you’ll have the opportunity to learn from exceptional colleagues with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
World-class benefits: On top of a competitive salary (based on your location, experience, and skills), we provide a comprehensive benefits package to enable holistic well-being for you and your family.


Your Impact

You will leverage industry knowledge and analytical expertise to provide insights both to clients as part of client service teams and within the agricultural analytics team (ACRE) by strengthening the core products and algorithms we build for clients. You can expect to split your time delivering impact at clients (including up to ~50% travel to client sites) and building up ACRE’s core analytical offerings.

As a member of client service teams, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to tackle clients’ most pressing issues using an analytical lens, meeting client needs and communicating your work to executive audiences. Issues to solve could include determining the suitability (now and in the future given impacts of climate change) of growing different types of crops across different geographies, using local agronomic data and satellite imagery to determine market potential for input products, or optimizing farm operations using yield forecasting. Your work will often include heavy geospatial components and/or predictive analytics components.

When working internally with the ACRE team, you will build innovative algorithms and products (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will use global data such as geospatial, biological, economic and climatological data to develop proprietary solutions. You will work with our engineers to design new interfaces to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.

Along the way, you will receive best-in-class training in structuring business problems and serving as a client adviser and have opportunities to work closely with and learn from our senior agriculture practitioners and industry players that are shaping the future of food production. You will get access to unparalleled career acceleration, with a huge amount of ownership and responsibility from the get-go in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will get the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world. Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest agribusiness players around the globe.

We encourage you to submit a cover letter to highlight why you believe that you are a unique fit for our team and what we do! We will read it.

Our Agriculture Practice advises agribusiness, consumer food, government, and investor clients on strategic, marketing & sales, and operations issues, helping support industry-shaping decisions that impact the future of global food production.

Within this group, ACRE is a team of expert consultants, data scientists, and engineers focused on bringing cutting-edge analytics to our agribusiness clients. We apply real-time data and advanced analytics – generally predictive or geospatial in nature – to solve the biggest problems currently facing global agricultural markets, driving insights at the micro and macro levels.

ACRE is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients. You’ll work with McKinsey’s agricultural analytics team (ACRE) in Brussels. 02

Most Python roles are about building applications. This one is about building trading systems that make split-second decisions in global markets.




You’ll be helping to power the next generation of trading infrastructure, designing and building scalable, high-performance microservices all within a fast-paced environment. The other aspects will be to work closely with the wider team, collaborating with traders and other engineers to turn ideas into reality.




There are lots of projects going on but your initial focus will be helping to expand the exchange connectivity by adding new markets, building Python-based microservices for trading operations and developing features for funding rate prediction.




You’re going to ideally be coming from a HFT background, with a minimum of 5 years of experience developing Python based microservices. The team is small and spread across Europe so you will need to be independent and be able to push projects through autonomously. Where a lot of HFT environments require you to be on-site almost every day, this one gives you flexibility of where you're based.




This a global high-frequency trading firm, specialising in crypto markets and leveraging cutting-edge technology to shape the future of trading on real-time. Starting salary is around $150k plus bonuses.




If you want your work to shape real-world trading decisions in a fast-paced, collaborative environment, get in touch.

Delen Private Bank is een private vermogensbeheerder met een sterk uitgebouwd IT-team van 160 collega’s, binnen een organisatie van 600 medewerkers. We ontzorgen onze klanten met discretionair vermogensbeheer en -planning en zetten volop in op automatisatie via onze strategisch intern ontwikkelde Core Banking software.




Het AI team

Het AI Team binnen het data-domein van de IT-organisatie fungeert als brug tussen innovatieve AI-concepten en hun duurzame integratie in de operationele processen van de organisatie. Dit gebeurt vanuit onze visie om een vertrouwd, enterprise-grade AI platform op te zetten dat verantwoordelijke innovatie bij Delen stimuleert. Als centraal expertisecentrum werkt het team domeinoverschrijdend om proofs of concept uit het AI lab om te zetten in robuuste, schaalbare en verantwoorde AI-oplossingen in productie. Met een sterke focus op ethiek, verklaarbaarheid en technische integriteit, fungeert het team als center of excellence dat andere teams in staat stelt om AI-oplossingen op een verantwoorde manier en op schaal te leveren.

Het team bestaat momenteel uit een AI Product Owner, die de integratie aanstuurt van een herbruikbare suite van AI-capaciteiten in het IT-landschap, en is nu op zoek naar de eerste engineering-aanwinst om de technische fundamenten voor AI-adoptie in de organisatie uit te bouwen.




MLOps Engineer – Fundamentele Rol binnen het AI Team

Als onderdeel van het AI Team speelt de MLOps Engineer een fundamentele rol in het bouwen van de technische ruggengraat en operationele processen voor grootschalige AI-adoptie. Dit omvat het definiëren en implementeren van de MLOps architectuur die nodig is om machine learning-projecten in productie te brengen binnen de organisatie.

Deze rol is ideaal voor een ervaren platform- of MLOps engineer die eerder heeft bijgedragen aan het in productie brengen van ML-capaciteiten, bijvoorbeeld door interne ML-platformen te bouwen, modellen veilig en op schaal uit te rollen, of betrouwbare patronen te definiëren voor AI in productie.

De focus ligt op het versnellen van AI-innovatie binnen operationele processen, met behoud van kwaliteit, betrouwbaarheid en ethische integriteit van ML-oplossingen.

Opererend binnen het Data Domain, werkt de MLOps Engineer nauw samen met het DAR team, maar met een bredere scope: ondersteuning van meerdere domeinen, beheer van AI-oplossingen in productie, en begeleiding bij implementaties in samenwerking met andere teams.




Jouw verantwoordelijkheden

Definieer en implementeer het fundamentele MLOps framework voor modelontwikkeling, implementatie en monitoring binnen het IT-landschap.
Bouw en onderhoud de kerninfrastructuur en gedeelde capaciteiten die veilige en schaalbare AI-adoptie binnen de organisatie ondersteunen.
Bied duidelijke architecturale en operationele richtlijnen om andere teams in staat te stellen AI-oplossingen op een verantwoorde manier te bouwen en te beheren.
Evalueer en integreer MLOps tooling, met focus op Azure-native en Databricks-compatible oplossingen.
Stel standaarden, patronen en documentatie op om consistentie, betrouwbaarheid en onderhoudbaarheid in ML-ontwikkeling te garanderen.
Werk nauw samen met data engineers, architects en infrastructure teams om een vlotte integratie van AI-capaciteiten in productieomgevingen te verzekeren.
Bevorder observability, CI/CD discipline en lifecycle management in de context van AI-workloads.
Draag bij aan verantwoorde AI-adoptie door compliance, transparantie en beveiliging te verankeren in gedeelde tools en processen.
Zet mechanismen op om model performance en drift te monitoren, om zo de langdurige kwaliteit en het vertrouwen in productie-AI-systemen te waarborgen.




Wat jij meebrengt

Must-have

Ervaring met de volledige machine learning development lifecycle, en met het toepassen van DevOps principles (zoals CI/CD, testen, monitoring) op ML- of data-gedreven systemen.
Vaardig in Microsoft Azure en Databricks omgevingen, inclusief ervaring met het uitrollen en beheren van productie-workloads in de cloud.
Sterk begrip van containerization (Docker) en orchestration (Kubernetes) in een enterprise-context.
Aangetoonde ervaring in het bouwen en onderhouden van gedeelde infrastructuur of platformen die door andere teams worden gebruikt.
Werkkennis van Generative AI technologieën, waaronder prompt engineering, fine-tuning strategies, embeddings, en Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
Vertrouwd met vector databases en hun integratie in productie-AI-systemen.




Mindset

Sterke samenwerkingsvaardigheden en het vermogen om anderen te begeleiden en ondersteunen bij het adopteren van gedeelde frameworks en standaarden.
Een pragmatische, platform-first benadering gericht op langdurige onderhoudbaarheid, veiligheid en compliance.
Een sterk gevoel van ownership en verantwoordelijkheid in het bouwen van betrouwbare en herbruikbare capaciteiten.

Vastberaden om zich op de toekomst te richten, streeft zij er niet alleen naar een slimme en duurzame stad te worden, maar ook een proactieve rol op te nemen tegenover de grote uitdagingen van onze tijd.

In dit kader speelt de Directie Strategie en Digitale Transformatie een centrale rol. Zij stuurt de uitwerking en de opvolging van de algemene strategie van de Stad, coördineert de structurele projecten en leidt de programma’s voor digitale transformatie met het oog op de opbouw van een slimme stad die steunt op datagebruik.

Om deze ambitie te versterken, heeft de Stad beslist haar Dienst Strategie uit te rusten met een innovatieteam. Gedurende de komende drie jaar zal dit team de opdracht hebben zich te richten op twee complexe, transversale en prioritaire uitdagingen voor Brussel. Het zal worden aangemoedigd om nieuwe werkmethodes en benaderingen van publieke innovatie uit te testen.

Dit initiatief beoogt een dubbele doelstelling: de levenskwaliteit van de Brusselaars concreet verbeteren én innovatieve praktijken, eenmaal bewezen, duurzaam te verankeren binnen de administratie, om zo haar modernisering en aanpassingsvermogen te ondersteunen.

This position is part of City of Brussels participation in the Bloomberg Philanthropies Innovation team (i-team) program. Charged with helping city officials and civic partners design and implement solutions that meet pressing local challenges, the i-team will expertly deploy data, collect insight, and collaborate across sectors—crowding the energy and resources across City of Brussels—to develop resident-centered interventions that improve people’s lives. The i-team will receive technical assistance from regional and global specialists, and benefit from learnings from peers in city halls across the region and around the world. To date, the Bloomberg Philanthropies i-team initiative has reached over 100 cities across 16 countries and four continents—representing more than 100 million residents—and inspired hundreds of other local governments to embrace innovation systems and practices.

In return for your drive, determination, and curiosity, we'll provide the resources, mentorship, and opportunities you need to become a stronger leader faster than you ever thought possible. Your colleagues—at all levels—will invest deeply in your development, just as much as they invest in delivering exceptional results for clients. Every day, you'll receive apprenticeship, coaching, and exposure that will accelerate your growth in ways you won’t find anywhere else.

When you join us, you will have:


Continuous learning: Our learning and apprenticeship culture, backed by structured programs, is all about helping you grow while creating an environment where feedback is clear, actionable, and focused on your development. The real magic happens when you take the input from others to heart and embrace the fast-paced learning experience, owning your journey.
A voice that matters: From day one, we value your ideas and contributions. You’ll make a tangible impact by offering innovative ideas and practical solutions. We not only encourage diverse perspectives, but they are critical in driving us toward the best possible outcomes.
Global community: With colleagues across 65+ countries and over 100 different nationalities, our firm’s diversity fuels creativity and helps us come up with the best solutions for our clients. Plus, you’ll have the opportunity to learn from exceptional colleagues with diverse backgrounds and experiences.

Your Impact

You will leverage industry knowledge and analytical expertise to provide insights both to clients as part of client service teams and within the agricultural analytics team (ACRE) by strengthening the core products and algorithms we build for clients. You can expect to split your time delivering impact at clients (including up to ~50% travel to client sites) and building up ACRE’s core analytical offerings.

As a member of client service teams, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to tackle clients’ most pressing issues using an analytical lens, meeting client needs and communicating your work to executive audiences. Issues to solve could include determining the suitability (now and in the future given impacts of climate change) of growing different types of crops across different geographies, using local agronomic data and satellite imagery to determine market potential for input products, or optimizing farm operations using yield forecasting. Your work will often include heavy geospatial components and/or predictive analytics components.

When working internally with the ACRE team, you will build innovative algorithms and products (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will use global data such as geospatial, biological, economic and climatological data to develop proprietary solutions. You will work with our engineers to design new interfaces to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.

Along the way, you will receive best-in-class training in structuring business problems and serving as a client adviser and have opportunities to work closely with and learn from our senior agriculture practitioners and industry players that are shaping the future of food production. You will get access to unparalleled career acceleration, with a huge amount of ownership and responsibility from the get-go in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will get the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world. Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest agribusiness players around the globe.

We encourage you to submit a cover letter to highlight why you believe that you are a unique fit for our team and what we do! We will read it.

Our Agriculture Practice advises agribusiness, consumer food, government, and investor clients on strategic, marketing & sales, and operations issues, helping support industry-shaping decisions that impact the future of global food production.

Within this group, ACRE is a team of expert consultants, data scientists, and engineers focused on bringing cutting-edge analytics to our agribusiness clients. We apply real-time data and advanced analytics – generally predictive or geospatial in nature – to solve the biggest problems currently facing global agricultural markets, driving insights at the micro and macro levels.

ACRE is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients. You’ll work with McKinsey’s agricultural analytics team (ACRE) in Brussels. 02

The NATO Office of Resources (NOR) provides independent and integrated expert advice to the Secretary General, NATO Resource Committees, Allies, and other stakeholders on the planning, allocation and utilisation of military common funding made available to achieve NATO’s goals and objectives.

The NOR advice is based on sound judgement underpinned by facts, figures expertise and knowledge. It follows NATO policies, procedures and standards, and is independent of external stakeholder’s viewpoints. It supports efficient and effective use of public funds by assessing the policy compliance, eligibility, affordability, technical viability, and lifecycle implications of military requirements and proposed solutions. Furthermore, the NOR facilitates resource-informed political decision-making.

The NOR Air and Space Capabilities (ASC) Branch provides technical, financial, economic and political advice and support regarding implementation of NATO common-funded capabilities, in particular capital investments under the NATO Security Investment Programme (NSIP) and Operations & Maintenance (O&M) funded by the NATO Military Budget. The Branch ensures the delivery of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), NATO-wide Air Command & Control (AirC2), Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) including Indications & Warning (I&W), Surveillance and Control (including NATO Airborne Early Warning & Control and Alliance Future Surveillance and Control), as well as Space capabilities.

The incumbent is a member of the ASC Branch and responsible for the development of expert advice on future Surveillance and Control systems. Within an area of responsibility, they advise the resource committees, Strategic Commanders, NATO Agencies and NATO nations by:


evaluating military requirements and associated technical solutions presented in Capability Programme Plans and Project Proposals from an investment, running cost and workforce point of view;
evaluating and reporting on requests for authorisation to implement projects and budgets required for the operation and maintenance of the implemented systems;

In cancer care, treatment decisions can take many days—but patients don’t have that time. One of the reasons for delays? Cancer patients' data is scattered across many places: doctor’s notes, medical imagery, genomics data. At kaiko, we are developing AI foundation models to bring this data together and integrate it into clinical workflows, enabling doctors to make faster, more effective treatments decisions.

We also collaborate closely with the leading Dutch cancer research institute (NKI) on multiple AI research projects and a joint clinical validation initiative. In 2025, we plan on expanding our partnerships to even more hospitals.

We raised significant long-term funding and have offices in Zurich and Amsterdam. Over the past year, our team has nearly doubled in size, now comprising 80+ people from 25 countries and we just got recognized as a Rising Innovator at the GenAI conference  

About The Role

You'll be responsible for building and scaling the infrastructure that powers our AI foundation models, directly impacting our ability to help doctors make faster, more effective treatment decisions. Your work will be crucial as we expand our partnerships and scale our operations. You will work closely with our Machine Learning and Data teams to create a robust and efficient platform.

You will be based in either The Netherlands or Switzerland, with the expectation of spending at least 50% of your time at the office.

Some areas of responsibility


You’ll write, maintain, and enhance Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate the provisioning and management of our infrastructure.
You’ll design and optimize CI/CD pipelines for efficient testing, building, and deployment, ensuring our systems are highly available and reliable.
You’ll scale and optimize our containerized applications using Kubernetes.
You’ll design and implement hybrid strategies to support workloads across both on-premises and cloud environments.


If you are a hands-on engineer who thrives on building scalable, automated systems and are excited about enabling cutting-edge AI research to achieve our goal of revolutionizing cancer care, we think you will love this job.

About You


You have significant experience with containerization and deployment technologies like Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, and Docker.
You possess strong knowledge of software engineering best practices and CI/CD tooling such as ArgoCD and GitHub Actions.
You have strong software engineering skills in languages like Python, Go, C++, Rust or similar languages.
You bring hands-on experience with modern observability stacks (Grafana, Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, Loki, fluent-bit).


Nice to have:


Experience with machine learning infrastructure or HPC clusters (Linux, NVIDIA GPUs, SLURM, Infiniband).
Familiarity with AI/ML frameworks like Ray or MLFlow.
Experience with data pipeline/ETL tools (Dagster, dbt)
Experience with hybrid or on-prem systems.


We are excited to gather a broad range of perspectives in our team, as we believe it will help us build better products to support a broader set of people. If you’re excited about us but don’t fit every single qualification, we still encourage you to apply: we’ve had incredible team members join us who didn’t check every box!

Why kaiko

At kaiko, we believe the best ideas come from collaboration, ownership and ambition. We’ve built a team of international experts where your work has direct impact. Here’s what we value:


Ownership: You’ll have the autonomy to set your own goals, make critical decisions, and see the direct impact of your work.
Collaboration: You’ll have to approach disagreement with curiosity, build on common ground and create solutions together.
Ambition: You’ll be surrounded by people who set high standards for themselves and others, who see obstacles as opportunities, and who are relentless in their work to create better outcomes for patients.

An attractive and competitive salary, a good pension plan and 25 vacation days per year.
Great offsites and team events to strengthen the team and celebrate successes together.
A EUR 1000 learning and development budget to help you grow.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Team

We are seeking passionate Research Scientists and Engineers to join our growing Pre-training team in Zurich. We are involved in developing the next generation of large language models. The team primarily focuses on multimodal capabilities: giving LLMs the ability to understand and interact with modalities other than text.

In this role, you will work at the intersection of cutting-edge research and practical engineering, contributing to the development of safe, steerable, and trustworthy AI systems.

Responsibilities

In this role you will interact with many parts of the engineering and research stacks.


Conduct research and implement solutions in areas such as model architecture, algorithms, data processing, and optimizer development
Independently lead small research projects while collaborating with team members on larger initiatives
Design, run, and analyze scientific experiments to advance our understanding of large language models
Optimize and scale our training infrastructure to improve efficiency and reliability
Develop and improve dev tooling to enhance team productivity
Contribute to the entire stack, from low-level optimizations to high-level model design


Qualifications & Experience

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single criterion. Because we focus on so many areas, the team is looking for both experienced engineers and strong researchers, and encourage anyone along the researcher/engineer spectrum to apply.


Degree (BA required, MS or PhD preferred) in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related field
Strong software engineering skills with a proven track record of building complex systems
Expertise in Python and deep learning frameworks
Have worked on high-performance, large-scale ML systems, particularly in the context of language modeling
Familiarity with ML Accelerators, Kubernetes, and large-scale data processing
Strong problem-solving skills and a results-oriented mindset
Excellent communication skills and ability to work in a collaborative environment


You'll thrive in this role if you


Have significant software engineering experience
Are able to balance research goals with practical engineering constraints
Are happy to take on tasks outside your job description to support the team
Enjoy pair programming and collaborative work
Are eager to learn more about machine learning research
Are enthusiastic to work at an organization that functions as a single, cohesive team pursuing large-scale AI research projects
Have ambitious goals for AI safety and general progress in the next few years, and you’re excited to create the best outcomes over the long-term


Sample Projects


Optimizing the throughput of novel attention mechanisms
Proposing Transformer variants, and experimentally comparing their performance
Preparing large-scale datasets for model consumption
Scaling distributed training jobs to thousands of accelerators
Designing fault tolerance strategies for training infrastructure
Creating interactive visualizations of model internals, such as attention patterns


If you're excited about pushing the boundaries of AI while prioritizing safety and ethics, we want to hear from you!

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

About The Job

As an organization, Google maintains a portfolio of research projects driven by fundamental research, new product innovation, product contribution and infrastructure goals, while providing individuals and teams the freedom to emphasize specific types of work. As a Research Scientist, you'll setup large-scale tests and deploy promising ideas quickly and broadly, managing deadlines and deliverables while applying the latest theories to develop new and improved products, processes, or technologies. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, our research scientists work on real-world problems that span the breadth of computer science, such as machine (and deep) learning, data mining, natural language processing, hardware and software performance analysis, improving compilers for mobile platforms, as well as core search and much more.

As a Research Scientist, you'll also actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing your findings, with ideas inspired by internal projects as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world.

The team you'll be joining conducts basic research into alternative computational AI paradigms beyond those currently trending. We aim to deepen our understanding of how complexity emerges in differentiable/non-differentiable automated algorithm discovery methods. These methods automatically produce computer code that solves given tasks, which are often represented as a collection of data examples. We are particularly interested in finding solutions that exhibit compositionality, hierarchical structures, and component reuse. In this role, you’ll research, develop, and publish findings on novel code representations for discovering such algorithms.

Responsibilities


Carry out sustained exploratory research.
Review literature, identify key questions, design experiments, and interpret results.
Collaborate in person and remotely maintain a respectful work environment.
Share ideas verbally and in writing publish and present work at journals or scientific conferences.

CloudWalk is a fintech company reimagining the future of financial services. We are building intelligent infrastructure powered by AI, blockchain, and thoughtful design. Our products serve millions of entrepreneurs across Brazil and the US every day, helping them grow with tools that are fast, fair, and built for how business actually works. Learn more at cloudwalk.io .

Who We’re Looking For:

We’re hiring a Data Scientist to help us drive decision-making and product innovation through careful experimentation, critical thinking, and applied machine learning.

You’ll work closely with engineers, researchers, and product teams to generate insights from data, design and run A/B tests, and train models that improve our products. This is a hands-on, full-stack data science role - from SQL and EDA to modeling and business impact analysis.

We’re looking for someone who knows how to think clearly with data, ask the right questions, and translate results into action. You don’t chase trends - you like when the data makes sense.

What You'll Do:


Explore product and system data to uncover opportunities, issues, or hypotheses.
Design and analyze A/B tests, working closely with product and growth teams.
Train, tune, and evaluate classical ML models (classification, regression, ranking).
Communicate findings clearly through writing, dashboards, and presentations.
Work with backend and infra teams to deploy and monitor your models.
Build reproducible workflows using tools like notebooks, scripts, and experiment tracking.
Contribute to a culture of curiosity, rigor, and patience in how we work with data.


What We’re Looking For:


Strong analytical skills: You know how to break down a question, test a hypothesis, and avoid false conclusions
Solid ML foundation: You’re comfortable training models, tuning them, validating results, and explaining decisions
Deep EDA and data handling: You can explore a dataset from all angles, understand distributions, spot leaks, and clean things up
Experimentation mindset: You’ve designed or analyzed controlled experiments and know when an A/B test makes sense — and when it doesn’t
Code quality: You write clean Python, use version control, and prefer reproducible work
Business awareness: You think about cost, value, trade-offs, and know when a heuristic beats a model
Communication skills: You can explain your thinking in writing and discussions, with clarity and precision.


Bonus Points:


Experience with causal inference or uplift modeling
Experience in product analytics or growth-focused DS
Experience working with Airflow, BigQuery, dbt, or similar data infra
Experience in training and shipping models to production
Familiarity with basic experimentation pitfalls (SRM, novelty effects, power issues).


How We Hire:


Online assessment: technical logic and fundamentals (Math/Calculus, Statistics, Probability, Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Code)
Technical interview: deep dive into theory and reasoning for fraud detection (no code)
Cultural interview
If you are not willing to take an online quiz, do not apply.

Uma história de mais de 60 anos de solidez e inovação.

Em 1961 foi fundado o Banco Sofisa, em uma jornada de transformação, adaptação e principalmente inovação.

Hoje, temos orgulho em ser um dos principais bancos do Brasil. O motivo disso é incentivar e acreditar no empreendedor brasileiro, fortalecendo relacionamentos apoiados na ética e no respeito. Um dos fatores que nos destacam no mercado é o comprometimento dos nossos colaboradores, com forte espírito empreendedor e uma paixão que os fazem vestir a camisa como se fossem donos. É essa mesma motivação que nos leva a prêmios e conquistas notáveis, como o de Melhor Banco do Brasil, em um ranking realizado pela Forbes, no ano de 2023.

Por aqui, não nos contentamos com o status quo. Acreditamos que sempre podemos melhorar, aprender, investir e buscar o novo. A melhora contínua é um processo diário. Em 2011, inauguramos uma nova categoria de serviços bancários no Brasil, lançando o primeiro banco digital de investimentos: o Sofisa Direto. Com isso, encontramos a oportunidade ideal para manter os nossos clientes motivados a buscar os seus objetivos. Em toda a história, os negócios do Banco Sofisa foram construídos por uma sólida estrutura financeira, assegurada por altos índices de capitalização, fazendo com que os nossos clientes sintam-se seguros, investindo em ativos de qualidade, que muitas das vezes só se encontram por aqui.

Hoje, podemos dizer que vencemos o maior de todos os testes, o teste do tempo. E se esse teste foi vencido, é porque valorizamos quem realmente importa: você, nosso cliente. Cada obstáculo superado, cada desafio vencido são os fundamentos da solidez e a experiência que precisamos para seguir em frente.

Somos o Banco Sofisa. Somos diferentes!

CloudWalk is a fintech company reimagining the future of financial services. We are building intelligent infrastructure powered by AI, blockchain, and thoughtful design. Our products serve millions of entrepreneurs across Brazil and the US every day, helping them grow with tools that are fast, fair, and built for how business actually works. Learn more at cloudwalk.io .

Who We’re Looking For:

We’re hiring a Data Scientist focused on Large Language Models to join our AI R&D team. You’ll work on designing, training, and optimizing LLMs that power real product features and internal tools. You’ll touch everything from architecture and data preparation to multi-scale training and evaluation.

This is not a prompt engineering or RAG-focused role. We’re looking for someone who gets the math, understands the models, and knows how to write code that scales.

You’ll work side-by-side with engineers, MLOps, and product teams to make our LLMs smarter, faster, and more useful.

What You'll Do:


Train and fine-tune LLMs using multi-GPU and distributed setups.
Analyze model performance, debug failures, and implement improvements.
Work with curated and synthetic datasets, including classification and generation tasks.
Design experiments, track results, and iterate quickly with tools like MLflow.
Write clean, production-ready code and collaborate via GitHub.
Push boundaries: think about architecture, memory efficiency, scale, and cost.


What We’re Looking For:


LLM understanding: You know how these models work under the hood - transformer internals, tokenization, embeddings, etc.
Stats and ML fundamentals: You have a solid foundation in statistics, machine learning, and optimization.
Coding skills: You write Python well. You’ve worked with PyTorch or JAX. You don’t fear Bash or git.
Training experience: You’ve trained models beyond notebooks. Bonus if you’ve worked with mixed precision, DeepSpeed, or multi-node training.
Systems mindset: You understand trade-offs - throughput vs memory, latency vs accuracy.
Good judgment: You know when to read a paper, when to read a stack trace, and when to rewrite the dataloader or part of the LLM architecture.


Bonus Points:


Experience with Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, Accelerate.
Familiarity with Kubernetes, Ray, or custom training infra.
Exposure to embeddings, classification tasks, or token-level losses.
Ability to mentor or guide junior researchers or engineers.


How We Hire:


Online assessment: Online assessment: technical logic and fundamentals (Math/Calculus, Statistics, Probability, Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Code).
Technical interview: dive into theory and reasoning (no code).
Cultural interview.

You’ve worked with PyTorch or JAX. You don’t fear Bash or git.</li><li>Training experience: You’ve trained models beyond notebooks. Bonus if you’ve worked with mixed precision, DeepSpeed, or multi-node training.</li><li>Systems mindset: You understand trade-offs - throughput vs memory, latency vs accuracy.</li><li>Good judgment: You know when to read a paper, when to read a stack trace, and when to rewrite the dataloader or part of the LLM architecture.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Bonus Points:<br><br></strong><ul><li>Experience with Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, Accelerate.</li><li>Familiarity with Kubernetes, Ray, or custom training infra.</li><li>Exposure to embeddings, classification tasks, or token-level losses.</li><li>Ability to mentor or guide junior researchers or engineers.<br><br></li></ul><strong>How We Hire:<br><br></strong><ul><li>Online assessment: Online assessment: technical logic and fundamentals (Math/Calculus, Statistics, Probability, Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Code).</li><li>Technical interview: dive into theory and reasoning (no code).</li><li>Cultural interview.<br><br></li></ul>If you are not willing to take an online quiz, do not apply.<br><br><strong>Diversity and inclusion:<br><br></strong>We believe in social inclusion, respect, and appreciation of all people.

Fundada em 1986 por médicos professores integrantes do Departamento de Diagnóstico por Imagem da Escola Paulista de Medicina – atual Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP) –, a FIDI é uma Fundação privada sem fins lucrativos que reinveste 100% de seus recursos em assistência médica à população brasileira, por meio do desenvolvimento de soluções de diagnóstico por imagem, realização de atividades de ensino, pesquisa e extensão médico-científica, ações sociais e filantrópicas. Com 2.100 colaboradores e um corpo técnico formado por mais de 500 médicos, a FIDI está presente em 86 unidades de saúde nos estados de São Paulo e Goiás, e é a maior prestadora de serviços de diagnóstico por imagem do SUS, realizando aproximadamente 5 milhões de exames por ano, entre ressonância magnética, tomografia computadorizada, ultrassonografia, mamografia, raios-X e densitometria óssea.

A Fundação também trabalha na proposição de soluções inovadoras para a saúde pública, como o sistema de análise de imagens de tomografia computadorizada por inteligência artificial, e participou da primeira Parceria Público-Privada de diagnóstico por imagem na Bahia. Por duas vezes, a FIDI recebeu o prêmio Referências da Saúde 2019 e 2020, na categoria Qualidade Assistencial, e por três vezes foi medalhista em desafios internacionais de aplicação de inteligência artificial no diagnóstico por imagem, propostos na conferência anual da Sociedade Norte-Americana de Radiologia, considerado o maior congresso do setor no mundo. Ao final de 2020, a Central de Laudos da FIDI obteve a certificação ISO 9001:2015 de Gestão da Qualidade, pela International Organization for Standardization.

Propósito

Nosso propósito na FIDI é Salvar Vidas é o que nos move. Trazer á luz o que os olhos daqueles que salvam precisam ver. Fazemos imagens que têm o poder de mudar a vida das pessoas, diariamente. Cada uma de nossas imagens conta uma história, e em cada história, fazemos a diferença.

E trazer inovação no diagnóstico, aprendendo e nos reinventando sempre. Com o objetivo de entregar cada vez mais e melhor. Com o orgulho de entregar para quem mais precisa, mesmo nas condições mais delicadas.

Não fazemos nada pela metade. Trabalhamos duro para valorizar os recursos que recebemos. E estamos sempre superando as expectativas, entregando além do combinado.

Nossa essência é servir.

Nosso legado é transformar positivamente tudo o que assumimos.

Especialmente vidas.
