Je maakt misschien wel de meest bijzondere artikelen van het Nederlandse medialandschap, bedenkt technische oplossingen om journalistieke vragen te beantwoorden en schrijft code met persoonlijkheid! We zoeken een ervaren frontend developer die digitale ervaringen bouwt die onze lezers niet alleen informeren, maar ook verrassen en vermaken.

Ons doel: Altijd Dichtbij

Wij vertalen grote nieuwsverhalen naar jouw dagelijkse leven, zodat je precies begrijpt wat het voor jou betekent. Neem bijvoorbeeld ""Dit zegt jouw geboortejaar over je toekomst"" we maakten het abstracte probleem van vergrijzing direct invoelbaar doordat je als lezer aan de hand van een voorspelling te zien krijgt wat de vergrijzing voor jóuw leven betekent. Of kijk naar ""Hoe één sms de hel deed losbreken in Hedel"", waarbij je in de schoenen staat van een afgeperste fruithandelaar en de dreigende sms'jes die hij ontving nu ook op jouw scherm verschijnen. Dat is onze missie ""Altijd Dichtbij"": geen afstandelijke analyses, maar verhalen die raken. Ook als de onderwerpen ingewikkeld of abstract zijn. Met jouw technische expertise help je om die meest waardevolle ervaring voor ons publiek te maken, van concept tot code.

Een nieuwe positie

Je maakt deel uit van een nieuw team onder leiding van Daniel Disselkoen, onze art director, samen met ontwerpers, een illustrator en beeldredacteuren. In samenwerking met redacteuren van verschillende redacties bouw je op de nieuwsvloer aan impactvolle online producties die zich onderscheiden van de reguliere nieuwsverhalen.

Wat ga je doen?


Bijzondere verhalen (specials) maken: van visuele longreads en interactieve kaarten tot quizzen en datagedreven producties.
Templates: maken van gebruiksvriendelijke templates waarmee niet-technische redacteuren interactieve verhalen kunnen maken.
Technologie selecteren en toepassen: kiezen van de juiste techniek voor elk verhaal, van Webflow voor redacteur-vriendelijke templates tot bijvoorbeeld Svelte Kit voor complexe datavisualisaties.
Aanspreekpunt zijn: als technisch expert ben je vraagbaak voor regionale redacties die met jouw templates aan de slag gaan.
Bruggen bouwen: Samenwerken met de product-afdeling om jouw specials naadloos te integreren in de bestaande website en app.
Innoveren in visuele journalistiek: nieuwe manieren ontdekken om lezers een rijkere ervaring te bieden.


Wat breng je mee?

Technische expertise


Minimaal 5 jaar ervaring met frontend-technologieën.
Vaardigheid met moderne frameworks.Kennis van Next.js is een grote pre.
Begrip van backend-ontwikkeling om effectief met de product-afdeling te kunnen samenwerken.
Pragmatische aanpak: je kiest de technologie die past bij het doel, niet andersom.
Ervaring met datavisualisatie (bijv. D3.js, Recharts of Chart.js).
Beheersing van Git en moderne build tools.
Begrip van webtoegankelijkheid en performance-optimalisatie.
Ervaring met diverse CMS-integraties.
Bekwaam in het effectief inzetten van AI-tools als ondersteuning bij je werk (maar je hebt wel diepgaande vakkennis, geen vibe-coder).


Persoonlijke kwaliteiten


Verhalend denken: je begrijpt wat een goed verhaal is en hoe technologie dit kan versterken.
Pionieren: je vindt het spannend om in een nieuw team nieuwe paden te bewandelen.
Pragmatisch: techniek is voor jou geen doel maar een middel om verhalen te vertellen.
Communicatief sterk: je kunt technische concepten uitleggen aan niet-technische collega's.
Nieuwsgierig: je blijft op de hoogte van innovaties in webdevelopment en digitale journalistiek.

We at Lumion make beautiful, high-performance desktop software for architectural visualization. Think: gorgeous buildings, smooth lighting, slick renders — the works. Now, we’re on a mission to develop some AI enhancements on top.

We're not trying to build the next ChatGPT or reinvent neural networks. We just want to make our app smarter — with clever, useful, jaw-droppingly cool features — using the powerful AI models already out there in the wild. That’s where you come in.

What You’ll Actually Do

You're not a lab researcher. You're a feature whisperer who knows how to make AI do things. You'll use open-source models (diffusion, GANs, vision transformers, etc.), evaluate a few APIs, glue things together, and help our users get magical results with minimal clicks.

Here are some things we’re dreaming about:

Turn a crappy photo into a stunning material.

Auto-generate textures or assets with zero human suffering.

Help users get better renders faster with upscaling, denoising, smart defaults.

Integrate AI into creative workflows without making it feel like AI is taking over the world (yet).

We’re Looking for Someone Who:

Has experience working with AI/ML in real-world, non-academic settings

Knows how to wrangle pre-trained models (PyTorch, ONNX, Hugging Face, etc.)

Loves building things, not just running experiments

Can work in Python, and ideally isn’t afraid of C++ (or people who use it)

Understands that “AI-enhanced” should never mean “mysteriously broken”

Bonus: You’ve played with 3D software, graphics pipelines, or materials/textures

Why You Might Like It Here

No infra-heavy LLM nonsense — just real features for real users

Small team, high trust, low politics

Ownership from day one: prototype, iterate, ship

We’re allergic to buzzwords, but not allergic to shipping cool stuff

 An attractive salary and bonus structure.

 Full-time contract.

 Flexible working hours (including working from home Wednesdays).

 30 vacation days per year.

 20 wor-cation schemes per year.

 Local Office Benefits: Free lunch and free office gym.

 The opportunity to work in an enthusiastic, international team, in a creative environment, focused on people, growth, and collaboration.

Friendly note:

Please do not make use of this vacancy as an acquisition opportunity.

Do you want to use your AI and data skills to optimize Employee Experience while helping well-known companies with their business performance? We are looking for people who enjoy turning complex data into understandable insights, are passionate about AI & data science and want to contribute to the development of HR technology.

Your work as an AI & Data Science intern at #Highberg

As an intern, you will work on exploring and prototyping an innovative AI solution that helps non-technical HR users work with complex HR data in a simple and intuitive way.

The core of the assignment: you will research and build a chat interface that allows users to query structured HR data from a data warehouse, without having to write SQL or needing technical prior knowledge.

In your research, you will explore questions such as:


How can we enable natural language queries on HR datasets using generative AI?
Which tools and technologies (e.g. Copilot, Azure OpenAI, LangChain, FastAPI) are best suited for this use case?
What are the options for integrating this solution into Power BI, including security aspects such as row-level security?
What does a reliable, explainable, and user-friendly solution look like in practice?


Although we already have ideas about possible tools and architectures, we deliberately keep the technology choice open. Together with colleagues, you will research and document various design options. The ultimate goal is integration of the assistant into Power BI, but your MVP may start as a stand-alone prototype.

With your work, you will contribute directly to our mission to make data-driven HR smarter, more accessible and future-proof.

What are we asking?


You are in the final year of a study at university level
You have experience with Python and SQL, and preferably a visualisation tool such as Power BI
Excellent communication skills in English, both written and oral
You are available for ≥4 days a week for at least 6 months and within 1 hour travel from our office in Amsterdam RAI


Who are you?


You have a passion for data, AI, programming, statistics/machine learning and research
You are enterprising, creative, flexible, results-oriented, accurate and socially adept
You get the best out of yourself in an environment where you are challenged to go outside your comfort zone and learn new things


What are we offering?


A good internship allowance (EUR 550 per month) and training courses worth several thousand euros
12.5 days' holiday (for a six-month full-time employment)
Starting from September or by mutual agreement
Supervision by an experienced data scientist
A pleasant working environment, short communication lines, focus on performance as a team and plenty of social activities such as get-togethers, sports activities and team meetings
Our office is located at the Zuidas in Amsterdam and is easily accessible by public transport. We ask you to work at the office a minimum of two days a week, but you are always welcome, whether it is for the good coffee, a game of table tennis or just for your colleagues


About The Team

You will join the People, Analytics & Research team, which is part of the Organisational & Sustainability Transformation Hub. The team consists of around 25 colleagues: consultants, researchers, data scientists and data engineers. A great team of smart and driven professionals, who are always there for you with a helping hand! We not only work hard together, but also have a lot of fun together - we organise social events and we do lots of fun activities, such as outings, Friday afternoon drinks and sports events.

We are happy to help

Snap je hoe je saaie, herhalende klusjes omtovert tot smooth workflows met tools als Zapier, Make, Power Automate en n8n? En ben je ook thuis in AI-tools zoals ChatGPT, Copilot, Perplexity en Gemini? Dan zoeken wij jou om ons AI-team te versterken!


Taken


Als AI specialist help je lokale bedrijven ontdekken wat AI voor hen kan betekenen, en zet je ideeën om in werkende oplossingen. Je gaat:





Slimme processen bouwen en automatiseren bij verschillende ondernemers (ja, lekker afwisselend en op locatie).


Actief, samen met het bedrijf, naar laaghangend fruit zoeken waar AI direct iets kan betekenen.


Niet alleen techniek, maar juist de mensen meenemen in verandering (want dat vinden wij minstens zo belangrijk).


Meehelpen om de tofste scale-up in Almkerk nóg beter te maken.


Gewoon lekker samenwerken, niet de hele dag thuis achter je scherm.



Vereisten


Wie ben jij?

Je bent praktisch met passie voor techniek en innovatie. Je snapt bedrijfsprocessen en je stroopt samen met klanten de mouwen op. Je denkt mee, vraagt door en maakt dingen echt.




Wat je in elk geval moet kunnen:





Processen analyseren en structureren om vervolgens te automatiseren.


Makkelijk schakelen tussen klantvraag en technische oplossingen.


Goed kunt uitleggen wat AI is, ook aan mensen zonder technische achtergrond.


Je bent zelfstandig, maar je zoekt ook zeker de samenwerking op.


Actief werken met LLM’s (zoals OpenAI, Anthropic, of andere bestaande modellen).





Bonuspunten als je:





Verder kijkt dan alleen ChatGPT en ervaring hebt met andere LLM’s.


Al eens gewerkt hebt aan automatiseringsoplossingen voor bedrijven


Weet hoe je eigen modellen kunt trainen en finetunen.



Benefits



Een energiek team van bijna 20 collega’s die net zo enthousiast zijn als jij.


Werken voor gave klanten met uitdagende projecten.


Veel kansen om te leren, te groeien en jezelf te ontwikkelen.


Prima arbeidsvoorwaarden (maar dat vind je logisch, toch?).





Stuur je cv en een korte video waarin je jezelf voorstelt. Niet verplicht, wel leuk. Geen regisseur nodig, geen script, gewoon wie jij bent. Past dit niet bij je? Dan mag je natuurlijk ook gewoon iets anders insturen. Zolang het maar écht van jou is, niet van ChatGPT of een andere LLM😉

Excellent communication skills
Available for at least 4 months




What do we have to offer?

Being a small team, we still have the special start up/scale up vibe. However, we are growing fast, and with this growth, we face many challenges. This also gives you the opportunity to be part of that growth through your internship to kick-start your career.

At loadmaster, we believe that our customers will need a long term partnership for their digitization and process optimization. That results in a variety of problems thrown at us, and thus a very dynamic environment. No two weeks will be the same.

The start of the internship can be flexible. It can be done full time or 4 days a week part-time, combined with your thesis or studies. The place of work will be Marconiplein 16 Rotterdam in the Netherlands and has to be physical for at least 2 days a week. We will pay you a monthly stipend. If we’re a good match, we’ll consider you for a full-time role following the internship.

Business Intelligence & Kwaliteit (BI&K) Midden-Nederland heeft ruimte voor een ervaren en praktijkgerichte business analist die een bijdrage aan de veiligheid in Nederland gaat leveren.

Wat ga je doen?

Als business analist ben je verantwoordelijk voor het beantwoorden van (complexe) informatieverzoeken. Je bent daarbij de verbindende schakel tussen de Business Intelligence (BI) Afdeling en de operatie. Je bent verantwoordelijk voor het in behandeling nemen van de informatieverzoeken. Je beoordeelt en prioriteert vanuit je kennis van en vaardigheid in het identificeren van business eisen en wensen, organisatiestructuren en processen. Ook voer je vooronderzoeken uit, stelt business requirements op en verbindt deze aan intelligence- zelfstandig of in samenwerking met andere specialisten zoals de informatieanalist en/of ontwikkelaar, data scientist.

Waar ga je werken?

De DRIO Midden-Nederland is een dynamische dienst die bestaat uit meer dan 350 medewerkers die 24/7 de politieorganisatie en haar partners voorzien van actuele intelligence. Binnen de DRIO Midden Nederland vertrouwen we op de kennis van onze specialisten en krijg je de ruimte om te zijn wie je bent. De verschillende teams dragen op hun eigen wijze, met eigen middelen, bronnen en specifieke kennis aan actuele intelligence. Met deze bijdragen wil de DRIO richtinggevend zijn bij zowel veiligheidsvraagstukken als in opsporingsonderzoeken.

Om dit doel te bereiken zijn verschillende collega’s werkzaam binnen deze dataopgave, waaronder de Afdeling BI&K. Je komt te werken bij het Team Business Intelligence. Dit team houdt zich bezig met


het ontwikkelen en beheren van standaardinformatieproducten en analyseoplossingen, waaronder landelijke applicatie;
het genereren van de juiste informatie uit data;
de ontwikkeling van informatieposities op actuele thema’s;
de ontwikkeling en het beheren van de landelijke applicatie t.b.v. intelligence.


Het team waar je komt te werken experimenteert met innovatieve methodieken. Je werkt samen in een regionaal team van business intelligence specialisten. Samen met jouw collega’s denk je buiten de bestaande kaders om te komen tot realistische en passende oplossingen. Daarnaast houd je landelijk contact met vakgenoten in de andere eenheden. Hoewel de standplaats Utrecht is, verricht het team werkzaamheden door het hele land.

Wie ben jij?

Wij zoeken iemand die de verbindende schakel is naar de operatie en het een uitdaging vindt om de vraag achter de vraag te achterhalen. Je wilt complexe veiligheids- en datavraagstukken aanpakken met jouw brede kennis. Je bent nieuwsgierig van aard, creatief, praktijkgericht en netwerken is jouw tweede natuur. Hiermee bedoelen we dat je proactief acteert, oplossingsgericht denkt, initiatief durft te nemen en een openhouding hebt voor andermans kennis en meningen. Analytisch ben je ijzersterk en je hebt uitstekende adviestechnieken. Je maakt gemakkelijk verbinding met de operatie en externe partners, zoekt samenwerkingsverbanden en houdt actuele informatie op landelijk niveau bij. Je hebt een klantgerichte houding en je deelt kennis graag met je collega’s. Je benadert zaken fundamenteel en methodisch. Verder beschik je over uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden zowel mondeling als schriftelijk waarbij je weet om te gaan met weerstand.

Bij (verbeter)projecten werk je gestructureerd, ben je gericht op samenwerking, en dienstverlenend. Je werkt mee aan de realisatie van projecten waarbij je deel uitmaakt van multidisciplinaire teams. Om je rol succesvol te vervullen heb je oog voor details, behoeften van de organisatie en voor de innovaties in het land en binnen de andere diensten. Vervolgens gaat het je gemakkelijk af om de behoeftes van eindgebruikers te vertalen naar bestaande of nieuwe product/services. Hier speel je een actieve rol in waardoor je een sleutelrol vervult en er van jou verwacht wordt om goed in verbinding te staan met je collega’s.

Je bent in staat om informatie op een heldere en aantrekkelijke manier te presenteren aan een publiek. Je hebt overtuigingskracht en bent een echte verbinder die gemakkelijk contact legt met partijen die verschillende belangen hebben. Je weet diverse vragen goed te vertalen naar creatieve en bruikbare oplossingen. Je bent nauwgezet en precies. Je bent sociaal vaardig en ruimdenkend. Je werkt graag samen, staat open voor feedback en kunt zelfstandig werken.

Verder beschik je over


hbo werk- en denkniveau*;
conceptuele kennis van business intelligence;
ervaring met business analyse, BI architectuur en BI tools;
bij voorkeur ervaring met de volgende onderwerpen business en/of informatieanalyse, SQL, datawarehousing, programmeertalen bijv. Python, Cognos, big data analyse of datavisualisatie;
bij voorkeur kennis van de politieorganisatie.

Jij bent een flexibele, belangrijke wissel met verkoopskills

Jij staat paraat als je collega’s uitvallen of als we op drukke momenten hulp nodig hebben, dan kom jij vol energie de winkelvloer op rennen. Klaar voor de wedstrijd van de dag! Je werkt op de drukste dagen en en springt bij waar nodig, je bent daarmee onmisbaar in het team. Als sportliefhebber is het voor jou een eitje om je enthousiasme over te brengen op onze klanten. Dat is precies waar je kracht ligt!

Dit ga je doen

In het weekend, in de vakantie en wanneer je tijd en zin hebt, help jij onze klanten de juiste producten te scoren. Je beantwoordt vragen en geeft het juiste advies. Is er even geen klant om van dienst te kunnen zijn? Dan zorg je ervoor dat de winkel er tiptop uitziet.

Je staat bekend om je humor en enthousiasme
Voor jou staat de klant altijd op nummer één
Je weet van aanpakken en ziet het als de winkel niet netjes is
Je wilt bijverdienen op elk vrij moment van de week ( elke dienst is minimaal 3 uur).


Dit is je winst


Een warm welkom in een energiek, groeiend bedrijf
Een motiverende werksfeer waar je je vernieuwende ideeën kwijt kunt
Alle kansen om met ons mee te groeien
Een goed salaris waar ook nog vakantiegeld en eventuele reiskostenvergoeding bij komen.
Goede secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden
Personeelskorting op al onze merken
Leuke collega’s die altijd in zijn voor een potje darten of een gezellige vrijdagmiddagborrel.

Het Trimbos-instituut voert in het najaar van 2025 het landelijke EXPLORE-onderzoek uit. Voor dit onderzoek zoeken we flexibele onderzoeksassistenten die scholen bezoeken om klassikaal vragenlijsten af te nemen bij scholieren. De werkzaamheden vinden plaats vanaf half september t/m eind november (met eventuele uitloop in december).

🔹Wat houdt het EXPLORE-onderzoek in?🔹

Het EXPLORE-onderzoek is een landelijk onderzoek naar roken, vapen, alcohol- en drugsgebruik en het (digitale) welzijn van scholieren in het praktijkonderwijs en het voortgezet speciaal onderwijs (cluster 4). Ook stellen we vragen over sociale mediagebruik, gamen en gokken. Dit onderzoek is voor het laatst in 2019 uitgevoerd. Hoog tijd om het onderzoek te herhalen! De resultaten zijn belangrijk voor beleid en preventieprogramma’s zoals de Gezonde school en Rookvrije Generatie.

🔹Wat ga je doen als onderzoeksassistent?🔹

Er zijn bijna 70 scholen die zich hebben aangemeld voor dit onderzoek. Jij bent als onderzoeksassistent verantwoordelijk voor de afname van het onderzoek bij de scholen in jouw regio! De belangrijkste taken voor jou zijn:



Contact opnemen met de scholen om de vragenlijstafnames in te plannen (eind september/begin oktober).
Klassikaal vragenlijsten afnemen bij scholieren (in oktober/november). Dit doe je met eigen vervoer (fiets, auto of OV).
Bijhouden van administratie over de afname (formulieren invullen, wekelijkse terugkoppeling van voortgang aan het Trimbos-instituut).
Aanwezig zijn bij de instructiebijeenkomst over het onderzoek. Dit vindt plaats op maandag 15 september van 14 tot 17 uur op het Trimbos-instituut in Utrecht.



🔹Hoeveel uur ga je werken?🔹

Het aantal uur dat onderzoeksassistenten wekelijks werken, varieert en is afhankelijk van de planning van de vragenlijstafnames. Gemiddeld kun je rekenen op 3 tot 4 uur per week (afhankelijk van het aantal scholen) over een periode van ongeveer 2,5 maand. De werkdruk is echter niet elke week hetzelfde. Zo kan het voorkomen dat je in een drukke week 14 uur werkt (bijvoorbeeld als je twee scholen bezoekt), terwijl je in een rustige week slechts 2 uur bezig bent (bijvoorbeeld voor het maken van afspraken met scholen).

Wat we je bieden



Een leuke en flexibele parttimebaan in het najaar, perfect naast je studie of huidige (bij)baan!
Een bruto uurloon van €18,49
Volledige vergoeding voor de instructiebijeenkomst op 15 september

Since 2014, Acast has been building the world’s most valuable podcast marketplace, creating the technology that connects podcast creators, advertisers, and listeners. Its marketplace spans more than 140,000 podcasts, 3,300 advertisers, and one billion quarterly listens. Crucially, those listens are monetized wherever they happen—across any podcast app or listening platform.

About The Role

We are looking for a Software Engineer for the Acast Intelligence team. The ideal candidate would be able to build things like a modern recommendation engine, truly understanding it instead of just piecing it together, probably thanks to a solid background in statistics or related fields. We’re after someone who can cut through the hype, focus on real value that LLMs and related tech can bring, and always keep their eyes on the prize: driving growth for our company and our marketplace’s users.

Team’s scope

The team is focused on recommendation systems and intelligent automation. Our product vision is a set of connected systems that turn deep and broad data into decisions and reduce friction, helping one person achieve as much as five would. We build to enable podcast creators to grow their audience, advertisers to be matched to creators, and internal teams to focus on what matters most instead of getting bogged down in chasing data.

This work has a company-wide impact.

Team composition and tools

The team is small but made up of seasoned engineers. We deploy on AWS, and most of our company’s code is in TypeScript, including the infrastructure, but some of this particular team’s code is in Python for the reasons you’d expect. We collaborate on our projects and keep the work process light. Our PM knows the space in and out. We’ve shipped the first version of a recommendation engine, and there’s plenty more in the pipeline. There aren’t many established best practices or ready answers in this field, so the work is a lot about experimentation and learning.

Experience we’re looking for


Background and interest in some of the following: statistics, machine learning, LLMs, recommendation systems, RAG systems (experience with their evaluation is a plus)
Proficiency in Python, familiarity with TypeScript (or the other way around)
Familiarity with vector databases
A habit of staying up to date in a seriously evolving field
Experience with or interest in learning AWS
Experience building software that’s actually delightful for the users
A pragmatic mindset for making sensible trade-offs
Interest in podcasts is really optional, but if you have it, this job will be so much more fun


Logistics

We are remote-first but prefer to have teams in similar timezones; for this team, this means an overlap of at least 4 hours with CET (UTC+1).


For this role we’re hiring within Sweden or UK, and therefore applicants will need to have the right to work in one of these locations.


Culture

Acast is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, national origin or any of the other wonderful characteristics that make us different.

Culture is our number one priority as a business. We believe people come first, and we work every day to enable autonomy, continuous improvement and bring out the best in people. We’re global and have remote teams, so it’s even more important that we strive for an open, inclusive and caring environment where everyone feels visible and welcome.

We consider ourselves a modern organization driven by strong values to create the best, most fulfilling and nurturing culture.

We very much look forward to finding the next great person to join our cause!

Mynt is an all-in-one corporate card and spend management solution, on a mission to fundamentally change business banking forever. Our digital software, coupled with corporate cards and payments infrastructure, eradicates manual administrative tasks relating to spending for businesses. Mynt is experiencing huge growth in the Nordic markets, serving over 16,000 business customers. We have recently secured substantial funding to support our continued expansion in Sweden and internationally.




Mynt is a tech-first company with a product oriented mindset, empowering teams to be their best in ideating and creating innovative solutions to complex problems. In 2021, Mynt obtained financial license as an E-money institution, card issuer, and payment processor from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.




Since 2022, we’ve launched several strategic partnerships, starting with Fortnox where we integrated corporate cards directly into their platform. In early 2023, we announced a similar partnership with Accountor Group in Finland. Since then, additional integrations have gone live — including Kleer and Wint. Additional partnerships are in progress and under development.




Joining Mynt means contributing to creating an exceptional product and company. We seek passionate individuals who thrive in a fast-paced environment, prioritizing customer value. With around 70 employees (and growing fast), we plan to further expand our team to support our growth.




About the Role

Mynt is now looking for a top performer with a strong drive and creative goal-oriented mindset to work with business data analytics. You will be expected to work closely with the CPO and leadership team to analyze and visualize a multitude of data, building on our existing ETL and analytics pipeline.




You need to have a strong interest in working in a dynamic and ambitious startup environment and have strong analytical and technical skills. You should have solid experience of data analytics.




What you’ll be diving into:

Work extensively with our internal customer and marketing data to deliver sharp and actionable insight to several functions at Mynt
Work closely with senior leaders in business areas to understand the mechanics of each area
Pro-actively develop business hypotheses and be prepared to test these with data
Develop machine learning models for predictive analyses




What you bring to the table:

Experience in SQL and python or similar languages
Bachelor's or Master's degree
Fluent in Swedish and English




What we can offer you:

Be part of an amazing team in a fast-growing scale-up.
Work closely with a fun, high-performing team.
Enjoy a flexible working environment with a great office location in central Stockholm.
Shape your own development and responsibilities based on your passion and interest.

The position will be filled as soon as we find a suitable candidate. Please reach out to us as soon as possible if you believe this for you!

Bumbee Labs är ett innovativt techbolag i scale-up-fasen som gör avtryck globalt med vår unika produkt. Vi har utvecklat en unik metod för att mäta och analysera flödesdata – att förstå hur människor rör sig och beter sig – med hjälp av Wi-Fi-teknologi.

Vår kärnprodukt är data – men ännu viktigare är de insikter vi skapar av den.




Din roll

Som Data Scientist kommer du att vara en del av vårt analysteam och arbeta praktiskt med att förädla vår data, utveckla modeller och säkerställa att våra leveranser håller hög kvalitet. Du kommer att bidra till att förbättra våra metoder för kalibrering, validering och analys – och därigenom skapa ännu bättre insikter för våra kunder.

Du arbetar nära våra utvecklare, implementationsteam och kundansvariga för att förstå både den tekniska sidan och kundernas behov. Rollen är en blandning av analys, problemlösning och samarbete.




Ansvarsområden
Analysera och bearbeta stora datamängder
Bidra till utveckling och förbättring av statistiska modeller
Stödja vid uppsättning och kalibrering av nya installationer
Säkerställa datakvalitet och bidra till validering av resultat
Samarbeta med kollegor för att omsätta kundernas behov i datadrivna lösningar
Bidra med insikter och underlag till visualiseringar (t.ex. i Power BI), men utan krav på att själv bygga dashboards




Vem vi söker

Du är analytisk, noggrann och tycker om att arbeta med data i olika former. Du är nyfiken på hur människor rör sig i fysiska miljöer och vill använda din kompetens till att skapa insikter som gör skillnad.

Vi ser gärna att du har:

Erfarenhet av dataanalys och statistisk modellering
Programmeringsvana i Python
Kunskap i PostgreSQL och gärna PostGIS
Intresse för geospatial data och mobilitetsmönster
Viss erfarenhet av datavisualisering (Power BI, Tableau eller liknande) är meriterande, men inget krav




Vår kultur

På Bumbee Labs kombinerar vi djup teknisk kompetens med en kreativ och samarbetsinriktad arbetsmiljö. Vi brainstormar, testar och utmanar idéer varje dag – och vi har kul längs vägen. Vårt kontor ligger i hjärtat av Stockholm, där kreativitet och innovation får utrymme att blomma.




Vill du vara med och utveckla framtidens platsanalys med hjälp av Wi-Fi-data? Skicka in din ansökan och bli en del av vårt team.

We believe in the power of content not just as a way of telling stories and touching lives, but also expanding worlds.  

We’re looking for the best people to join us on our journey. Right now, we’re searching for a Data Scientist in our Stockholm office – are you ready to hit play on an exciting career change? 

The Role 

We’re looking for a Data Scientist who’s passionate about using data to shape how millions of people experience entertainment. At Viaplay, our data science team works at the heart of personalization, customer engagement, and product innovation.

In this role, you’ll help design and evaluate models, uncover insights, and collaborate closely with engineers, product managers, and content teams to bring ideas to life. From improving recommendations to understanding user behavior, your work will directly impact how our audiences connect with Viaplay.

This is a great opportunity if you enjoy problem-solving, experimentation, and storytelling with data and want to grow your skills in a supportive, collaborative environment.

What You’ll Be Doing


Design, train, and deploy machine learning and statistical models for recommendations, predictions, and classifications
Translate business questions into data-driven problems and deliver clear, actionable insights
Collaborate with product, engineering, content, commercial, and marketing teams to shape data-informed decisions
Analyze large datasets to understand user behavior, content performance, and platform trends
Work with engineers to bring models into production and monitor their performance
Share knowledge, learn from others, and contribute to a culture of curiosity and experimentation


What We’re Looking For 

We understand you may feel confident ticking certain boxes more than others and that’s why we always keep an open mind in our recruitment process. But, in order to thrive in this role, we do believe you’ll have at least some experience in the following: 


3+ years of hands-on experience in applied Data Science or Machine Learning
Experience running projects end-to-end: framing problems, prototyping models, and analyzing performance
Proficiency in Python and SQL, experience with data transformation using Spark
Strong analytical and statistical skills, with experience designing experiments or A/B tests
Knowledge of data pipeline tools such as Airflow or similar
Clear communication skills, able to translate complex results into simple, actionable insights
A background in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, or another quantitative field (or equivalent practical experience)


It’s a bonus if you have: 


Experience with recommender systems, personalization, or content optimization
Familiarity with causal inference methods
Understanding of MLOps practices and collaboration with ML Engineers
Experience in media, streaming, or e-commerce


What we offer you


We’ve got you covered! 30 days of paid vacation every year, an attractive pension and insurance scheme, and generous parental leave pay lift.
Your wellbeing matters. We provide you with various wellbeing initiatives including wellness allowance.
Flexibility that works. We follow a hybrid model with three days a week in the office and the rest remote, giving you the best of collaboration and focus time.
A safe space to grow and up-skill. Our learning culture puts you in the driver’s seat of your own development.
An innovative environment with Hack Days once a year. This week-long initiative allows you to think outside the box and deliver creative, technical solutions that (more often than not) go on to be implemented, either in our product or our ways of working.
Entertainment is what we love, and entertainment is what we do. So, unlimited access to Viaplay seems only fair for you to get to know the product – including serier & viewing events, new release movie rentals, linear channels and more.

AI + Apotea = <heart/>




Apotea is Sweden’s leading online pharmacy, committed to making healthcare accessible and efficient for everyone. Our Data and AI team is at the heart of innovation, building AI and ML applications that enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and create a foundation for future innovations. We are seeking passionate and driven individuals who are eager to make a significant impact and be part of a small technical team. By following industry best practices, we develop end to end AI applications on top of modern data and AI architectures, making sure our AI products don't end up just being a POC and drive sustainable value in production. The AI organization sits right under CEO Pär Svärdson, ensuring that your work has high visibility and significant influence.




Your role as a Machine Learning Engineer at Apotea:

Build, deploy, and own end-to-end ML systems – from prototyping to maintaining production models, ensuring scalability, reliability, and alignment with team strategy.
Turn models into real-world solutions – integrate ML into products that deliver measurable business value.
Apply MLOps and DevOps best practices – use CI/CD, IaC, and cloud native solutions to deploy and monitor models.
Collaborate across teams – work with Data Engineers, Software Engineers, Tech Lead, and Product Owner to align on data, integrations, architecture, and goals.
Define metrics and evaluation processes - establish performance metrics, evaluation and validation frameworks aligned with business logic and requirements
Take proactive initiatives - continuously identify and implement improvements to boost team productivity and solution quality
Mentor junior engineers - provide technical guidance, code reviews, and care for the junior engineers in the team.




Who you are?

We’re seeking Machine Learning Engineers with diverse skills and a passion for solving complex problems and business impact.




You’re an ML EXPERT who:

• Ships models to production, not just notebooks

• Speaks the language of both algorithms and business KPIs

• Stays ahead of the curve on AI/ML breakthroughs

• Is proficient in Python and ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.




You’re an ENGINEER who:

• Writes code that outlasts the current project

• Thinks in systems, not just scripts

• Tests obsessively (A/B testing solutions, End-to-End testing softwares) and documents proactively

• Knows cloud infra like the back of your hand (AWS preferred)




Bonus points for experience with:

• Implementing CI/CD pipelines, MLOps practices, and infrastructure-as-code for robust and repeatable deployments

• Feature stores and real-time inference pipelines

• Open data formats like Delta Lake or Iceberg

• Swedish language skills (not required, but a plus)




What Apotea Offer You

The chance to work on cutting-edge AI and ML projects that impact millions of customers.
Join a flat, agile organization with minimal bureaucracy
Drive sustainability through eco-friendly packaging and logistics
Opportunities for career growth through training, mentorship, and industry conferences.
Collaborate in a cross-functional, transparent environment
Own projects from concept to deployment
A stable, future-focused company with a meaningful mission to improve healthcare accessibility.

Aira is here to change that.

With our intelligent Aira Heat Pump at the heart, we’re making the switch to clean energy-tech easier and more affordable. Helping Europe turn off gas and slashing energy costs one home at a time.

Founded in 2022, and with 1000+ employees and counting, Aira is driving the clean energy revolution by providing homes with modern clean energy-tech solutions such as solar power, battery storage solutions, and heat pumps. With a state-of-the-art production facility in Poland, an HQ in Stockholm, Sweden, and hubs across the UK, Germany, and Italy, Aira is well on track to install clean energy-tech into 5 million homes by 2034.

About The Role 

Join our growing Energy Optimisation team as a Machine Learning Engineer (full-time, in-house) and help build and maintain the models that make up Aira’s intelligent home energy management system. By connecting our customers’ Aira devices - solar, batteries, heat pumps, and EV chargers - our system personalises energy management, adapts to customer preferences, usage patterns, and external factors like weather forecasts and energy tariffs, all with the mission to reduce energy bills and cut CO₂ emissions.

This role combines technical work with a product mindset. You'll dive into the details of machine learning models and energy optimisation, while also shaping the customer experience: how do we balance cost and comfort, how do we build trust in our intelligence, and how do we make our models understandable and explainable to our customers?

You’ll be joining a fast-moving, small team with high ownership. We’re looking for an ML Engineer comfortable working across the full data stack, who brings a product mindset, strong collaboration skills, and a drive to turn complex models into everyday value for our customers.

What You’ll Be Doing



Apply your mathematical and ML knowledge to solve real-world energy problems.
Develop optimisation models balancing dynamic tariffs, weather forecasts, customer behaviour, and preferences to achieve the perfect balance between cost savings and comfort for each individual customer and home.
Design, build, productionise, and iterate on Aira’s energy optimisation models
Collaborate with product designers, software, and hardware engineers to co-create features that will make our customers love their Aira products and save more money on their energy bills.
Test new approaches quickly, learn from results, and scale up the ones that make a difference



What You’ll Bring To The Role



You’re energized by fast-moving, product-driven environments where progress matters and the customer perspective guides our decisions.
You’re motivated by impact - what matters is not the perfect model, but the value it gives to the customer.
You have a background in machine learning, enjoy applying theory to develop real-world applications, with experience in reinforcement learning, general neural networks, and/or other methods relevant to personalisation and optimisation problems.
You have strong coding skills and have built ML systems in production, ideally using Python, Java, or similar. Familiarity with tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn is beneficial but not required.
You’re comfortable working with large-scale data pipelines, orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow), stream processing (e.g., Kafka), and cloud platforms (e.g., GCP or AWS).
You're ready to take initiative and accountability, and you're able to lead or contribute to high-stakes technical discussions.
You're open to working primarily from our Stockholm office



What is in it for you?



Gain hands-on experience in a fast-growing scale-up, with a supportive and inclusive culture, and career advancement opportunities.
Collaborate with diverse teams across international markets and launch products globally.
Develop and grow personally and professionally in an entrepreneurial-minded environment.
Thrive in a dynamic, solution-oriented culture, tackling challenges and driving meaningful solutions that make a positive impact on the world.
Influence the company's success, with a visible impact on product development and market growth.
Enjoy our brand-new office at Norra Stationsgatan 93 in Stockholm. Conveniently located near public transport, with Sankt Eriksplan and Odenplan stations just a few minutes walk away.



At Aira, we champion next-generation energy as well as diversity and inclusion. We firmly believe that a diverse workforce fosters innovation and creativity, enhancing our ability to serve customers and communities effectively. We welcome individuals from all backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives to join our team. Our commitment is to uphold equality and inclusivity, fostering a collaborative environment where everyone can thrive and contribute to a better future for our people and the planet.

Do you like the challenge of taking something that works in theory and making it useful in practice? At Framna, we’re looking for an AI Engineer who’s as curious as they are collaborative. Someone who can dive into supporting structures, such as evaluation frameworks and models, but also explain their findings in a way that makes sense to the rest of us. If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you on the team!




Become part of the team




Framna partners with some of the world’s most ambitious brands, like Swish, SJ, Essity, and SEB, to create digital products that define markets and deliver real-world impact. We’re now more than 500 people across eight studios, building apps used by millions every day.

As an AI Engineer here, you’ll sit in the middle of it all. Some days you’ll be prototyping new ideas with colleagues. Other days you’ll be building the services that take those ideas into production. Sometimes you’ll be the one explaining to a partner what’s actually possible with AI right now. And throughout it all, you’ll have a network of other AI enthusiasts across Framna to share, test, and learn with.




What you will do




This is a role for someone who likes variety. It’s about figuring out where AI actually adds value and then building it into products that people can trust and enjoy.




More specifically, you’ll:

Explore and apply LLMs and Generative AI, including multi-modal capabilities.
Build pipelines for training, testing, deployment, monitoring, and scaling models.
Decide when to go custom and when to use existing tools.
Fine-tune models and design data pipelines to keep them running smoothly.
Share your discoveries with colleagues and partners so everyone levels up.
Contribute to pitches and presentations when we explore new opportunities.
Lead internal projects that use AI to make Framna smarter and more efficient.




Who you are




There’s no single background that makes you right for this role. What matters is how you think, how you build, and how you work with others. You might recognize yourself here if you:




Get curious about the latest AI developments and enjoy testing them out.
Like solving complex problems and turning experiments into something reliable.
Can explain technical things in a way that makes sense to non-technical people.
Enjoy working in a team where different perspectives make the product better.
Care about building AI that’s fair, inclusive, and genuinely useful.




About Framna




Framna means ‘to bring forward’ in Old Norse. And that is exactly what we do. We partner with industry leaders (and those about to be) to create excellent digital products that define markets, reshape industries, and deliver meaningful impact.

Born from the union of digital agencies Bontouch, Move, and Shape, Framna emerged from a strong, product-led culture. Today, over 500 of us collaborate across eight studios in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the US.

Every day, millions of users around the world rely on the products we help shape. From seamless payments to daily commutes, from better health management to smarter shopping. Our work supports more than €150 million in daily transactions and consistently earns an average App Store rating of 4.5.

Together with some of the world’s most ambitious brands, including Essity, SJ, Swish, and SEB, we craft products that lead markets and push boundaries. Because when products win, businesses win. We call it Win by product.




What you get




A studio worth leaving home for. Our Stockholm office is right in the middle of the city - a super cozy space where there’s always something happening, whether it’s a demo, a fika, or someone testing out a new idea. We mix that with the freedom to work from home when it makes sense, and hours that flex around real life.
A culture of curiosity. On Fridays we have weekly demos, Wednesdays mean lunch-and-learns, and sometimes we throw ourselves into conceptathons just to see what happens. We gather for company conferences just to share ideas, and we take time to learn something new when needed.
The freedom to follow your “what if.” We believe the best roles are shaped by the people in them. If you’re curious about something, you’ll have the trust and space to chase it, and probably a few teammates who want to jump in with you.
Teammates who bring their whole selves. Designers who doodle during standups, engineers who can’t resist showing off a clever hack, product leads who keep the energy up when things get tricky. Around here, people genuinely like sharing what they know and celebrating when someone tries something new.
And of course, the benefits you’d expect. A generous wellness grant, top-up on your parental leave, occupational pension, and plenty more to make life outside of work easier.

Bumbee Labs är ett innovativt techbolag i scale-up-fasen som gör avtryck globalt med vår unika produkt. Vi har utvecklat en unik metod för att mäta och analysera flödesdata – att förstå hur människor rör sig och beter sig – med hjälp av Wi-Fi-teknologi.

Vår kärnprodukt är data – men ännu viktigare är de insikter vi skapar av den.




Din roll

Som Data Scientist kommer du att vara en del av vårt analysteam och arbeta praktiskt med att förädla vår data, utveckla modeller och säkerställa att våra leveranser håller hög kvalitet. Du kommer att bidra till att förbättra våra metoder för kalibrering, validering och analys – och därigenom skapa ännu bättre insikter för våra kunder.

Du arbetar nära våra utvecklare, implementationsteam och kundansvariga för att förstå både den tekniska sidan och kundernas behov. Rollen är en blandning av analys, problemlösning och samarbete.




Ansvarsområden
Analysera och bearbeta stora datamängder
Bidra till utveckling och förbättring av statistiska modeller
Stödja vid uppsättning och kalibrering av nya installationer
Säkerställa datakvalitet och bidra till validering av resultat
Samarbeta med kollegor för att omsätta kundernas behov i datadrivna lösningar
Bidra med insikter och underlag till visualiseringar (t.ex. i Power BI), men utan krav på att själv bygga dashboards




Vem vi söker

Du är analytisk, noggrann och tycker om att arbeta med data i olika former. Du är nyfiken på hur människor rör sig i fysiska miljöer och vill använda din kompetens till att skapa insikter som gör skillnad.

Vi ser gärna att du har:

Erfarenhet av dataanalys och statistisk modellering
Programmeringsvana i Python
Kunskap i PostgreSQL och gärna PostGIS
Intresse för geospatial data och mobilitetsmönster
Viss erfarenhet av datavisualisering (Power BI, Tableau eller liknande) är meriterande, men inget krav




Vår kultur

På Bumbee Labs kombinerar vi djup teknisk kompetens med en kreativ och samarbetsinriktad arbetsmiljö. Vi brainstormar, testar och utmanar idéer varje dag – och vi har kul längs vägen. Vårt kontor ligger i hjärtat av Stockholm, där kreativitet och innovation får utrymme att blomma.




Vill du vara med och utveckla framtidens platsanalys med hjälp av Wi-Fi-data? Skicka in din ansökan och bli en del av vårt team.

WHAT YOU’LL DO

As a CRM Data Scientist within the Loyalty & CRM team under Market Activation, you will be at the forefront of recruiting, onboarding and developing customers through our loyalty and membership program. In this global role, your contributions will have a direct and significant impact on our brand strategy. Your key responsibilities will include:


Analyze customer data to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for improvement in CRM strategies

Who You’ll Work With

Loyalty is built through every aspect of our company, from the products we create and the brand we represent to the experiences we offer. When we talk about ‘Loyalty’, we leverage two key enablers to inform our strategies and tactics: our Membership program and our CRM capabilities. Membership ensures identification and engagement of our member base, building a direct relationship with our customers. Through CRM activities, we increase the value of customer interactions and drive positive customer base development, generating incremental sales. 

The Marketing Activation Unit within Marketing is tasked with creating a strategic plan that brings our brand direction to life across various touchpoints. Leveraging data and customer insights, we design comprehensive plans that ensure a seamless and holistic customer experience.

To thrive in this role, you bring strong analytical thinking, excellent communication skills, and a collaborative mindset. You’re comfortable working in fast-paced environments, translating complex data into actionable insights, and contributing meaningfully to cross-functional teams. You’re confident presenting your ideas and solutions to both technical and non-technical stakeholders and are eager to grow your impact through hands-on work and continuous learning.

We’re looking for candidates who have:


A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Economics, Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.
3–5 years of experience in data analysis, machine learning, and working with CRM systems.
Proficiency in Python and SQL, with the ability to write clean, production-ready code and participate in code reviews.
Applied knowledge in statistics and machine learning, including model evaluation and optimization.
Familiarity with Agile development methodologies and version control systems like Git.
Strong communication skills to present insights and ML solutions to diverse audiences.
A proactive approach to working independently while collaborating effectively within cross-functional product teams.



And people who are:


Hands-on with customer segmentation, churn prediction, and recommendation systems.
Familiar with CRM platforms such as Adobe, Salesforce, or HubSpot.
Experienced with cloud platforms (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP) and big data tools (e.g., Spark, Hadoop).
Able to translate business problems into machine learning solutions and define appropriate evaluation metrics.
Interested in contributing to Communities of Practice or mentoring junior colleagues as part of your growth journey.

Why apply to Apotea via fika ai?

Take our 20-minute AI interview to stand out. Instead of just a CV, you’ll show who you really are - how you reason, communicate, and solve problems. It's the best way to stand out in a sea of CVs. Your video interview will be shared with the hiring team at Apotea!




AI + Apotea = <heart/>




Apotea is Sweden’s leading online pharmacy, committed to making healthcare accessible and efficient for everyone. Our Data and AI team is at the heart of innovation, building AI and ML applications that enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and create a foundation for future innovations. We are seeking passionate and driven individuals who are eager to make a significant impact and be part of a small technical team. By following industry best practices, we develop end to end AI applications on top of modern data and AI architectures, making sure our AI products don't end up just being a POC and drive sustainable value in production. The AI organization sits right under CEO Pär Svärdson, ensuring that your work has high visibility and significant influence.




Your role as a Machine Learning Engineer at Apotea:

Build, deploy, and own end-to-end ML systems – from prototyping to maintaining production models, ensuring scalability, reliability, and alignment with team strategy.
Turn models into real-world solutions – integrate ML into products that deliver measurable business value.
Apply MLOps and DevOps best practices – use CI/CD, IaC, and cloud native solutions to deploy and monitor models.
Collaborate across teams – work with Data Engineers, Software Engineers, Tech Lead, and Product Owner to align on data, integrations, architecture, and goals.
Define metrics and evaluation processes - establish performance metrics, evaluation and validation frameworks aligned with business logic and requirements
Take proactive initiatives - continuously identify and implement improvements to boost team productivity and solution quality
Mentor junior engineers - provide technical guidance, code reviews, and care for the junior engineers in the team.




Who you are?

We’re seeking Machine Learning Engineers with diverse skills and a passion for solving complex problems and business impact.




You’re an ML EXPERT who:

• Ships models to production, not just notebooks

• Speaks the language of both algorithms and business KPIs

• Stays ahead of the curve on AI/ML breakthroughs

• Is proficient in Python and ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.




You’re an ENGINEER who:

• Writes code that outlasts the current project

• Thinks in systems, not just scripts

• Tests obsessively (A/B testing solutions, End-to-End testing softwares) and documents proactively

• Knows cloud infra like the back of your hand (AWS preferred)




Bonus points for experience with:

• Implementing CI/CD pipelines, MLOps practices, and infrastructure-as-code for robust and repeatable deployments

• Feature stores and real-time inference pipelines

• Open data formats like Delta Lake or Iceberg

• Swedish language skills (not required, but a plus)




What Apotea Offer You

The chance to work on cutting-edge AI and ML projects that impact millions of customers.
Join a flat, agile organization with minimal bureaucracy
Drive sustainability through eco-friendly packaging and logistics
Opportunities for career growth through training, mentorship, and industry conferences.
Collaborate in a cross-functional, transparent environment
Own projects from concept to deployment
A stable, future-focused company with a meaningful mission to improve healthcare accessibility.

Great coding skills
Skilled at both autonomous tasks and contributing to group efforts
Ability to examine details closely and critically




At Veo, you'll be part of a thriving work environment where every day brings new excitement. Our rapid growth ensures a diverse and ever-changing atmosphere. We believe in work-life balance and providing a positive culture that allows you to thrive personally and professionally.

Our Copenhagen office mirrors our innovative technology – with an indoor ball court, rooftop terrace, and well-equipped gym. We have created a facility that supports connecting disciplines across the business, facilitates creative thinking, and gives the space to engage with colleagues, our global partners, and the entire Veo community.

Diversity and differences are valuable assets for us. We value diversity and inclusion and welcome people from all backgrounds. If you’re excited about this role but your experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Values We Hold at Veo:

Dare - We take initiative, stay curious, and challenge the status quo in our work.

Own it - We drive impact by identifying opportunities, taking responsibility, and confidently executing.

Level up - We embrace growth, continuously learning and shaping our skills.

Play as a team - We collaborate across a diverse organization, leveraging shared insights for stronger outcomes.

Customer Centric - We deliver value by having close partnerships and a deep understanding of our customers (internally and externally)

We’re committed to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. And you may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Would you like to be part of a team focused on solving real-world business problems by transforming our approach to how we work with data and AI/machine learning at scale at Danske Bank?

With clear ties to our Forward ’28 Group Strategy, Group Data & Analytics is now creating the foundation for leveraging data and AI/ML capabilities. We are currently ramping up to build a highly specialised team that partners with our core business and development teams to deliver solutions that elevate data-driven decision-making and add value to our portfolio of existing and new IT applications.

To do so, we have recently established an AI & Data Science team that will empower the organisation to leverage data and AI technologies to deliver business value and benefits.

Not only do we want to build things right, but just as importantly, we want to build the right things—which, in the era of AI and all the hype that comes with it, can be a challenge. You will play a key role in striking that balance.

As part of our migration to AWS, you will also be involved in moving to our future Data Science platform to help accelerate the impact of machine learning across Danske Bank. This will happen in close collaboration with peers in other teams across the organisation. You will promote clear directions for standards, best practices, and ways of working with data science as formulated by our team.

Depending on your experience and knowledge, we may offer you different levels of seniority in the role.

Please be informed that interviews will be held in mid-August.

About you:


Hands-on experimentation and proof-of-value in our lab environment
Scope and deliver end-to-end AI solutions
Guide and educate data scientists and data engineers throughout our organisation in relation to both methods and platform/tooling
Cultivate strong relationships with data scientists and business experts across the organisation


You will:


Outcome-oriented with a focus on solving problems
Effective communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to bring the right stakeholders together
Curious about product development and technology trends, with a keen interest in knowledge and self-improvement
Strong in mathematics, statistics, and machine learning
Experience with the following or similar technologies: Python, Spark/PySpark, Airflow, SQL, Public cloud providers, particularly AWSD, databricks, FastAPI, MLflow, Monitoring frameworks (g., Prometheus, Grafana), Containerisation (g., Kubernetes, Docker, OpenShift), CI/CD, pipelines, Git/Azure DevOps
Upper-intermediate English skills
Experience with Design Thinking or a similar UX framework would be beneficial


“We believe that the most valuable asset is human potential.”

We offer:

This position can be located both in Lithuania and Denmark. If the position is located in Lithuania the monthly salary range will be from 2680 EUR to 4020 EUR gross (based on your competencies relevant for the job).

Additionally, each Danske Bank employee receives employee benefits package (benefits are only valid for Lithuania the same as the salary ranges) which includes:

Growth opportunities: professional & supportive team, e-learnings, numerous development programs; (incl. professional certificates); 100+ professions for internal mobility opportunities.


Health & Well-being: a diverse, inclusive, work & life balance work environment; additional health insurance; mental well-being practices; partial psychologist counselling compensation; silence and sleep zones at the office; game rooms.

Når nu vi beder dig om et CV, er det vist kun fair, at du også får vores.

Vi hedder Vertica, og vi er en højt specialiseret virksomhed inden for digital forretningsudvikling og ecommerce-løsninger. Vi har mere end 20 års erfaring, og vi har lige nu ansvaret for 150 verticanere fordelt på vores kontorer i hjertet af Aarhus og Kødbyen i København.

Vi har lavet prisvindende ecommerce-løsninger for nogle af de største og mest ambitiøse e-handelsvirksomheder i Danmark såsom Søstrene Grene, Brødrene Dahl, Hørkram og Louis Poulsen. Arbejde, der kræver bred faglig viden om alt fra teknisk forretningsudvikling, softwareudvikling og QA til projektledelse, UX og digitalt design.

Vi tror meget på vigtigheden af en god arbejdskultur, og vi er stolte af at have bygget en, der beror på faglig stolthed, videndeling, personlig udvikling og flere sociale arrangementer, end du nogensinde får tid til.

Så vi kan lidt af hvert, og vi synes, du skal vælge os.

Din nye hverdag

Som en del af vores AI og Data-team arbejder du sammen med et team af kolleger med forskellig baggrund og kompetencer. Det, der binder jer sammen, er jeres store interesse for data, AI og forretningsudvikling – og hvordan vi i Vertica kan hjælpe vores kunder med at omsætte data til vigtige indsigter, som kan være med til at flytte og styrke vores kunders forretning. I din rolle kommer du med det rette data på det rette tidspunkt og i den rette kvalitet. Du skaber således et stærkt fundament for, at vores kunder har nem adgang til at arbejde med data. Da vi er en konsulentvirksomhed, vil vores opgaver variere afhængigt af vores kunders behov. Dog kan vi fortælle, at vores fokus er at udvikle AI løsninger til ecommerce, hvor vi laver alt fra conversational agents til dynamisk prissætning.

Vi forestiller os, at du skal arbejde med følgende.



Designe, bygge og levere værdiskabende AI løsninger til en bred række af kunder i samarbejde med resten af AI og Data teamet 
Være med til at finde de bedste løsninger baseret på kundernes ønsker og behov
Udvikle og implementere robuste metoder til evaluering og overvågning, så vi sikrer høj kvalitet i vores løsninger.
Udvikle produktionsklar Python kode 
Bidrage til at definere best practices og standarder for data science i organisationen
Følge og arbejde på projekter fra start til slut samt endeligt at sætte løsningen i produktion



Dit fundament

Vi forestiller os, at du har minimum 3 års relevant erhvervserfaring samt har et solidt teknisk grundlag og evnerne og forståelsen for at drive processer fra start til slut. Men vigtigst af alt er, at du er passioneret omkring AI og har lyst til at drive vores forretning til nye højder sammen med resten af teamet.

Det er et plus, hvis du har erfaring med hele machine learning lifecycle eller har erfaring med at arbejde med forskellige dataplatforme.

Derudover lægger vi vægt på, at:



Du har erfaring som konsulent og motiveres af at arbejde med AI projekter samt hjælpe kunder med at finde den bedste løsning til deres udfordringer  
Du har erfaring med at sætte machine learning modeller eller AI løsninger i produktion   
Du har stærke færdigheder og god erfaring med Python 
Du har flair og interesse for at arbejde med en bred vifte af AI løsninger



Fik vi nævnt…

At vi ikke har nogen chefer. Her er der ingen, der bestemmer, hvordan du skal arbejde. Vi har sat beslutningerne fri, så dem der har faglighed og kompetence selv bestemmer, hvordan de løser opgaverne. Det betyder, at du og dit team får mulighed for at indrette jeres arbejde, sådan som I mener, det er bedst.   

At gennemsigtighed er en af kerneværdierne i Vertica, og derfor ligger vores personalehåndbog frit tilgængeligt online. I personalehåndbogen kan du læse, hvilke vilkår vi - og alle vores fremtidige kolleger - arbejder under. Hvis ikke du har tid til at læse hele håndbogen igennem, så har vi fremhævet nogle af dem, vi sætter særligt pris på.

At vi tror på livslang læring: Vi går i livets skole, men af og til er der også kurser, konferencer eller uddannelser, som man kan lære af. Er der noget, du gerne vil blive klogere på, har du muligheden for at videreuddanne dig i Vertica. Vi har intet loft på uddannelsesbudgettet, så der heller ikke er loft på læringen.

At vi er hamrende sociale: Vi holder af sociale arrangementer, og vi holder mange af dem. Det kan være alt fra klatring, padeltennis, byg-dit-eget-tastatur og cocktail-kursus til familietur i Djurs Sommerland. Derudover tager vi hvert år på en firmaweekend, hvor vi har fokus på hygge, god mad og socialt samvær.

At vi er hele mennesker på arbejde: Vi tror på at der er andet i livet end arbejde og derfor er det vigtigt for os, at vi holder os inden for en 37-timers arbejdsuge, og at vi behandler hinanden med stor ordentlighed og respekt

Har du erfaring med modellering, monitorering og deployment? Og vil du arbejde med landets mest interessante datagrundlag? Så er du den Data Scientist, vi søger til afdelingen Fraud Detection & AI Solutions.




Vil du fremtidssikre velfærdssamfundet med teknologier som ML, NLP og Computer Vision?




I ATP udvikler vi de it-løsninger, der får to ud af tre velfærdskroner ud til danskerne, og i Fraud Detection & AI Solutions bygger vi løsninger, der forebygger fejludbetalinger og snyd med offentlige ydelser.




Vi understøtter også effektivisering af forretningens processer ved hjælp af NLP, Computer Vision og OCR. Vi har kortlagt et stort NLP-potentiale på tværs af ATP, og nu arbejder vi på at udvikle og implementere løsningerne, så vi sikrer en effektiv udbetaling af velfærdsydelserne.




Lige nu søger vi en erfaren Data Scientist med teknisk profil, som har lyst til at arbejde med avancerede løsninger og samtidig gøre en konkret forskel.




Som vores nye Data Scientist er dine opgaver at:




arbejde tæt sammen med forretningen og kolleger med forskellige profiler for at forstå behov og omsætte dem til tekniske løsninger
udvikle og optimere modeller i Python, som ofte er baseret på Machine Learning
automatisere monitorering og sikre løbende forbedring af modelperformance
arbejde med velafprøvede principper fra softwareudvikling på analyseområder for at sikre, at vores løsninger bringes sikkert fra udvikling til produktion i vores scrum-setup
deltage aktivt i at udvikle og produktionslægge vores NLP-løsninger sammen med andre tekniske specialister.




Kan og vil du skabe resultater?




Vi forestiller os, at du har et par års erfaring som softwareudvikler eller Data Scientist, og at du:




har en relevant kandidatgrad inden for matematik, statistik, fysik, computer science, ingeniørvidenskab eller lignende
har erfaring med dataanalyse og udvikling af Machine Learning-modeller
kan arbejde i Python, SQL mv. (vil være en fordel)
trives i tværfagligt samarbejde og bidrager til et team, hvor vi lærer af hinanden
er god til at finde enkle løsninger på komplekse udfordringer.




Vil du arbejde med landets mest interessante datagrundlag?




Afdelingen Fraud Detection & AI Solutions er en del af enheden Data i ATP’s it-organisation. Her arbejder vi med data til gavn for fællesskabet og den enkelte dansker. Sagt med andre ord får vi data til at arbejde for os, så vi som samfund får mest mulig værdi ud af de data, vi som Danmarks største databank har til rådighed.




Du bliver en del af en afdeling med mere end 40 dygtige kolleger. Vi er Data Scientists, Software Developers, Data Analysts og forretningsansvarlige. Du kommer især til at arbejde tæt sammen med afdelingens dygtige tekniske specialister, som arbejder med data science og softwareudvikling i full stack-løsninger.




Vi arbejder i et højt fagligt miljø, hvor vi deler viden og hjælper hinanden med at udvikle os – både teknisk og personligt.




I afdelingen har vi ansvaret for at udvikle løsninger og værktøjer, der gør offentlige myndigheder i stand til at gennemføre koordinerede kontroller med en lang række velfærdsydelser.




Som central specialenhed har vi fokus på at forebygge og identificere fejludbetalinger, så de hurtigst muligt korrigeres og undgås i fremtiden. Derudover er vi i gang med flere effektiviseringsprojekter, hvor vi bl.a. anvender NLP og OCR.




=dig? Så send os dit CV




Send os dit CV hurtigst muligt, da vi behandler henvendelser løbende. Når du sender dit CV via vores system, får du mulighed for kort at beskrive din motivation for at søge stillingen.




I ATP arbejder vi for en fair rekrutteringsproces, og derfor beder vi dig om ikke at vedhæfte billede i dit CV eller angive din alder, når du søger.




Du kan læse mere om rekrutteringsforløbet her.




Vær opmærksom på, at vi inden ansættelse indhenter straffeattest, der ikke må give anledning til bemærkninger.




Har du spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte sektionschef Lene Blak Rasmussen på tlf. 40 12 89 21 eller mail lru@atp.dk.

AI is rapidly evolving and changing how we build, work, and think. So far we’ve been trailing behind a bit, but we are ready to catch up and figure out how best to utilize AI.

We are looking for an enthusiastic and skilled engineer to play a pivotal role in integrating artificial intelligence into both our daily work and our core product. This is an exciting opportunity to work across various departments, and help drive our AI initiatives forward.




🛠 What You’ll Be Doing

You’ll be our internal AI champion — researching, prototyping, and guiding us as we explore new ways to use modern AI tools.

 Here’s what your days might include:

Spotting AI opportunities in both our products and day-to-day workflows.
Building prototypes using tools like Claude, loveable, etc.
Automating repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and make work more enjoyable .
Testing new AI tools, exploring their limits, and recommending what to adopt.
Collaborating with teams such as product, engineering, and others to understand pain points and help find solutions (maybe using AI?).
Running small experiments, creating demos, and showcasing AI's potential to inspire others.




🙋 Who You Are

You are someone who loves to build things and have experience with modern AI tools. No-code, low-code, dev-focused assistance, all of it is relevant for us.

You are great at running with an idea and turning it into a prototype. Helping others see the value of AI assistance is your jam, and communicating complex information in a simple manner is something you excel at. Working with different departments and teams is a possibility to learn more and have a broader impact. 

Extra points if you:




Have experience working with C#.
Have previously worked in a SaaS company.
Know TypeScript /* or JS in general */
Have worked with product or design teams.




🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who We Are

At iPaper, we help retailers create better online shopping experiences. For years, we’ve been the go-to platform for turning static PDFs into interactive, shoppable catalogues. Now, with Horizon, we’re taking it further, transforming product feeds into scrollable, mobile-friendly catalogues designed for today’s digital-first shoppers.

We’re a company of 40 people across many nationalities, based in Aarhus. We’re friendly, down-to-earth, and a little nerdy (in the best way). We genuinely enjoy spending time together - whether it’s solving tricky bugs, celebrating a launch, or sharing cake in the kitchen.

Our office is built for both focus and fun - think foosball table, PlayStation, VR gear, rooftop terrace, spontaneous grill sessions, and plenty of other social events small and large 🔥

We’ve been around since 2006, so we’re stable and profitable, but we’ve kept part of that startup energy — agile, curious, and full of heart. You’ll be part of a company that cares deeply about the work and the people doing it.




🎁 What You’ll Get




Hybrid work setup (we love the office but flexibility is key).
Flexible hours and work-life-balance.
Time and budget for personal development.
High-spec gear and modern tools.
A fun, inclusive, and nerd-friendly team .
The opportunity to help shape how we work with AI from the ground up.

Want more details? Check out our public employee handbook: https://handbook.ipaper.io




✉️ How to Apply

 We’ve kept it simple. No resume. No cover letter.

 Just share your name, LinkedIn, and answer a few quick questions.




We’d love to hear from you.

We’re going AI-first, and we need someone who’s already built real things with AI agents and AI tooling. If you’ve used GPT, LangChain, Claude, or similar to automate processes, integrate APIs, or create production-grade AI flows, this is your stage.




Our mission: build the most advanced, intelligent product lifecycle management (PLM) platform for the fashion and lifestyle industry. Our customers are global brands and suppliers who use our platform to collaborate, manage collections, and streamline every stage from idea to finished product. We help them digitize workflows, optimize resources, and make better decisions, faster.




This isn’t a research role. This is about building AI-driven tools that work, ship fast, and deliver impact.




What You’ll Do

Build internal AI agents that automate everything from product data enrichment to supplier communication flows.
Use OpenAI (GPT-4o), LangChain, n8n, and custom .NET/React/Azure-based services to develop real, end-to-end solutions.
Translate domain knowledge (from product, customer success, and support teams) into prompt-based tools, scripts, and interfaces.
Develop backend logic in .NET and connect with our main platform via REST APIs, webhooks, and Azure services.
Collaborate directly with the founder, product team, and engineers to prioritize high-impact use cases.
Document and test your agents so they can scale across customers, countries, and product lines.
Optionally: build or connect frontend UIs in React or with low/no-code tools like Retool.




Who You Are

You have a Master’s degree or 3–5 years of relevant experience building software with AI agents or AI tooling, in production or through substantial real-world projects.
You’ve already built real things with AI – whether that’s agents, automations, prompt-driven workflows, or integrations between AI tools and APIs.
You’re comfortable with .NET/C#, React, REST APIs, and Azure-based databases/storage.
You’ve used tools like LangChain, GPT, Claude, Supabase, or n8n, and ideally connected them together into working systems.
You love shipping fast, learning fast, and solving real customer problems.
You think in systems. You see the flow between tools, prompts, users, and data.
Bonus: experience with product lifecycle management, supply chain, or fashion industry workflows.




Why Join Us

Work on real-world AI problems, not gimmicks.
Be part of a small, ambitious, and product-driven team with deep market traction.
Ship and own projects that get used by brands and suppliers worldwide.
Help define how AI is applied in one of the most operationally complex and underserved domains: product development and collaboration.
Enjoy full autonomy, fast feedback loops, and the ability to shape the product and stack.
Based in Copenhagen? Great. Prefer hybrid or remote (within CET ±2)? Also great.




Tech Stack You’ll Touch

GPT-4o / OpenAI Functions / Claude
LangChain / n8n
.NET / C# / React
Azure Functions, Azure Storage, Azure SQL
REST APIs (internal and customer)
Retool (optional)
Other tech stacks that can improve efficiency




Compensation

Competitive salary based on experience
Equity/warrants
Office in central Copenhagen with hybrid flexibility
Real ownership. No bureaucracy.




**OPEN TO EU RELOCATORS!**

We’ll help you succeed in a globally connected powerhouse of diverse teams and take your career wherever you want it to go.

Join EY and help to build a better working world.

About The Job

At the EY’s digital product organization, you will be building intelligent tax automation tools and agentic AI platforms for increased efficiency, quality, and joy in tax and compliance workflows.

We help thousands of clients with services such as producing correct and compliant tax filings, and consulting multinational companies on how to navigate the international tax landscape.

To do those jobs with the highest degree of accuracy and efficiency, intelligent automation and great AI-powered software play key roles.

We operate across the Nordics (DK, FI, SE, NO) with a small, flat, and informal organization of ~40 engineers, designers, researchers, and PMs. In a distributed setup across all countries where we work from home and offices depending on preferences and needs.

Tax? Yes, tax filings and tax law are the domains we design and build for, so having an interest in those areas would be good. Actual experience and domain knowledge is of course a plus, but certainly not a requirement. It's a pretty small Venn diagram of ML engineers who also have professional tax experience.

Above all, we value working with good all-round people. People who are both highly specialized but are capable of collaborating across disciplines.

About You

As an ML/AI engineer, you will be entrusted with building intelligent automation systems and agentic AI platforms across several business-critical tax products.

As a master of your craft, you will develop production-ready ML models, NLP pipelines, and AI agents using Python, Langchain, and modern transformer architectures.

Solutions that are well-tested, documented, optimized for performance, and easy to maintain.

You have honed those skills by working on ML applications in cross-functional product teams, where you have shown yourself as a wonderful collaborator who can translate business requirements into intelligent technical solutions.

You have likely also done many model reviews and taken initiative to question AI approaches suggested by people more senior in the company than yourself. And challenged product decisions that didn't make technical sense from an ML perspective.

If that sounds like you, we should talk. In the meantime, here's more information about the work and our team.

Your Key Responsibilities


Building intelligent tax automation systems using ML/AI technologies
Developing agentic AI platforms for Nordic tax regulations and compliance
Close collaboration with tax professionals, designers, product managers, and fellow engineers
Spending time, occasionally, with users and domain experts to understand tax workflows in detail
Working across a range of products and problem spaces in the tax domain
Freedom to work remotely or in our Copenhagen or Stockholm office


Skills And Attributes For Success

To qualify for the role, you should have:


ML/AI Fundamentals: Experience with supervised/unsupervised learning, classification, entity extraction, document processing, and time-series analysis
NLP Expertise: Proficiency with transformer models, embeddings, document analysis, and Named Entity Recognition
Python Stack: Strong experience with Langchain, Ragas, OpenAI API, and modern ML frameworks
Production Experience: 2+ years deploying ML models as REST APIs with async processing capabilities
Database Skills: Experience with MongoDB and vector databases, particularly for document and financial data modeling
Cloud Platforms: Familiarity with Azure AI Foundry or similar cloud ML platforms
Security Awareness: Understanding of data privacy, security requirements, and compliance frameworks (SOX, PCI)
Easy access to Copenhagen, Helsinki, or Stockholm. You can work remotely most of the time, but we meet up in person weekly
Really good English speaking and writing skills. That's our work language
An interest in tax law and financial regulations


What We Look For

We obviously want you to be a skilled ML engineer, but we believe that a engineer is so much more than that. We are looking for a colleague who is…


A real craftsperson and a stickler for technical details
Delightful to be around and able to communicate ML concepts to non-technical stakeholders
A clear communicator who can translate between tax domain experts and technical teams
Supportive and helpful in cross-functional collaboration
Quick to solve complex problems with practical engineering solutions
Questioning AI approaches and decisions before committing to implementation
Eager to learn about both advancing ML techniques and tax domain complexities
Comfortable working in 6-week Shape Up cycles with autonomous project ownership


What We Offer


A tech product team: Digital product organization as a unit operates mostly product- and user-driven, even though we are situated within a large consultancy organization
Direct access to domain experts: Your ML models will directly impact tax professionals who are quite literally right next to you, providing immediate feedback and domain insights
Cutting-edge AI challenges: Work on agentic AI platforms and intelligent automation in a regulated, high-stakes environment
Shape Up methodology: Work in focused 6-week cycles with clear scope and autonomy
Good food and good times: We take good care of the people who dedicate their working hours to our cause
Diverse and inclusive culture: You'll be embraced for who you are and empowered to use your voice to help others find theirs

CALL IT A PLAN

Som salgselev i YouSee tilrettelægger du dit arbejdsliv efter dit liv.

Har din sport en vigtig plads i dit liv, hepper vi på dig.

Spiller selvforkælelse en stor rolle i dit liv, får du råd til det hos os.

Og er det vigtigt for dig, at arbejdslivet er mindst lige så fedt som resten af dit liv, så skab din egen succes som YouSee’s nye salgselev.

HOLDÅND ER FUNDAMENTET

FOR VORES SUCCES

Som ny elev træder du direkte ind i vores butiksboble. Og du skal være med til at gøre den endnu bedre. Dine kompetencer og høje ambitioner får en markant rolle i at udvikle butikken og give kunderne en uovertruffen oplevelse, der gør, at de kommer igen og igen.

Udover at betjene og rådgive kunder bliver du bl.a. også inddraget i driftsopgaver, deltagelse på events og besvarelse af support-kald på telefonen.

Teamet i butikken bliver dit hold. I er som et professionelt sportsteam; I er passionerede for det I laver, og I fokuserer på individuel såvel som på fælles performance. I går målrettet efter at løfte jer selv og hinanden til nye højder. I foretrækker det går stærkt, og det skal være fedt imens!

Samtidig får du en leder i butikschefen, hvis vigtigste opgave er at skabe et miljø, hvor du og dine kollegaer har plads til succesfuldt at udvikle jer - både som individer og som team. Butikschefen har ofte selv startet karrieren som elev og vil med sin erfaring kunne coache og støtte dig på rejsen.

DU FÅR I GNS. +3.000 KR.

I PROVISION SOM SALGSELEV

Du påvirker selv din løn. I hvert fald den del, der udgør provisionen. Og der er ikke noget loft over den provision, du kan lægge ovenpå din grundløn hver måned.

Provisionen sikrer, at du bliver belønnet for dine præstationer – ikke kun på salget, men på massevis af områder.

Vil du have meget mere til luksus en måned? Sigt højt og gå målrettet efter at gøre en ekstraordinær indsats. Det betaler sig!

EKSKLUSIVT MEDLEM

I VORES PLUSCLUB

Du får fede fordele i lommen. Som elev i YouSee får du adgang til appen PlusClub. Her optjener du dagligt point. Point scores når du f.eks. sælger telefoner, abonnementer og tilbehør. Du kan derfor selv være med til at påvirke, hvor hurtigt dine point fordobler sig!

Pointene kan bruges på en lang række af de apps, du sikkert allerede bruger i forvejen: JustEat.dk, Miinto og Nordisk Film Biografer for bare at nævne nogle få.

KARRIERE MED

PLADS TIL LIVET

Du får plads til livet ved siden af arbejdet. Din butik bliver din base, og forhåbentlig kommer du til at elske at være i den. Men du har også et liv uden for den. Det ved vi. Og derfor tilbyder vi stor fleksibilitet i den måde, vi tilrettelægger dit arbejde på. Hvis du går til fodbold eller dans om onsdagen, tilpasser vi din vagtplan til det. Og hvis du skal til familiefødselsdag samtidig med en vagt, så hjælper holdet i butikken hinanden med at bytte vagter.

Arbejdet er ikke hele dit liv. Og dit arbejde hos YouSee skal ikke stå i vejen for resten af dit liv.

Hvad kræver det for at blive elev på Danmarks fedeste elevhold?

For at få direkte adgang til vores uddannelse skal du have en baggrund i EUD Detail, HHX eller EUX. Har du en STX, HF eller HTX, skal du blot supplere med et 5 ugers EUS-forløb. Derudover forventer vi, at du er motiveret, engageret og tager din uddannelse seriøst.

Hvordan bliver dit skoleforløb?

Du er på skoleophold 10 gange af en uges varighed i løbet af de to år, uddannelsen varer, og her tager alle cases udgangspunkt i YouSee’s egen forretning - og ofte også fra den butik, du selv er elev i. Det giver dig mulighed for at omsætte det, du lærer i skolen, direkte i din hverdag i butikken.

På skolen træner du salg, præsentationsteknik, økonomi og markedsføring, så du bliver dygtig til at levere verdens bedste kundeoplevelse. Du vil derfor også opleve, at du hurtigt bidrager til dit team og i butikken.

Send din ansøgning i dag – vi glæder os til at lære dig at kende!

Strong analytical skills, a focus on quality and detail, and a proven ability to solve problems in a structured way.
Preferably some experience with DevOps practices such as CI/CD, IaC, and test automation.
A positive, team-oriented mindset and a hunger for learning new technologies.
Excellent communication skills and an ability to express yourself clearly and concisely, both orally and in writing.




Even if you do not see yourself in all the bullets above, we still encourage you to apply if you believe your skills can make an impact on our team.




What we can offer you

We highly appreciate the variation in knowledge, experience, and perspectives our consultants bring to the table. In exchange, we make sure that you develop professionally and are supported and encouraged to meet your career goals—for example, we offer our consultants:

Enrolment in the Consultant Academy, which is our training program for building the essential Consultant skills. The Academy takes you to exciting locations to learn from leading professionals in their respective fields.
Focused career development by assigning you a talent manager who acts as your mentor and guides you in your professional journey at Deloitte.
Continuous learning opportunities within Software Engineering, Cloud, and Agile Ways of Working, for example, through certification courses.
The opportunity to participate in projects and internal work with our different market offerings to find the right fit for you.

We serve a range of carbon-emitting industries including cement, blue hydrogen, bio/waste-to-energy, and gas-to-power among others. Through our portfolio of projects, we are mitigating the environmental cost of industrial activity for a cleaner, more sustainable future. We see a daily growth in our market potential as a rising number of customers look to carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) and our company to solve their emissions challenges.

SLB Capturi is one of the leading companies globally that has extensive knowledge of the entire CCUS value chain. We have many ongoing projects, from research and innovation, including pilot plant testing, to concept studies and to large EPC projects, both in Europe and in the United States. Today, we are delivering seven carbon capture units in Europe, with an accumulated capture capacity of 1 million tonnes of CO2. In Denmark, we are delivering five Just Catch 100 units to Ørsted, in the Netherlands one Just Catch 100 unit to Twence, and in Norway a Big Catch to Heidelberg Materials.

Are you ready to work with us to realise the potential CCUS has in making a lasting, positive impact on our environment?

As SLB Capturi's Technology Development Manager, you will be at the forefront of shaping the next generation of carbon capture solutions.

You will lead high-impact R&D programs and technology qualification projects, ensuring our most important technology initiatives move from concepts to real-world applications.

This is a role for someone who thrives at the intersection of deep technical expertise and strategic and innovative thinking.

You will combine a strong foundation in process systems and chemical engineering with the ability to align complex projects to business objectives.

Experience with carbon capture processes is a plus, but your ability to see the bigger picture, connect the dots, and drive innovation across multiple stakeholders is what will set you apart.

Expect to work closely with senior technical leaders, subject matter experts, and external research partners, influencing the direction of our technology for years to come.

Responsibilities:


Initiate and lead R&D projects on carbon capture technology
Plan and execute large-scale technology qualification programs
Contribute to the development of the technology strategy and roadmap for carbon capture
Maintain a holistic overview of all ongoing R&D and technology qualification activities to ensure alignment and efficiency
Drive progress in R&D and technology qualification
Manage budgets and schedules for all assigned R&D and technology qualification activities


Requirements


Master's or PhD in Chemical, Process, or Mechanical Engineering, or equivalent experience.
Proven experience leading R&D programs and technology qualification projects in process industries
Knowledge of carbon capture processes is a plus
Strong technical understanding of process systems and ability to connect technology with business impact
Hands-on experience with technology qualification, validation, or demonstration activities


Personal attributes:


Excellent coordination, communication, and stakeholder management skills
Strategic mindset with the ability to maintain a holistic view across multiple programs
Proactive, results-driven, and comfortable making decisions in complex environments


This Is What We Offer

Not just a job, but a career you can take an active role in the industrial energy transition. We believe carbon capture is essential to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. We value the feeling of belonging, and this role will be crucial in supporting SLB Capturi to help the industry meet its carbon capture obligations. As our colleague, you will be given opportunities and responsibility to develop with our company. We can offer a dynamic and challenging environment in a growing ESG company.

And no powerful AI without a developer experience that just works.

Doctors and nurses are facing immense pressure: growing administrative burdens, tighter resources, and the risk of burnout. They deserve tools that restore their focus on care, not paperwork. Corti began by building the world’s leading AI assistant for healthcare, supporting clinicians in real time by listening, documenting, prompting, and safeguarding critical conversations.

Now, we’re opening up that intelligence through our API platform—enabling developers, partners, and providers to build with Corti’s AI in their own tools and workflows. From ambient scribing to clinical decision support, our infrastructure is unlocking new ways to scale healthcare excellence.

Entire health systems trust Corti. Millions of patient interactions have already been improved by our AI. With your help, we’ll reach millions more.

ZOE is the science and nutrition company leading a movement to transform the health of millions.

We exist because the food we eat is making us sick. Most of what we are taught about food is wrong.

ZOE runs the world’s largest nutrition science study to find scientifically proven solutions.

Our randomised controlled trial of ZOE proves that if you eat the right food for your body, you can feel healthier in weeks and be on track for more healthy years.

ZOE can change the way you eat, feel, and live. We host world-leading scientists on our podcast and bring proven science to your plate with Daily30+, our 30+ plant supplement.

Over 100,000 people rely on ZOE Membership, our personalised nutrition program, to make smarter food choices. ZOE Membership turns complex science into clear step-by-step actions, helping you improve your health with every meal.

ZOE means life — and you can change your life with food.

Visit our career page and become a ZOEntist 🚀

🚀 The Role

As a Data Scientist at ZOE, you will partner with world-class nutrition scientists to turn cutting-edge research into robust scoring algorithms and science-driven features, and to build ML/AI models that leverage our extensive members’ data to improve user experience and health outcomes.

This role is perfect for someone passionate about nutrition, health tech, or biology, or someone with the curiosity and drive to dive in and learn quickly.

Unlike a classical “fit-the-model” data science role, you’ll also engineer bespoke models that embed expert knowledge, validate them rigorously on real-world data, and ship production-ready code that powers the ZOE experience. You’ll collaborate daily with scientists, engineers, and product teams—moving fast and iterating quickly based on strong but not perfect evidence (:70 %) because speed beats perfection in a startup.

👥 The Team

You’ll be joining the Data Science team at Zoe. The team spends most of its time embedded in stream-aligned product teams while regularly setting aside a smaller portion of its schedule to drive high-impact, cross-cutting data science initiatives for the wider organisation.

Your home base will be the Scoring team—a cross-functional team of product managers, engineers, scientists, and data scientists that sits at the nexus of research and product. You’ll join a squad that prizes intellectual honesty, rapid experimentation, and our #ActFast ethos—working hand-in-hand with PhD scientists to turn hypotheses into deployed models.

🎯 What You’ll Be Doing


Design, iterate, and deploy scoring algorithms for foods, diets, metabolic responses, and microbiome profiles.
Translate expert food statements (e.g., ‘High-glycaemic foods raise blood glucose responses’) into model features and Python functions.
Build, test, and maintain clean, production-ready code in Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), and SQL/DBT/BigQuery/Airflow.
Build ML/AI models to improve food coverage and categorisation, ingredients extraction, food recommendations, and more.
Design validation frameworks that blend scientific rigour (e.g., hold-out tests, bootstrapping, sensitivity analyses) with pragmatic speed.
Partner with engineers to shape data contracts and ensure pipelines deliver the granularity, latency, and quality your models require.
Present results using decks, dashboards, or Looms to support data-driven product decisions.
Take full ownership of your work, brining entrepreneurial spirit and work proactively.
Champion our scientific yet agile approach: start with a hypothesis, seek evidence, and iterate fast.



🧠 What You’ll Bring To The Table


3+ years of professional experience in data science, ML engineering, or quantitative research.
A degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Applied Maths, Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Statistics, Computer Science).
Solid grasp of machine learning (e.g. training and evaluating standard models) and statistical techniques (e.g. running hypothesis testing).
Experienced in contributing to production-level Python codebases, developing new components and features, writing moderately complex SQL queries, and using Git for version control.
Experience turning domain knowledge (rules, heuristics, scientific findings) into engineered model logic.
A track record of shipping production code and collaborating in cross-functional, fast-paced environments.
Comfort using AI tools to enhance day-to-day productivity—from IDEs with AI assistants to prompt engineering.
Strong communication and collaboration skills—from delivering clear presentations to stakeholders to conducting deep-dive code reviews and working collaboratively across functions.
Must have a passion for nutrition, health tech, biology, or a strong desire to dive in and learn quickly.
A commitment to our #ActFast value: optimise for reversible decisions, take smart risks, and move quickly with imperfect data.



🌟 Bonus Points


Experience with causal inference and advanced statistical modelling.
Experience with building AI features using LLMs and evaluation frameworks.
Exposure to MLOps best practices.
Knowledge of microbiome data, ---omics pipelines, or biomarker analytics.



✨ Our Hiring Journey


👋 Stage 1: Talent Screening Interview – 30 mins – With Laia, Talent Acquisition Manager

You’ll meet team members from other disciplines (like product, engineering, or nutrition science). We want to see how you collaborate across teams and communicate complex ideas in a clear, accessible way.

Leadership & Behavioural Interview –45 mins

A behavioural-style interview focusing on how you lead projects (with or without a formal title), work under pressure, handle ambiguity, and contribute to team culture. We'll also take time to answer any remaining questions you have.


🎉 Offer



If everything clicks, we’ll move to offer quickly and transparently. You'll always know where you stand and what comes next.

The experience, skills, and attributes listed above reflect what we believe will contribute to success in this role. If you're passionate about ZOE and the opportunity, but don't meet 100% of the criteria, we still encourage you to apply. We are committed to supporting growth and are happy to offer up-skilling opportunities where possible.

Remote Philosophy

ZOE is a remote-first company, meaning remote work isn’t just an option — it’s how we work best. We are intentional about building a distributed, high-performing team where collaboration, trust, and flexibility thrive.

We design our workflows around asynchronous communication and shared documentation to support autonomy, focus, and cross-timezone collaboration. While our teams work independently, connection and teamwork remain central to how we operate — through regular rituals, meaningful virtual interactions, and in-person gatherings every quarter. These include team offsites and a yearly company-wide retreat to build relationships, spark creativity, and have fun together.

Being remote-first also means we value outcomes over hours and trust our team members to manage their work in a way that suits their unique rhythm and responsibilities. This approach allows us to support a truly flexible work environment, while staying aligned with our mission and values.

At ZOE, working remotely doesn’t mean working alone — it means being empowered, supported, and connected, wherever you are.

Compensation Philosophy

We are committed to offering competitive and equitable compensation that reflects the value of each role and aligns with regional labor market standards. Our approach to compensation goes beyond just base salary — we offer a comprehensive package that includes base pay and stock options, ensuring that every team member is rewarded for their contributions to the company’s growth and success.

We believe that building a thriving team requires not only providing fair and competitive compensation but also fostering an environment where success is shared collectively. Our total compensation package is designed to support the well-being of our employees, recognise their individual contributions, and empower them to grow alongside ZOE.

Benefits & Perks

We understand the significant role our benefits play in motivating, inspiring and safeguarding our employees' well-being. Our benefits strategy is thoughtfully designed to echo our mission and values, recognising the diverse needs arising from different life stages of our ZOEntists.

Our approach to benefits takes an inclusive and flexible view of both personal and professional growth. From competitive health insurance and wellness packages to inclusive parental policies, building connection, and tailored professional development programs, we've got you covered.

At ZOE, we continue to build a benefits package that invests in our team members’ long-term personal and professional growth and wellbeing, adding to this list as it evolves.

Equal opportunities

We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive team where every individual can bring their authentic self to work. We believe that this is key to our success and are dedicated to positively impacting the tech industry. As part of our commitment to equal opportunities, we encourage candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to apply. We ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all and do not discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, marital status, disability, or age. If you require any accommodations during the interview process, please feel free to inform us, and we will make every effort to support your needs.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Navys




At Navys, we are building the most advanced funds lawyer, ever.




Navys is transforming the fund formation process by combining deep legal expertise with AI. This isn’t another contract review or document summarizer: we are creating the Legal Operating System for funds.




Navys fuses internal legal precision and external regulatory insight into a living system that learns, reasons, and scales with fund professionals.




We are seeking an ambitious Data Scientist to join our team on a full-time basis. This is a unique chance to work alongside experienced private funds lawyers, AI engineers, and innovators in a tech-forward environment. Navys is not just a better tool - it’s a different model of how legal software should be built. You’ll be working on a product that completely reshapes the legal industry.




As our first or one of our first data science hires, you’ll play a foundational role in building AI-driven legal intelligence systems, from data ingestion and modelling through to experimentation and deployment. You’ll work closely with engineering, product, and legal teams to design models and pipelines that power our platform.




What you’ll own (first 12 months)




Design, train, and evaluate machine learning models for legal and regulatory intelligence.
Build robust data pipelines for ingesting, cleaning, and structuring complex legal data.
Collaborate with software engineers to integrate models into production systems.
Partner with legal experts to translate domain knowledge into data features and model architectures.
Develop and maintain model monitoring, evaluation, and retraining workflows.
Contribute to the design of our AI/ML stack and establish best practices for data science across the company.




Must-have technical foundations




Strong proficiency in Python for data science and machine learning.
Experience with NLP, large language models, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Proven track record of building and deploying ML models into production.
Solid understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics.
Familiarity with cloud-based ML services (Azure preferred; AWS acceptable).
Experience working with APIs, databases, and structured/unstructured datasets.
Excellent problem-solving, analytical, and communication skills.
Desire to work in a fast-paced, dynamic start-up environment and a go-getter attitude.




Nice-to-have extras




Experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
Knowledge of Azure AI services (e.g., Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Search).
Background in legal tech, fintech, or another highly regulated domain.
Familiarity with MLOps tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases, Kubeflow).
Understanding of vector databases and semantic search.
Experience with data visualisation libraries (e.g., Plotly, D3.js).






You’ll thrive here if




You are talented, focused, and aligned with our mission - we are building a complex product with innovative technology, so we need driven and dynamic candidates who can rise to the challenge.
You take ownership of problems and run with them—figuring things out with limited direction when needed.
You are a strong communicator who gets your point across clearly, and you’re not afraid to speak up when something needs addressing.
You are independent, flexible, and prepared to take on responsibility early on.
You are prepared to be accountable for—and proud of—the work you do and your contributions to the team.




What we offer




Work with a veteran team of ex-employees of leading law firms, tech companies, and AI labs.
Direct mentorship from senior engineers, private funds lawyers, and product leaders.
5% pension contribution.
25 days holiday.
Private healthcare.
Cycle2Work and Electric Car Schemes.
Participation in the company’s employee share options scheme (subject to tenure and performance).
Health, fitness, and gift card discounts.
Annual Team Trip – 2026 is skiing in the Swiss Alps.
A rare opportunity to design the AI models and data strategy of a transformative legal platform from day one.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.

We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed.

We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.

You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.

What You'll Do


Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business


What You'll Need


Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives


It would be great if you had


Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in...

How you’ll help us achieve it 

Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users. And, we’re still in the early days of our product roadmap and potential impact on people’s everyday lives.

We’re looking for an experienced Data Scientist and help grow and strengthen our user base. You’ll work on high-impact use cases with millions of users, such as optimizing our existing scratch card rewards program or designing and launching entirely new initiatives from scratch.

The technical challenges range from crafting simple heuristics when data is sparse to applying advanced techniques like geospatial analytics, network analysis, and uplift modeling. You’ll own the full cycle: defining the right approach, implementing it, and shipping it in production.

This role is highly experimentation-driven: you’ll be able to rapidly test ideas, learn from real user feedback, and iterate quickly.

We’re looking for someone who is product-minded, hands-on, and pragmatic: a data scientist who sees beyond models and algorithms and thinks deeply about how data connects to intuitive user behavior and real-world impact.

In this role you’ll:

Be part of a multidisciplinary team, working with engineers, data analysts, economists and a product manager.
Focus on advanced analytics and machine learning problems, delivering them end-to-end independently.
Prioritise work and shape your own approach in a way that maximises the positive impact on both users and the business.
Engage not just with business metrics, but also collaborate closely with Operations teams to understand the real-world outcomes and impact of your work.
Key Details
You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC -5 and +2) with reliable Internet access.
Wave covers travel once per year to one of our operating countries in Africa, as well as a yearly stipend of $1,200 to meet with coworkers.
Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level and location, we offer a salary of up to $149,200 USD (paid in your local currency equivalent), plus a generous equity package. 
Major benefits:
Subsidized health insurance for you and your dependents and retirement contributions (both vary from country to country).
6 months of fully paid parental leave and subsidized fertility assistance.
Flexible vacation, with most folks taking between 21-30 days exclusive of statutory holidays.
$10,000 annual charitable donation matching.
Requirements
Education and Experience
Minimum Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Engineering, or a related discipline. A Master's or PhD is a plus.  
4+ years experience in applied data science or similar experience.
Demonstrated experience with data analysis, machine learning and product A/B tests.
Experience in using advanced analytics for optimising targeting, rewards or incentive programs is a big plus.
Technical skills
Proficiency in applying machine learning methods to solve business problems.
Very strong Python skills with expertise in data manipulation, analysis and machine learning. Must be comfortable writing code that runs in production.
Competent in SQL.
Solid foundation in probability and statistics.
You might be a good fit if you 

Thrive on spotting key problems and finding the fastest, most effective solutions.

Enjoy and excel at working on machine learning and statistics problems.

Quickly build and validate proof-of-concept solutions, refining based on real-world feedback.

          Our mission<p>We're making Africa the first cashless continent.</p><p>In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.</p><p>We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.</p><p>Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in...</p> <strong>How you’ll help us achieve it&nbsp;</strong><p>Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users. And, we’re still in the early days of our product roadmap and potential impact on people’s everyday lives.</p><p>We’re looking for an experienced Data Scientist and help grow and strengthen our user base. You’ll work on high-impact use cases with millions of users, such as optimizing our existing scratch card rewards program or designing and launching entirely new initiatives from scratch.</p><p>The technical challenges range from crafting simple heuristics when data is sparse to applying advanced techniques like geospatial analytics, network analysis, and uplift modeling. You’ll own the full cycle: defining the right approach, implementing it, and shipping it in production.</p><p>This role is highly experimentation-driven: you’ll be able to rapidly test ideas, learn from real user feedback, and iterate quickly.</p><p>We’re looking for someone who is product-minded, hands-on, and pragmatic: a data scientist who sees beyond models and algorithms and thinks deeply about how data connects to intuitive user behavior and real-world impact.</p><p>In this role you’ll:</p><ul><li>Be part of a multidisciplinary team, working with engineers, data analysts, economists and a product manager.</li><li>Focus on advanced analytics and machine learning problems, delivering them end-to-end independently.</li><li>Prioritise work and shape your own approach in a way that maximises the positive impact on both users and the business.</li><li>Engage not just with business metrics, but also collaborate closely with Operations teams to understand the real-world outcomes and impact of your work.</li></ul><strong>Key Details</strong><ul><li>You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC -5 and +2) with reliable Internet access.</li><li>Wave covers travel once per year to one of our operating countries in Africa, as well as a yearly stipend of $1,200 to meet with coworkers.</li><li>Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level and location, we offer a salary of up to $149,200 USD (paid in your local currency equivalent), plus a generous equity package.&nbsp;</li><li>Major benefits:</li><ul><li>Subsidized health insurance for you and your dependents and retirement contributions (both vary from country to country).</li><li>6 months of fully paid parental leave and subsidized fertility assistance.</li><li>Flexible vacation, with most folks taking between 21-30 days exclusive of statutory holidays.</li><li>$10,000 annual charitable donation matching.</li></ul></ul><strong>Requirements</strong><ul><li>Education and Experience</li><ul><li>Minimum Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Engineering, or a related discipline.

At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive. Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.


About the team

We don't build pricing models, we build the driving intelligence that feeds them. Our mission is to drive safer roads and fairer insurance through data.

The Telematics team transforms raw phone sensor data into meaningful insights about how people drive. Using advanced signal processing and machine learning, we process high-frequency data to extract behavioural signals that power our understanding of driving quality, context, and risk.


About the Role

As a Senior Data Scientist, you'll help define the future of behaviour-based insurance. You'll own the development of features and algorithms that detect driving patterns from sensors, test new hypotheses, and bring the most impactful insights into production.

You'll work at the intersection of data science and engineering, generating scalable, real-world insights from GPS, accelerometer, and other data


What you will be doing

Design and build robust behavioural features and factors from telematics data

Develop end-to-end pipelines in Python and SQL, from quick heuristics to full ML models

Prioritise simple, robust solutions that scale, whether rule-based or ML-driven

Collaborate with Software Engineers and Product Managers to deploy features and validate impact

Lead experiments, explore new ideas, and automate insight generation

Translate complex sensor data into clear findings for internal use and product development


About You

MSc or equivalent industry experience in a relevant field (e.g. Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Statistics). Candidates with a BSc and strong production experience will also be considered

Experience delivering data science or data engineering solutions into production. You're comfortable writing production-grade code, not just notebooks

Strong Python and SQL skills, including the basic libraries (Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn). You value writing clean, maintainable, and tested code

Proven ability to design, build, and maintain data pipelines and tools from scratch that are reliable, maintainable, and scalable

Strong communicator{​{:}} able to translate ambiguous problems into structured, testable ideas and share insights across technical and non-technical team

It’s leadership, but not in the endless-meeting, big-team sense. It’s about leading your own projects, driving outcomes, and being accountable for real commercial impact.




Location: Nottingham (4 days per week in office)

Salary: £55,000 - £65,000 (DOE)

Client: High-growth Fintech




Why This Role Matters




Your work will shape how the business operates. To give you an example, one of your future teammates has already transformed the collections function by building models that determine who to call, when to call, and when to send comms - driving a step change in efficiency and results.




Now it’s your turn. You’ll work with senior stakeholders, dig into business pain points, pitch smart solutions, and deliver predictive models that directly influence decisions across the company.




What We’re Looking For




Proven impact - you’ve taken models into production and seen them deliver real results.
Autonomous leadership - confident owning projects, engaging stakeholders, and holding yourself accountable.
Technical credibility - strong hands-on data science capability (R, Python, or similar). What matters is outcomes, not syntax.
Commercial mindset - able to translate technical solutions into business impact, spotting opportunities others might miss.
Energy & curiosity - proactive, problem-seeking, and solutions-focused.




The Tech (Flexible)




Current stack: R, Databricks, SQL
Open to Python and other modern tools - what matters is results.




What You’ll Get




£55k–£65k salary (with some flex for the right person)
High visibility and autonomy - your work won’t be buried in layers of hierarchy
A direct line to senior leadership and real influence over business decisions
The chance to work with sharp, passionate people solving real-world problems with data




This role is four days a week in the Nottingham office. No hiding behind Zoom - you’ll be embedded in the business, collaborating face-to-face, and influencing directly.




If that’s a fit for you, this could be a career-defining move!




How to Apply




If you’re a Data Scientist who wants to own projects, deliver real outcomes, and be recognised for your impact, we’d love to hear from you.

An exciting opportunity has arisen for two Research Assistants (RAs) within the Institute of Mental Health. The RAs will be working on the ESRC/NIHR funded DETERMIND programme ( www.determind.org.uk ). DETERMIND is the largest cohort of newly diagnosed people with dementia and their carers currently running within the UK.

Following the success of the first wave, the programme has received further funding to recruit two supplementary ‘Seldom Heard Voices’ cohorts. Working alongside teams in Sussex, London and Gateshead, the RAs will be responsible for supporting the recruitment of 300 newly diagnosed people with dementia from Black, South Asian, Caribbean and other minority groups as well as 150 people with dementia who identify as LGBTQ+. In addition to this, the RAs will undertake face-to-face interviews with participants to deliver measures concerning people’s experiences of the diagnostic process, their access to services and their general well-being and life quality.

The positions are ideal for people considering a PhD or Clinical Doctorate, and many of our previous RAs have gone on to undertake these roles.

The post holders will be based at Nottingham University and hold Honorary contracts with Nottinghamshire NHS Foundation Trust. They will work as part of an established and diverse wider research team based at other recruitment sites in Sussex, London and Gateshead.

You must have knowledge and experience of working with people with dementia or other potentially vulnerable populations and the challenges that this may entail. You will have an understanding of research and delivering questionnaires to participants. You will have a desire and the personal capabilities to work with people with dementia to support their well-being and quality of life.

The University of Nottingham provides generous employment packages whilst supporting the well-being of our staff to help them reach their full potential. As a university employee, you will have an excellent choice of benefits and rewards, including:


A friendly, diverse, and supportive working environment
A hybrid working arrangement with the blended approach of home and office working each week
Generous holiday entitlement of 27 (30) days (or pro rata) plus standard bank holidays and five university closure days including closure between Christmas and New Year.
Our reward scheme grants bonuses of numerous values for excellent work
