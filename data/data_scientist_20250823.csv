Analyze training and evaluation datasets to identify distributional gaps, labeling inconsistencies, and long-tail opportunities.
Design and execute labeling campaigns, including development of golden datasets and annotation guidelines.
Build and maintain dashboards that track model accuracy, regression trends, and product-specific KPIs like success rate or answer helpfulness.
Investigate failure modes via prompt clustering, error taxonomy development, and user intent classification.
Operationalize feedback loops: mine product telemetry and human-in-the-loop reviews for signal, then translate into data-driven model improvement strategies.
Partner with engineers and PMs to run structured A/B tests and human evaluations for new models or features.
Support the development of scalable data and evaluation infrastructure for LLMs and agents.
Work with product, engineering and legal to create clear & transparent processes for the handling of customer data in AI training, fine-tuning and evaluation


About You

1–3 years of experience in applied ML or data science, preferably in NLP or LLM-based applications.
Strong SQL and Python skills; experience with Jupyter, Pandas, and experiment tracking tools.
Comfortable navigating ambiguity, slicing large datasets, and communicating insights clearly to cross-functional stakeholders.
Experience with prompt analysis, clustering, or user behavior modeling is a plus.
Bonus: familiarity with LLM eval techniques, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or agentic system design.Experience with program management.


Why This Role Matters

AI is critical to the value Ironclad customers get from their contracts, allowing their business to manage risk, close revenue faster and operate more effectively. None of this is possible without reliable and accurate data. This role will lead these efforts, becoming a key contributor to the development of AI solutions in an industry that is likely to be transformed by the new generation of models.

What We Value


Bias for action and data curiosity
Ownership mindset and team-first attitude
Comfort in fast-paced, iterative environments
Passion for building AI products that solve real-world customer problems

Uber's newly formed AI Security team, part of the Core Security Engineering organization, is building the foundation for dynamic, data-driven security systems. We're evolving Uber's Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to be more risk-adaptive across authentication and authorization, moving beyond static rules and manual approvals toward real-time, ML-driven access decisions that secure both humans and AI agents without slowing them down.

As a Senior ML Engineer, you'll translate ambiguous business and security needs into concrete ML problems, design and iterate on solutions, and take them end-to-end into production. This is greenfield work at the intersection of ML, security, and infrastructure, shaping how Uber secures AI at scale.

Basic Qualifications


5+ years experience building and deploying ML models in production, with hands-on work in feature engineering, training, and evaluation.
Proficiency across a broad range of ML algorithms: tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM), classical statistical models (logistic regression, SVMs), and deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers), with the ability to select and apply the right approach based on context and data.
Hands-on experience with feature engineering, model development, and productionization of ML pipelines.
Proficiency in PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar ML frameworks, and in Python or comparable languages for scalable, production-grade systems.


Preferred Qualifications


Proven ability to own ML systems end-to-end: from requirement discovery → feature design → modeling → deployment.
Deep experience with advanced ML techniques, including ensemble methods, neural networks, graph-based models, and handling challenges like imbalanced data, feedback loops, and iterative retraining.
Familiarity with large-scale data/infra systems (Kafka, Pinot, Hive, Cassandra, Spark, Flink).
Background in access control, authentication, or enterprise security systems.
Track record of technical leadership: mentoring engineers, driving cross-functional initiatives, or shaping ML/security strategy.


What The Candidate Will Do


Translate business and security needs into well-defined ML problems.
Develop, iterate, and productionize ML models that drive risk-adaptive decisions in real-time.
Engineer features from Uber's risk systems, logs, and contextual signals.
Integrate ML systems into Uber's critical access pathways (containers, APIs, gateways, data).
Collaborate across Security, Risk, and Infra teams to deliver scalable, production-ready solutions.
Provide leadership by mentoring junior engineers, evangelize ML best practices, and help shape ML strategy within AI Security.

Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, analyzing user behavior on a feature to identify areas of improvement, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data analysis, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

In your first year you will deliver analyses and experiments that improve core product metrics—match quality, time-to-hire, candidate experience, and revenue. You will:


Define north-star and feature-level metrics for our ranking, interview analytics, and payouts systems.
Design and run A/B tests and quasi-experiments; translate results into product decisions within the same week.
Develop source-of-truth dashboards and concise data models to enable teams to self-serve answers.
Collaborate with engineers to instrument events and improve data quality and processing latency from ingestion to insight.
Prototype lightweight models (from baseline methods to gradient-boosted trees) to improve matching and scoring.
Contribute to the evaluation of LLM-powered agents by designing evaluation rubrics, human-in-the-loop studies, and guardrail canaries.


You will thrive here if

You have solid fundamentals in statistics, SQL, and Python, and maintain projects you are prepared to demonstrate. You iterate quickly—frame the question, test, and implement solutions within days—and place as much value on clear communication as on statistical rigor. Familiarity with LLM evaluation, retrieval, and ranking is a plus; you will have the opportunity to learn alongside colleagues with experience at Jane Street, Citadel, Databricks, and Stripe.

Qualifications


0–2 years in data science/analytics or a similar role; BS/BA in a quantitative field (or equivalent practical experience).
Strong SQL skills and Python for analysis; comfortable with experiment design and causal thinking.
Communicates clearly and concisely with engineers, product managers, and leadership; translates analysis into actionable recommendations.
Nice-to-haves: dbt, dashboarding (Hex/Mode/Looker), marketplace or search/recommendation metrics, LLM/agent evaluation.

We are training large-scale models that predict on-the-job performance more accurately than any human interview. Our platform already powers hiring at top AI labs, and we scaled from $1M to $100M ARR in 11 months—making us the fastest-growing AI startup on record.

What You’ll Do

In your first year you’ll ship analyses and experiments that move core product metrics—match quality, time-to-hire, candidate experience, and revenue. You’ll:


Define north-star and feature-level metrics for our ranking, interview analytics, and payouts systems.
Design/run A/B tests and quasi-experiments; turn results into product decisions the same week.
Build source-of-truth dashboards and lightweight data models so teams can self-serve answers.
Instrument events with engineers; improve data quality and latency from ingestion to insight.
Prototype quick models (from baselines to gradient boosting) to improve matching and scoring.
Help evaluate LLM-powered agents: design rubrics, human-in-the-loop studies, and guardrail canaries.


You’ll thrive here if

You have solid fundamentals (statistics, SQL, Python) and projects you’re proud to demo. You iterate fast—frame the question, test, and ship in days—and care as much about clarity of communication as you do about p-values. Curiosity about LLM evaluation, retrieval, and ranking is a bonus; you’ll learn alongside folks who’ve shipped at Jane Street, Citadel, Databricks, and Stripe.

Qualifications


0–2 years in data science/analytics or similar; BS/BA in a quantitative field (or equivalent work).
Strong SQL; Python for analysis; comfort with experiment design and causal thinking.
Communicates crisply with engineers, PMs, and leadership; turns analysis into action.
Nice-to-haves: dbt, dashboarding (Hex/Mode/Looker), marketplace or search/recommendation metrics, LLM/agent evaluation.


Perks


Generous liquid equity compensation
$20K relocation bonus
$10K housing bonus
$1K/month food stipend
Free Equinox membership
Health insurance


We consider all qualified applicants without regard to legally protected characteristics and provide reasonable accommodations upon request.

Fay is a 3-sided AI platform redefining preventative care with a b2b2c business in a box. We're one of the fastest growing companies in tech and the fastest growing company in wellness history. We combine clinical expertise with smart systems. The result? More affordable, effective care for the people who need it most.

Behind the platform is a Marvel team of builders deeply connected to the problem we're solving. We pride ourselves on attracting superstar talent — the kind that's driven the best growth-to-burn metrics since early Airbnb, Stripe, and WhatsApp. Those aren't our words, though. That's straight from our investors at General Catalyst, Forerunner, 1984, and Goldman Sachs.

If you're excited to build at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and real-world impact — we'd love to meet you.

About the Role

There are so many natural opportunities to infuse Fay's product with AI, from serving up highly creative and custom meal plans to streamlining the note-taking and appointment preparation that consumes so much of dietitians' time. Our list of AI-powered features is long and keeps growing, which means the Fay AI Team has its hands full with interesting, high-impact work and would love to have more smart and experienced AI engineers join the effort. We're looking for AI engineers who possess both a strong understanding of machine learning fundamentals and industry experience shipping AI features to users at scale — with an emphasis on generative AI.

What You'll be Doing:


Zero-to-one feature development: Prove out AI feature ideas, iterate on them and integrate them into the product when they're ready for prime time
Data curation and processing: Design the workflows and processes for gathering and storing data for model training
Model training: Fine-tune LLMs to unlock performance for our specific domain applications that's far beyond what off-the-shelf models can offer
Model evaluation: Rigorously evaluate the performance of your work using whatever method is appropriate, from human preferences/labels to synthetic ground truth
Technical leadership: In this role you'll have others looking to you for guidance on AI best practices and, more specifically, how to work with LLMs effectively


The best companies are made of the best people. There's no shortage of work ahead, but we stay balanced and look forward to celebrating our wins as a team.

See our careers page here to learn more about working on our team.

Fay is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

At Sierra, we’re creating a platform to help businesses build better, more human customer experiences with AI. We are primarily an in-person company based in San Francisco, with growing offices in Atlanta, New York, and London.

Elevate our platform by inventing and benchmarking algorithms that make LLM-powered workflows much more reliable and robust.
Advance the field through peer-reviewed papers, open datasets, and collaborations with leading academic & industry labs.


What You'll Own


Invent & prototype new ideas: turn white-board ideas into controlled experiments and live demos.
Push LLM frontiers: combine large-language models with retrieval, symbolic reasoning, or classic ML; optimize for accuracy, reliability, robustness, latency, and cost.
Measure ruthlessly: Define crisp hypotheses, select fit-for-purpose metrics (incl. human-in-the-loop), run statistically sound studies, and iterate fast.
Publish & open-source: Write high-quality papers, release evaluation suites, and present at NeurIPS/ACL/ICML—or local meet-ups if that's your style.
Seed the future: Maintain a balanced portfolio: near-term product wins, mid-term reliability projects, and ""moon-shot"" research that could 10× our differentiation.
Level-up the team: Lead paper clubs, mentor interns & junior scientists, and model best practices in reproducible science and kind collaboration.


What You'll Bring


PhD (or equivalent depth) in ML, Physics, Math, Engineering, computational linguistics, or a closely related field.
Proven research chops: First-author publications at top venues (NeurIPS, ACL, ICML, EMNLP, etc.).
LLM mastery: experience fine-tuning, prompt-engineering, and augmenting models with external knowledge/tooling.
Experimental rigor: fluent in benchmarking, statistical testing, and clear visualization of complex results.
Production-grade coding: Python + ML stacks (PyTorch/JAX), version control, and comfort reading & contributing to large codebases; bonus for database fluency (Neo4j, Postgres, MongoDB).
Storytelling skills: you can explain a log-probability trick to executives and translate product pain-points into concrete research questions.
Bonus points for: open-source maintainer experience, safety/bias evaluation expertise, or a successful track record of bridging academia and industry.

🌟 Your Impact at Lila

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Scientist (Open-Endedness) across Scientist I/II and Senior Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

🛠️ What You'll Be Building


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


🧰 What You’ll Need To Succeed


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


PhD + 3 years, MS/MA + 6 years or BS/BA 8 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

In your first year you will deliver analyses and experiments that improve core product metrics—match quality, time-to-hire, candidate experience, and revenue. You will:


Define north-star and feature-level metrics for our ranking, interview analytics, and payouts systems.
Design and run A/B tests and quasi-experiments; translate results into product decisions within the same week.
Develop source-of-truth dashboards and concise data models to enable teams to self-serve answers.
Collaborate with engineers to instrument events and improve data quality and processing latency from ingestion to insight.
Prototype lightweight models (from baseline methods to gradient-boosted trees) to improve matching and scoring.
Contribute to the evaluation of LLM-powered agents by designing evaluation rubrics, human-in-the-loop studies, and guardrail canaries.


You will thrive here if

You have solid fundamentals in statistics, SQL, and Python, and maintain projects you are prepared to demonstrate. You iterate quickly—frame the question, test, and implement solutions within days—and place as much value on clear communication as on statistical rigor. Familiarity with LLM evaluation, retrieval, and ranking is a plus; you will have the opportunity to learn alongside colleagues with experience at Jane Street, Citadel, Databricks, and Stripe.

Qualifications


0–2 years in data science/analytics or a similar role; BS/BA in a quantitative field (or equivalent practical experience).
Strong SQL skills and Python for analysis; comfortable with experiment design and causal thinking.
Communicates clearly and concisely with engineers, product managers, and leadership; translates analysis into actionable recommendations.
Nice-to-haves: dbt, dashboarding (Hex/Mode/Looker), marketplace or search/recommendation metrics, LLM/agent evaluation.

We are training large-scale models that predict on-the-job performance more accurately than any human interview. Our platform already powers hiring at top AI labs, and we scaled from $1M to $100M ARR in 11 months—making us the fastest-growing AI startup on record.

What You’ll Do

In your first year you’ll ship analyses and experiments that move core product metrics—match quality, time-to-hire, candidate experience, and revenue. You’ll:


Define north-star and feature-level metrics for our ranking, interview analytics, and payouts systems.
Design/run A/B tests and quasi-experiments; turn results into product decisions the same week.
Build source-of-truth dashboards and lightweight data models so teams can self-serve answers.
Instrument events with engineers; improve data quality and latency from ingestion to insight.
Prototype quick models (from baselines to gradient boosting) to improve matching and scoring.
Help evaluate LLM-powered agents: design rubrics, human-in-the-loop studies, and guardrail canaries.


You’ll thrive here if

You have solid fundamentals (statistics, SQL, Python) and projects you’re proud to demo. You iterate fast—frame the question, test, and ship in days—and care as much about clarity of communication as you do about p-values. Curiosity about LLM evaluation, retrieval, and ranking is a bonus; you’ll learn alongside folks who’ve shipped at Jane Street, Citadel, Databricks, and Stripe.

Qualifications


0–2 years in data science/analytics or similar; BS/BA in a quantitative field (or equivalent work).
Strong SQL; Python for analysis; comfort with experiment design and causal thinking.
Communicates crisply with engineers, PMs, and leadership; turns analysis into action.
Nice-to-haves: dbt, dashboarding (Hex/Mode/Looker), marketplace or search/recommendation metrics, LLM/agent evaluation.


Perks


Generous liquid equity compensation
$20K relocation bonus
$10K housing bonus
$1K/month food stipend
Free Equinox membership
Health insurance


We consider all qualified applicants without regard to legally protected characteristics and provide reasonable accommodations upon request.

Uber's newly formed AI Security team, part of the Core Security Engineering organization, is building the foundation for dynamic, data-driven security systems. We're evolving Uber's Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to be more risk-adaptive across authentication and authorization, moving beyond static rules and manual approvals toward real-time, ML-driven access decisions that secure both humans and AI agents without slowing them down.

As a Senior ML Engineer, you'll translate ambiguous business and security needs into concrete ML problems, design and iterate on solutions, and take them end-to-end into production. This is greenfield work at the intersection of ML, security, and infrastructure, shaping how Uber secures AI at scale.

Basic Qualifications


5+ years experience building and deploying ML models in production, with hands-on work in feature engineering, training, and evaluation.
Proficiency across a broad range of ML algorithms: tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM), classical statistical models (logistic regression, SVMs), and deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers), with the ability to select and apply the right approach based on context and data.
Hands-on experience with feature engineering, model development, and productionization of ML pipelines.
Proficiency in PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar ML frameworks, and in Python or comparable languages for scalable, production-grade systems.


Preferred Qualifications


Proven ability to own ML systems end-to-end: from requirement discovery → feature design → modeling → deployment.
Deep experience with advanced ML techniques, including ensemble methods, neural networks, graph-based models, and handling challenges like imbalanced data, feedback loops, and iterative retraining.
Familiarity with large-scale data/infra systems (Kafka, Pinot, Hive, Cassandra, Spark, Flink).
Background in access control, authentication, or enterprise security systems.
Track record of technical leadership: mentoring engineers, driving cross-functional initiatives, or shaping ML/security strategy.


What The Candidate Will Do


Translate business and security needs into well-defined ML problems.
Develop, iterate, and productionize ML models that drive risk-adaptive decisions in real-time.
Engineer features from Uber's risk systems, logs, and contextual signals.
Integrate ML systems into Uber's critical access pathways (containers, APIs, gateways, data).
Collaborate across Security, Risk, and Infra teams to deliver scalable, production-ready solutions.
Provide leadership by mentoring junior engineers, evangelize ML best practices, and help shape ML strategy within AI Security.

We are opening a Junior AI Developer position! This is a one-of-a-kind recruitment, so we have several points to cover 👇

Who are we?

We are a software development company based in Wrocław. We have been creating products for 15 years now, partnering with clients to deliver outstanding software solutions. We are not a product company, which means you'll get to work on a diverse range of projects and technologies.

Why are we opening this recruitment?

A few years ago, we started helping develop talents from their first steps. We organised boot camps and met passionate people in the process. We are still collaborating with some of the great developers we met back then and have seen them grow within Monterail. We want to return to those times and help new, ambitious talent shape their careers with us, this time with a focus on the future of development: AI.

What we expect from you?

🧠 An AI-First Mindset

This is about more than just using AI tools; it's about a mindset. We're looking for a developer who actively and thoughtfully integrates AI into their workflow. You should be someone who is constantly exploring how AI can help you learn faster, solve complex problems, and build better software. You're not just a ""vibe-coder""; you're a true developer who understands how to strategically leverage AI as a powerful assistant to amplify your skills.

🛠️ First Experience with Coding

It doesn't have to be a commercial one, but you need to show us what you can do. We want to see your pet projects, portfolio, or GitHub profile. Familiarity with React or Vue.js on a basic level is needed—this is a junior position, not a boot camp! What's crucial for us is that you have hands-on experience using AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor to write code, and prototyping tools like Vercel v0, Lovable, or Bolt.new to take an idea from concept to a working prototype.

🏢 Willingness to Come to the Office

We believe that to help you grow, we need to see each other face-to-face. As you become more independent, we can move towards a hybrid model. However, at the beginning, work from our Wrocław office (near Galeria Dominikańska) is required.

Good to have:


Experience with Supabase
Familiarity with hosting platforms like Vercel
A deeper understanding of how Large Language Models (LLMs) work
Experience using the OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini APIs
Familiarity with the Vercel AI SDK
Experience building simple automations with tools like n8n or Make


What can you expect from us?

🎓 Accelerated Learning

We have the right people, extensive know-how, and diverse projects you can learn from. Because every client is different, we can show you large legacy corporate projects, and the next day, help you build a commercial MVP from scratch with the newest AI tools available.

💡 A Space for Innovation

Show us your point of view, energy, and enthusiasm for AI. With full support from your leader and colleagues, you will have the space to experiment and make things happen.

🌎 International Perspective

Our colleagues and clients come from all over the world. You will gain a global perspective on communication and software development.

And that's a wrap! Hope to see you at the interview! 👋


Due to the high number of applications, we will only contact selected candidates. The response time may be extended

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-5 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience

Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

QAD calls these companies Adaptive Manufacturing Enterprises.<br><br>QAD Redzone helps to enable QAD’s vision for the Adaptive Enterprise. Labor productivity improvements directly impact efficiency. Productive and empowered employees increase the effective capacity of your plant and accelerate time to productivity for new employees giving manufacturers the agility to increase production beyond what was previously possible without having to invest in production equipment or new plants, and reduce the amount and impact of employee attrition. Empowered employees with a growth mindset take extreme ownership of challenges that impact their production goals, creating resilience in the face of disruption.<br><br>We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and do not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, sex, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, status as a veteran, and basis of disability or any other federal, state or local protected class.<br><br>

Bumbee Labs är ett innovativt techbolag i scale-up-fasen som gör avtryck globalt med vår unika produkt. Vi har utvecklat en unik metod för att mäta och analysera flödesdata – att förstå hur människor rör sig och beter sig – med hjälp av Wi-Fi-teknologi.

Vår kärnprodukt är data – men ännu viktigare är de insikter vi skapar av den.




Din roll

Som Data Scientist kommer du att vara en del av vårt analysteam och arbeta praktiskt med att förädla vår data, utveckla modeller och säkerställa att våra leveranser håller hög kvalitet. Du kommer att bidra till att förbättra våra metoder för kalibrering, validering och analys – och därigenom skapa ännu bättre insikter för våra kunder.

Du arbetar nära våra utvecklare, implementationsteam och kundansvariga för att förstå både den tekniska sidan och kundernas behov. Rollen är en blandning av analys, problemlösning och samarbete.




Ansvarsområden
Analysera och bearbeta stora datamängder
Bidra till utveckling och förbättring av statistiska modeller
Stödja vid uppsättning och kalibrering av nya installationer
Säkerställa datakvalitet och bidra till validering av resultat
Samarbeta med kollegor för att omsätta kundernas behov i datadrivna lösningar
Bidra med insikter och underlag till visualiseringar (t.ex. i Power BI), men utan krav på att själv bygga dashboards




Vem vi söker

Du är analytisk, noggrann och tycker om att arbeta med data i olika former. Du är nyfiken på hur människor rör sig i fysiska miljöer och vill använda din kompetens till att skapa insikter som gör skillnad.

Vi ser gärna att du har:

Erfarenhet av dataanalys och statistisk modellering
Programmeringsvana i Python
Kunskap i PostgreSQL och gärna PostGIS
Intresse för geospatial data och mobilitetsmönster
Viss erfarenhet av datavisualisering (Power BI, Tableau eller liknande) är meriterande, men inget krav




Vår kultur

På Bumbee Labs kombinerar vi djup teknisk kompetens med en kreativ och samarbetsinriktad arbetsmiljö. Vi brainstormar, testar och utmanar idéer varje dag – och vi har kul längs vägen. Vårt kontor ligger i hjärtat av Stockholm, där kreativitet och innovation får utrymme att blomma.




Vill du vara med och utveckla framtidens platsanalys med hjälp av Wi-Fi-data? Skicka in din ansökan och bli en del av vårt team.

L'entreprise

NETRI

NETRI is an industrial start-up developing innovative technologies for the pharmaceutical industry. Everything we do, we believe in challenging the way we discover new treatments. We use neural activity at the network level to translate mode of action of any drugs. We design, manufacture and sell standardized neuro organsoids-on-chip.

Our patented neuro organsoids-on-chip technologies allow the creation of standardized and predictive human in vitro models. This allows to anticipate the efficacy of an innovative treatment, to accelerate preclinical research phases, and to reposition compounds on new indications, while limiting animal testing. The use of human neural circuits coupled with multiple cell types opens the way to more personalized medicine as well as faster and more relevant diagnostics. Our current application areas include neurological disorders, dermo-cosmetics and toxicology.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

🌟 Your Impact at Lila

As a Data Scientist in our Physical Sciences organization, you will transform complex experimental and testing datasets into actionable insights that drive our autonomous lab’s decision-making. You’ll partner with electrochemists, synthesis chemists, characterization specialists, and automation engineers to ensure data quality, build predictive models, and inform scientific campaigns across materials and device development.

🛠️ What You'll Be Building 

Data Infrastructure: Design and maintain robust ETL pipelines to ingest, validate, and preprocess data from diverse sources—electrochemical tests, materials characterization, and automated lab instruments.
Feature Engineering & Modeling: Perform domain-relevant data transformations, extract meaningful descriptors from raw data (e.g., voltage curves, spectroscopic signatures, image-based measurements) and develop statistical or machine learning models to relate independent variables (time, composition, etc.) to performance metrics and failure modes.
Analytics & Visualization: Create interactive dashboards and reports to communicate trends, anomalies, and key insights to scientific and engineering teams.
Active Learning Support: Collaborate with ML scientists to integrate your analytical outputs into active learning loops, helping to prioritize experiments and optimize resource allocation.
Cross-Functional Partnership: Work closely with R&D leadership, Product Managers, and automation specialists to translate scientific questions into data requirements and modeling strategies.
Reproducibility & Documentation: Establish best practices for code versioning, data provenance, and analysis notebooks; contribute to internal knowledge bases and publications.

🧰 What You’ll Need to Succeed

Master’s or Ph.D. in Data Science, Statistics, Materials Science, Chemistry, Physics, or a related quantitative field.
2+ years of experience in data analysis, statistical modeling, or machine learning—ideally applied to physical sciences or engineering datasets.
Proficiency in Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) and SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
Hands-on experience building ETL workflows using tools like Airflow, Prefect, or similar.
Strong foundation in experimental design, statistical inference, and multivariate analysis.
Familiarity with data visualization libraries (Plotly, Dash, or similar) and dashboard frameworks.

✨ Bonus Points For


Experience working with electrochemical or materials characterization data (e.g., impedance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy).
Materials-specific python libraries (pymatgen)
Exposure to cloud-based data platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and scalable storage solutions.
Knowledge of containerization (Docker, Singularity) and workflow orchestration (Snakemake, Nextflow).
Prior contributions to open-source data tools or scientific software.
Understanding of active learning, Bayesian optimization, or uncertainty quantification in experimental contexts.

All voices are heard because we know that experience comes in many forms, skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

🌟 Your Impact at Lila

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Scientist (Open-Endedness) across Scientist I/II and Senior Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level.   

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration.  The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models.  In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself. 

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques. 

🛠️ What You'll Be Building

Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors 
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness 
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it  
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.  

🧰 What You’ll Need to Succeed

PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements 
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC  
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation 
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters). 

🌈 We’re All In

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth




About the opportunity:

Jerry is looking for a data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company, with a focus on optimizing growth channels such as partnerships, marketing, and automation. As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.




Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.




Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).




The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.




I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""




How you will make an impact:

Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency




Preferred experience:

Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python




Who you are:

You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence

Coordinate with the AI Platform Architect to ensure your solutions align with architectural standards for security, scalability, and governance, and with the AI Infrastructure Engineer to deploy, monitor, and maintain these AI solutions in production environments.
Testing and Iteration: Rigorously test AI models and applications, validate their accuracy and effectiveness (including handling of edge cases), and iterate based on feedback and performance metrics.
Monitor Performance: Monitor and evaluate the performance of deployed AI models and solutions, identifying areas for improvement and implementing necessary adjustments for accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.



Qualifications



Education: Bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, or a related field.
Experience: 3+ years of experience in software development or AI/ML engineering, with a track record of building or implementing AI-driven solutions.
LLM & RAG Expertise: Demonstrated experience working with large language models and natural language processing, including fine-tuning models and applying retrieval-augmented generation techniques to ground AI outputs in relevant data.
Analytical Skills: Strong ability to analyze complex data and model performance metrics, identifying and resolving issues to improve outcomes.
