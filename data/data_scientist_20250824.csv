About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics. The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

Requirements

Location: Only for applicants from Germany

Language: German - Fluent, English - Fluent

Your Toolbelt


3+ years of hands-on experience in Data Science
You’re comfortable working with large-scale, messy datasets – even the kind that don’t fit into memory
For you state-of-the-art-methods are not just the methods everybody use. You are not afraid to search for answers in scientific literature.
Strong mathematical intuition – you don’t just apply models; you want to understand why they work
You follow best practices by default, and know when it’s time to question them


Your Tools


Python – comfy with pandas, scikit-learn & friends
Data Science basics – from feature engineering to model validation
SQL – joins, aggregations, subqueries? No problem
Docker & Linux – smooth setup and deployment
AI/ML – real models, not just slide decks
Git – because version control is second nature


Bonus Skills (nice to have):

Apache Spark / Kubernetes / Prefect, Airflow or similar / Torch, VLLM, or LLM-related tooling / pydantic.ai or similar / Shell scripting

Activities

Is your idea of fun wrangling messy data, debugging ML pipelines, and running experiments that actually tell you something? Do you know that correlation ≠ causation, and that pandas aren't just cute animals? 🐼 If your heart beats faster for code, queries, and questions, keep reading. At smartclip, we’re on the hunt for a Data Scientist who’s less into dashboards for the sake of dashboards, and more into uncovering what really matters behind the metrics.


Explore terabytes of real-world data, not toy datasets
Work on questions that don’t have answers on StackOverflow (yet)
Build and improve data products and ML models with a team of domain experts
Have the freedom to use the right tool for the right job, not just the fashionable one


Team

🤝 We believe in flat hierarchies and fast decision-making processes.

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

You would be joining a flexible and dynamic team and your role will include:


selecting features, building and optimizing classifiers using machine learning techniques
processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
deep dive on the problems using SQL and scripting languages to drive solutions leveraging Statistical Analysis
implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone. Our recruitment process is free from discrimination of any kind — including on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

Form of Employment: Full-time

Starting Date: As soon as possible

Application Deadline: 24 August 2025


Please note that this position may be closed earlier than the deadline if a certain number of applications are received; therefore, early applications are encouraged.


Contract Duration: initially 2 years, with the possibility of extension.

Location: Berlin

Democracy Reporting International (DRI) is a non-partisan, independent, not-for-profit organisation registered in Berlin. DRI promotes the political participation of citizens, accountability of state bodies, and the development of democratic institutions worldwide.

DRI’s Europe team works on democracy-related issues across the EU, its neighbours and accession countries. Thematically, our work centres on enabling public participation, protecting the rule of law, strengthening local governance, reducing polarisation, and promoting democratic innovation. The team is also closely collaborating with DRI’s digital democracy unit, which deals with issues of political disinformation, hate speech, algorithms, and platform design in the region.

DRI is engaged in several key projects related to the rule of law, human rights and judiciary in Europe. These include work on promoting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, strengthening strategic litigation on the rule of law and fundamental rights and supporting the accession process of countries wishing to join the EU. We are implementing our flagship ‘re:constitution: Exchange and Analysis on Democracy and the Rule of Law in Europe’ programme, aimed at facilitating a fact-based debate around topical questions on the rule of law across the European Union, by providing timely and relevant analyses aimed at supporting policymakers and journalists in shaping the discourse on the rule of law.

To expand its research and analysis capability, DRI is looking for a full-time Research Officer for our head office in Berlin. This position is subject to the expected approval of funding.

The prospective candidate should have a strong knowledge of EU law and public law in EU Member States, ideally with a particular focus on matters related to the judiciary; strong communication skills (especially in communicating legal issues to a non-specialist audience), good command of social media and experience in engaging with journalists and policymakers. The person should also be a team player, ready to take the initiative and enjoy working in a diverse, multi-cultural setting.

Your work will help us strengthen the public debate on the rule of law in the EU, and you’ll have plenty of chances to contribute to our other projects carried out in Europe, as well as to contribute to pursuing new opportunities and develop new initiatives.

Your tasks

Under the supervision of the Research Coordinator and in close coordination with the relevant programme managers, you will:


Monitor legal and political developments related to the rule of law in Europe, with a particular focus on Western European EU member states, such as topical debates, legal reforms, landmark court cases or administrative proceedings;
Suggest thematic areas for deeper research and reporting;
Draft, review, finalise, and conceptualise diverse project outputs: analytical pieces, explainers, fact sheets, infographics, short videos, etc.;
Work with our Communications Team on shaping project outputs and delivering them to target audiences;
Give interviews to journalists, represent DRI at meetings, seminars and conferences;
Engage with policymakers from EU institutions, international organisations, Member State governments and other authorities;

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


PhD + 3 years, MS/MA + 6 years or BS/BA 8 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

CSC Generation is on a mission to build the most advanced AI-driven retail operating system in the industry. Our brands—including Sur La Table, One Kings Lane, and Backcountry—rely on fast, intelligent decision-making rooted in high-integrity data.

We’re hiring an AI-First Data Scientist who combines deep statistical and machine learning expertise with modern MLOps tooling and automation instincts. You will design and deploy production-ready ML solutions, leveraging cutting-edge platforms like AWS Sagemaker, Vertiv, and advanced causal inference techniques such as Double Machine Learning (DML). Your work will not just inform decisions—it will automate, scale, and embed intelligence directly into our operating systems.

This is a highly technical, hands-on role with direct business impact. You’ll be embedded with senior operators and report directly to a brand CEO or platform leader, supporting mission-critical decisions and creating AI systems that improve themselves over time.




What You Get to Do Every Day

Lead the end‑to‑end ML lifecycle—from problem framing and data preparation through model training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
Build reliable data pipelines and features; ensure data quality, reproducibility, documentation, and auditability, on cloud-native platforms (e.g. AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI)
Develop predictive and causal models; design experiments to quantify impact and guide decision‑making.
Apply modern MLOps practices (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, CI/CD, observability) to keep models robust and maintainable.
Translate model outputs into clear recommendations; partner with stakeholders to drive adoption and iterate based on results.
Collaborate with engineering and product on secure integration, performance, and cost‑efficiency.
Continuously research and apply emerging techniques in AI, including generative AI, automated feature engineering, and reinforcement learning.




What You Bring to the Role

5+ years’ experience in applied data science/ML with a track record of deploying models to production.
Bachelor’s or Master’s in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, or related quantitative field.
Proficiency in Python and SQL; strong software engineering practices (version control, testing, reproducibility).
Experience with cloud‑based ML workflows and processing data at scale.
Familiarity with MLOps concepts (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, automated deployment, CI/CD).
Experience across predictive, time‑series, and causal modeling; ability to design experiments, A/B testing, and interpret impact.
Excellent communication: able to present complex work to non‑technical stakeholders and drive action.
Curiosity and a bias for building autonomous, decision‑supporting systems.




Why This Role is Different

Most data scientist roles focus on building models that live in notebooks. This one takes those models all the way to production—where they shape decisions in real time.

You won’t just be running experiments—you’ll be building the future of how our business thinks and operates. You’ll integrate AI directly into decision loops, create reusable data science products, and champion a culture of AI-first thinking across the organization.




What’s in it for you? Joining CSC Generation isn’t just about having a seat at the table—it’s about helping redesign the table entirely. You’ll be challenged, stretched, and supported as you grow faster than you thought possible. In addition to competitive compensation, we offer:

Executive Access: Work directly with brand CEOs and senior leadership, solving real business problems and earning mentorship from top operators.
AI-First Skill Building: Get hands-on with the most advanced AI tools in the market. From automation to prompt engineering, you’ll build a modern tech stack that sets you apart in any industry.
Accelerated Career Path: High performers are quickly entrusted with greater responsibility, new challenges, and leadership opportunities across our portfolio of brands.
Competitive benefits: Paid time off policies, 401(k)/RRSP match, medical/dental/vision and a variety of supplemental policies, and employee discounts at our portfolio companies

What our interview process looks like:

📞 Step 1: If you align with our vision and meet the qualifications, we’ll reach out to schedule a conversation and introduce CSC.
🧠 Step 2: You’ll complete a short AI or product-building challenge so we can understand how you approach problems and execution.
💬 Step 3: Participate in deep-dive interviews with CSC leadership focused on your experience, product mindset, and operational thinking.
📩 Step 4: Offer. We’ll move fast for the right candidate.

Your models don't just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you, read on.

AlgaeCal is on the hunt for an Intermediate Data Scientist to develop mathematical algorithms and apply machine learning to analyze business data, test hypotheses, and turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.

This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we're driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world's only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you'll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.

This job might be for you if you've got...


2+ years experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You've built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don't just analyze numbers, you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You've used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that'll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis
Kaggle-level knowledge of artificial intelligence models. And if you think RAG is something you clean your countertops with, this probably isn't the role for you.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it's regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don't just apply models, you understand how they work under the hood
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You've worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You're the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don't just crunch numbers, you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You're proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


PhD + 3 years, MS/MA + 6 years or BS/BA 8 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

TEAM: SALT MEDIA

LOCATION: TORONTO (HYBRID)

TERM: 6 MONTH CONTRACT

Company Overview

Ready to shape the future of AI-driven advertising and build products that transform how brands connect with audiences? We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our team at Salt Media and be a part of the evolution.

Every day at Salt Media, we’re facilitating more informed, valuable conversations between companies and the people they serve. We’re driven by our mission to “Bring Audiences Home”—helping brands cut through irrelevant noise and connect with people who truly care.

As an AI-driven media agency powered by our own proprietary products, we help clients make smarter, more impactful ad buying decisions while delivering a better experience for brands and consumers alike. Our product suite and unique in-house service models blend the best of data science and marketing, empowering clients to take ownership of their digital media, social buying, and first-party data strategies.

Our Current Product Suite Includes


Podium, our next-gen media mix modelling and measurement platform
Frontrunnr, our automated social boosting and ad optimization platform
Media Mob, our creator discovery platform


…and this is just the beginning. We're constantly ideating and building. As one of our Data Scientists, you'll play a pivotal role not only in shaping and refining these products but also in envisioning and creating the next wave of transformative products that will define our future.

About You

If you’re an engineer who loves building product, has an ownership mentality and is someone who constantly wants to learn and evolve, here are a few reasons why you might be excited to join Salt Media:


Work with Cutting-Edge AI
AI isn’t just a buzzword for us — it’s in our DNA. As a Data Scientist, you’ll engage directly with generative models, ML-driven decision-making tools, and advanced data pipelines. You’ll use licensed AI tools internally to enhance your daily workflows and collaborate with colleagues, and will be given regular opportunities to explore and learn new tooling to help us all stay ahead of the curve and work smarter.
High-Impact, Varied Environment
You won’t be pigeonholed into a narrow engineering role. Instead, you’ll tackle a variety of challenges, on a variety of products, from improving backend architectures and optimizing models to experimenting with new tools and frameworks. Your work will make an immediate, visible difference to clients and the company’s trajectory.
Autonomy and Ownership
Rather than waiting for permission, you’ll propose solutions, influence product direction, and shape development processes. Our flat org structure eliminates red tape and encourages direct communication. If you see an opportunity to build something better, you run with it.
Exposure to the Entire Business
At Salt Media, you won’t be isolated in your own technical corner. You’ll collaborate closely with product leaders, data scientists, client-facing teams, and even the CEO. This cross-functional exposure expands your understanding of the product and customers, helping you hone both technical and business skills.
Fast-Paced Growth and Learning
Ad tech is evolving quickly, and we move with it. That means constant learning, continuous improvement, and never feeling stuck in outdated tech stacks or stale processes. As the company grows, so do your opportunities—new responsibilities, new projects, and a larger platform to showcase your talents.
A Culture of Curiosity and Transparency
Expect open communication, direct feedback, and a culture that values curiosity and problem solving over rigid hierarchies. You’ll join a team that encourages questions, celebrates breakthroughs, and is genuinely excited about building product to shake up a traditional industry.

We’re a spatial intelligence platform that tracks occupancy and usage patterns, analyzes how spaces are used, and turns those insights into better decisions.




We’re hiring an Intermediate Data Scientist who loves building algorithms more than plumbing pipelines. You’ll work end-to-end in a small, mighty team, using Azure Databricks with PySpark and Delta Lake, publishing to Snowflake. Our work is batch-first with streaming awareness, privacy-conscious by design, and all about turning messy spatiotemporal data into clear, actionable signals.




What you’ll do

Design, build, and ship algorithms that extract signal from noisy indoor movement and occupancy data.
Frame problems, invent features and heuristics, and benchmark approaches with clear baselines and metrics.
Build scalable data processing jobs in PySpark or an equivalent big-data framework, and publish results to Snowflake.
Partner with engineers and stakeholders to translate findings into product and customer outcomes.
Monitor models in the wild: quality checks, drift detection, and pragmatic iteration.
Contribute to data quality remediation at scale and help us choose system architectures that fit the algorithms’ needs.




What you’ll bring

Canada-based and legally able to work in Canada.
2–5 years in DS or ML with evidence of building or significantly modifying algorithms, not just applying defaults.
Strong Python and SQL on large datasets.
Hands-on big-data processing experience such as PySpark, Spark on EMR or Dataproc, Flink, or Dask. Databricks, Snowflake, and Delta Lake are strong pluses.
Clear, concise communication with non-technical partners, and comfort owning work end-to-end in a small team.
Extra points for experience with streaming data, sensor or spatiotemporal analysis, trajectory analysis, Bayesian methods, or spatial data.




How we work

Explorers thrive here. We often chase answers that may not exist yet. You won’t need hand-holding, and you’ll be comfortable being wrong on the way to being right. If you love untangling complexity, living in code, and shipping elegant solutions, you’ll feel at home.




You’ll join a remote-first team in Canada, where end-to-end ownership is the norm and thoughtful engineering beats shiny dashboards. We value small teams, clear decisions, and evidence over buzzwords.




Tech you’ll use

Azure Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake
Snowflake
Python, SQL
Plus the right tools for robust benchmarking, monitoring, and data quality




Perks and benefits

Competitive compensation with equity
Remote-first in Canada
Every long weekend is four days long
Inclusive, accessible hiring process and workplace
Equal opportunity employer




Our hiring process

15-minute phone screen focused on mutual fit.
Practical technical exercise aligned with our real-world problems
Team conversation to talk through trade-offs, baselines, and how you’ve shipped in production.




Ready to explore?

If you’ve designed custom features or heuristics, created non-default objectives or decision rules, built benchmarking frameworks, or authored core inference logic, we want to talk. Send us your resume and a short note about one algorithm you’re proud of — what you tried, what you measured, and why it won.




Currently, we are only able to consider applicants who are legally allowed to work in Canada.

We are committed to providing a barrier-free work environment in concert with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act and the Ontario Human Rights Code. As such, we will make accommodations available to applicants with disabilities upon request during the recruitment process.

At AlgaeCal, we're driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world's only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you'll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.

This job might be for you if you've got...


2+ years experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You've built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don't just analyze numbers, you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You've used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that'll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis
Kaggle-level knowledge of artificial intelligence models. And if you think RAG is something you clean your countertops with, this probably isn't the role for you.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it's regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don't just apply models, you understand how they work under the hood
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You've worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You're the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don't just crunch numbers, you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You're proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability
Industry know-how that adds value. If you've got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that's a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI


Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you're nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can't wait to meet you.

The truth is, if you don't have these qualities you won't last long at AlgaeCal. So if you're missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.

What Will You Earn?

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Spring Financial is revolutionizing financial access for Canadians, providing smart credit-building, mortgage, and lending solutions. Millions struggle with high-interest debt and limited financial options—we’re here to change that.

As one of Canada’s fastest-growing fintech companies, annually we help 1 million customers explore their financing options with ease—online, via text, or over the phone. Our dynamic, innovative team thrives on collaboration, growth, and making a real impact.

To learn more about our products please visit our website here: www.springfinancial.ca.




NOTE: This is a full-time, permanent, hybrid position in downtown Vancouver, with 3 set days in the office and 2 WFH.




Job Overview:

As a Machine Learning Engineer II, you independently design, build, and maintain machine learning systems that deliver impact for our customers and business. You are responsible for deploying reliable, scalable solutions — from credit scoring models to intelligent automation and LLM-powered features. You work across the stack to connect ML systems with real user value.

You own end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and transformation to model training, validation, and online inference. You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.




What you’ll do:

Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.

What You Should Already Have:

Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.




What We Will Give You:

Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.

If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more. Due to high application volume, we may not be able to respond to everyone.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.




About the Role:




We're seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to bridge the gap between our data products, data science insights and production systems. You'll be responsible for taking ML models from concept to production, building robust MLOps infrastructure, and ensuring our machine learning systems operate reliably at scale. This role focuses on the engineering aspects of ML design, deployment, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure.




What you will do:




Design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion to model serving
Build automated model training, validation, and deployment workflows using CI/CD best practices
Develop and maintain MLOps infrastructure for model versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment
Create robust monitoring and alerting systems for model performance, data drift, and system health
Optimize model inference performance and cost for production workloads
Collaborate with our Data Engineers to design and implement feature stores and feature pipelines
Develop automated data quality checks and validation frameworks for ML pipelines
Build scalable feature engineering workflows that support both batch and real-time inference
Implement data versioning and lineage tracking for reproducible ML workflows
Partner with Software Data Scientists to productionize research models and experiments
Implement frameworks for model evaluation and gradual rollouts
Design automated retraining pipelines and model refresh strategies
Establish best practices for model governance, documentation, and compliance
Work closely with Software Engineers to integrate ML capabilities into existing applications
Contribute to architectural decisions for scalable, maintainable ML systems
Participate in code reviews, documentation, and knowledge sharing across teams
Mentor junior engineers on ML engineering best practices




The right person for this role will have:




3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, MLOps, or related fields
Strong proficiency in Python for ML development and automation
Solid SQL skills for data manipulation and analysis
Hands-on experience with AWS or other cloud platforms (Azure, or GCP) and their ML services
Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for ML workloads
Proficiency with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and MLOps tools
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code principles
Databricks experience is a plus
Experience with feature engineering at scale and feature store implementations
Understanding of model monitoring, observability, and production ML challenges
Knowledge of data quality frameworks and automated testing for ML systems
Familiarity with distributed computing frameworks (Databricks or Sagemaker) for large-scale ML
Experience with experiment tracking and model versioning tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases, etc.)




Bonus points if you have:




Master's or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or related quantitative field Experience with real-time ML inference and streaming data pipelines
Knowledge of AutoML platforms and automated hyperparameter tuning
Familiarity with model compression, quantization, and edge deployment Experience with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud ML architectures
Contributions to open-source ML tools or platforms




Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
4 weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 days of the year




Application process:

Please submit your resume highlighting relevant experience and include a cover letter explaining your interest in the specific role
Provide links to relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or publications
Be prepared to discuss technical projects and problem-solving approaches in interviews

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!
