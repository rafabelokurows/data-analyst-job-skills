Polar Analytics simplifies data so brands can make smarter, faster decisions without the complexity of traditional tools. Powerful yet user-friendly, it gives DTC brands the insights they need to scale profitably.

🚀 Our mission? To help indie DTC brands compete and grow—faster and more profitably.

What Makes Polar Analytics Unique? 💎

🔥 4,000+ Brands and Growing

We’ve scaled to 4,000+ active merchants (Jan 2025) and are on track for 10,000+ this year.

💡 Cutting-edge tech, Built for Simplicity

We leverage the modern data stack to deliver enterprise-level insights—without the need for a data team.

💰 Backed by World-Class Investors

We’ve raised $28.5M with Frst, Point9, and Chalfen Ventures, a top-tier B2B SaaS investor known for spotting future unicorns early.

👥 A Team of eCommerce Experts

Our team brings experience from leading eCommerce SaaS platforms, united by a mission to build the next industry leader.

Solutions Engineering At Polar Analytics

Solutions Engineering at Polar Analytics sits at the heart of Tech, Sales and Custome Success. You'll be architecting the semantic layer that transforms raw commerce data into intelligent, actionable insights. As we scale, you'll design proofs of concept that close deals fast, lead implementations that deliver value in weeks, and unlock new use cases that directly feed back into our product roadmap. This isn't just technical problem-solving—it's building the data foundation that helps indie DTC brands compete and grow faster than ever before.

Why This Role?


Own the semantic layer for commerce agents - Build the unified data model that turns raw Shopify, ad, and retention data into the language that AI agents understand, creating consistent metrics and business logic across every store and channel
End-to-end impact from pre-sale to expansion - Design compelling proofs of concept that accelerate our sales cycle, then lead implementations that hit time-to-value in weeks while identifying expansion opportunities
High-leverage, high-ownership environment - Write SQL, architect integrations, and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with revenue leaders where your technical decisions directly impact retention and LTV
Strategic seat at the table - Work at the critical intersection of data, product, and revenue where your insights shape both customer success and product development


What's the Scope?


Drive $1M ARR per quarter - Own the technical close for high-value deals through compelling demonstrations, custom proofs of concept, and seamless technical implementations
Launch successful features monthly - Collaborate with Product to translate customer needs into shipped features, using direct customer feedback to influence roadmap priorities
Build power user networks at top logos - Cultivate deep technical relationships with key stakeholders at enterprise accounts, turning them into advocates and expansion opportunities
Partner with the CS team on deal nurturing - Work closely with Customer Success to identify upsell opportunities, resolve technical challenges, and ensure long-term customer satisfaction


This Job is Made for You If:


You think in systems and code fluently - Strong technical foundation with ability to write SQL, architect integrations, and choose the right technology for each challenge
You thrive on direct customer interaction - Natural ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear business value while turning customer feedback into prioritized development work
You sprint but never ship half-baked - Bias toward action with unwavering commitment to quality, ensuring every implementation meets both timeline and excellence standards
You want strategic influence - Seeking a role where data, product, and revenue decisions intersect, with direct input on company direction and customer success

Solutions Engineering At Polar Analytics

Solutions Engineering at Polar Analytics sits at the heart of Tech, Sales and Custome Success. You'll be architecting the semantic layer that transforms raw commerce data into intelligent, actionable insights. As we scale, you'll design proofs of concept that close deals fast, lead implementations that deliver value in weeks, and unlock new use cases that directly feed back into our product roadmap. This isn't just technical problem-solving—it's building the data foundation that helps indie DTC brands compete and grow faster than ever before.

Why This Role?


Own the semantic layer for commerce agents - Build the unified data model that turns raw Shopify, ad, and retention data into the language that AI agents understand, creating consistent metrics and business logic across every store and channel
End-to-end impact from pre-sale to expansion - Design compelling proofs of concept that accelerate our sales cycle, then lead implementations that hit time-to-value in weeks while identifying expansion opportunities
High-leverage, high-ownership environment - Write SQL, architect integrations, and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with revenue leaders where your technical decisions directly impact retention and LTV
Strategic seat at the table - Work at the critical intersection of data, product, and revenue where your insights shape both customer success and product development


What's the Scope?


Drive $1M ARR per quarter - Own the technical close for high-value deals through compelling demonstrations, custom proofs of concept, and seamless technical implementations
Launch successful features monthly - Collaborate with Product to translate customer needs into shipped features, using direct customer feedback to influence roadmap priorities
Build power user networks at top logos - Cultivate deep technical relationships with key stakeholders at enterprise accounts, turning them into advocates and expansion opportunities
Partner with the CS team on deal nurturing - Work closely with Customer Success to identify upsell opportunities, resolve technical challenges, and ensure long-term customer satisfaction


This Job is Made for You If:


You think in systems and code fluently - Strong technical foundation with ability to write SQL, architect integrations, and choose the right technology for each challenge
You thrive on direct customer interaction - Natural ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear business value while turning customer feedback into prioritized development work
You sprint but never ship half-baked - Bias toward action with unwavering commitment to quality, ensuring every implementation meets both timeline and excellence standards
You want strategic influence - Seeking a role where data, product, and revenue decisions intersect, with direct input on company direction and customer success

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, analyzing user behavior on a feature to identify areas of improvement, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data analysis, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

We are training large-scale models that predict on-the-job performance more accurately than any human interview. Our platform already powers hiring at top AI labs, and we scaled from $1M to $100M ARR in 11 months—making us the fastest-growing AI startup on record.

What You’ll Do

In your first year you’ll ship analyses and experiments that move core product metrics—match quality, time-to-hire, candidate experience, and revenue. You’ll:


Define north-star and feature-level metrics for our ranking, interview analytics, and payouts systems.
Design/run A/B tests and quasi-experiments; turn results into product decisions the same week.
Build source-of-truth dashboards and lightweight data models so teams can self-serve answers.
Instrument events with engineers; improve data quality and latency from ingestion to insight.
Prototype quick models (from baselines to gradient boosting) to improve matching and scoring.
Help evaluate LLM-powered agents: design rubrics, human-in-the-loop studies, and guardrail canaries.


You’ll thrive here if

You have solid fundamentals (statistics, SQL, Python) and projects you’re proud to demo. You iterate fast—frame the question, test, and ship in days—and care as much about clarity of communication as you do about p-values. Curiosity about LLM evaluation, retrieval, and ranking is a bonus; you’ll learn alongside folks who’ve shipped at Jane Street, Citadel, Databricks, and Stripe.

Qualifications


0–2 years in data science/analytics or similar; BS/BA in a quantitative field (or equivalent work).
Strong SQL; Python for analysis; comfort with experiment design and causal thinking.
Communicates crisply with engineers, PMs, and leadership; turns analysis into action.
Nice-to-haves: dbt, dashboarding (Hex/Mode/Looker), marketplace or search/recommendation metrics, LLM/agent evaluation.


Perks


Generous liquid equity compensation
$20K relocation bonus
$10K housing bonus
$1K/month food stipend
Free Equinox membership
Health insurance


We consider all qualified applicants without regard to legally protected characteristics and provide reasonable accommodations upon request.

Our co-founders are Bret Taylor and Clay Bavor. Bret currently serves as Board Chair of OpenAI. Previously, he was co-CEO of Salesforce (which had acquired the company he founded, Quip) and CTO of Facebook. Bret was also one of Google's earliest product managers and co-creator of Google Maps. Before founding Sierra, Clay spent 18 years at Google, where he most recently led Google Labs. Earlier, he started and led Google’s AR/VR effort, Project Starline, and Google Lens. Before that, Clay led the product and design teams for Google Workspace.

Craftsmanship: We get the details right, from the words on the page to the system architecture. We have good taste. When we notice something isn’t right, we take the time to fix it. We are proud of the products we produce. We continuously self-reflect to continuously self-improve.
Intensity: We know we don’t have the luxury of patience. We play to win. We care about our product being the best, and when it isn’t, we fix it. When we fail, we talk about it openly and without blame so we succeed the next time.
Family: We know that balance and intensity are compatible, and we model it in our actions and processes. We are the best technology company for parents. We support and respect each other and celebrate each other’s personal and professional achievements.

Push LLM frontiers: combine large-language models with retrieval, symbolic reasoning, or classic ML; optimize for accuracy, reliability, robustness, latency, and cost.
Measure ruthlessly: Define crisp hypotheses, select fit-for-purpose metrics (incl. human-in-the-loop), run statistically sound studies, and iterate fast.
Publish & open-source: Write high-quality papers, release evaluation suites, and present at NeurIPS/ACL/ICML—or local meet-ups if that's your style.
Seed the future: Maintain a balanced portfolio: near-term product wins, mid-term reliability projects, and ""moon-shot"" research that could 10× our differentiation.
Level-up the team: Lead paper clubs, mentor interns & junior scientists, and model best practices in reproducible science and kind collaboration.


What You'll Bring


PhD (or equivalent depth) in ML, Physics, Math, Engineering, computational linguistics, or a closely related field.
Proven research chops: First-author publications at top venues (NeurIPS, ACL, ICML, EMNLP, etc.).
LLM mastery: experience fine-tuning, prompt-engineering, and augmenting models with external knowledge/tooling.
Experimental rigor: fluent in benchmarking, statistical testing, and clear visualization of complex results.
Production-grade coding: Python + ML stacks (PyTorch/JAX), version control, and comfort reading & contributing to large codebases; bonus for database fluency (Neo4j, Postgres, MongoDB).
Storytelling skills: you can explain a log-probability trick to executives and translate product pain-points into concrete research questions.
Bonus points for: open-source maintainer experience, safety/bias evaluation expertise, or a successful track record of bridging academia and industry.

Experience defining and operationalizing metrics that reflect system performance, resource usage, or efficiency from the ground up
A strong foundation in SQL and Python, and a track record of building models and analyses that drive technical and strategic decisions
Excellent communication skills and the ability to partner effectively with engineers, researchers, and product stakeholders
A strategic mindset that goes beyond statistical testing to surface actionable insights and long-term tradeoffs


You could be an especially great fit if you have:

Comfortable navigating fast-paced execution while also anchoring decisions in long-term impact
Strong programming background, with ability to run simulations and prototype variants
Experience in NLP, large language models, or generative AI

Solutions Engineering At Polar Analytics

Solutions Engineering at Polar Analytics sits at the heart of Tech, Sales and Custome Success. You'll be architecting the semantic layer that transforms raw commerce data into intelligent, actionable insights. As we scale, you'll design proofs of concept that close deals fast, lead implementations that deliver value in weeks, and unlock new use cases that directly feed back into our product roadmap. This isn't just technical problem-solving—it's building the data foundation that helps indie DTC brands compete and grow faster than ever before.

Why This Role?


Own the semantic layer for commerce agents - Build the unified data model that turns raw Shopify, ad, and retention data into the language that AI agents understand, creating consistent metrics and business logic across every store and channel
End-to-end impact from pre-sale to expansion - Design compelling proofs of concept that accelerate our sales cycle, then lead implementations that hit time-to-value in weeks while identifying expansion opportunities
High-leverage, high-ownership environment - Write SQL, architect integrations, and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with revenue leaders where your technical decisions directly impact retention and LTV
Strategic seat at the table - Work at the critical intersection of data, product, and revenue where your insights shape both customer success and product development


What's the Scope?


Drive $1M ARR per quarter - Own the technical close for high-value deals through compelling demonstrations, custom proofs of concept, and seamless technical implementations
Launch successful features monthly - Collaborate with Product to translate customer needs into shipped features, using direct customer feedback to influence roadmap priorities
Build power user networks at top logos - Cultivate deep technical relationships with key stakeholders at enterprise accounts, turning them into advocates and expansion opportunities
Partner with the CS team on deal nurturing - Work closely with Customer Success to identify upsell opportunities, resolve technical challenges, and ensure long-term customer satisfaction


This Job is Made for You If:


You think in systems and code fluently - Strong technical foundation with ability to write SQL, architect integrations, and choose the right technology for each challenge
You thrive on direct customer interaction - Natural ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear business value while turning customer feedback into prioritized development work
You sprint but never ship half-baked - Bias toward action with unwavering commitment to quality, ensuring every implementation meets both timeline and excellence standards
You want strategic influence - Seeking a role where data, product, and revenue decisions intersect, with direct input on company direction and customer success

🚀 Our mission? To help indie DTC brands compete and grow—faster and more profitably.

What Makes Polar Analytics Unique? 💎

🔥 4,000+ Brands and Growing

We’ve scaled to 4,000+ active merchants (Jan 2025) and are on track for 10,000+ this year.

💡 Cutting-edge tech, Built for Simplicity

We leverage the modern data stack to deliver enterprise-level insights—without the need for a data team.

👥 A Team of eCommerce Experts

Our team brings experience from leading eCommerce SaaS platforms, united by a mission to build the next industry leader.

Solutions Engineering At Polar Analytics

Solutions Engineering at Polar Analytics sits at the heart of Tech, Sales and Custome Success. You'll be architecting the semantic layer that transforms raw commerce data into intelligent, actionable insights. As we scale, you'll design proofs of concept that close deals fast, lead implementations that deliver value in weeks, and unlock new use cases that directly feed back into our product roadmap. This isn't just technical problem-solving—it's building the data foundation that helps indie DTC brands compete and grow faster than ever before.

Why This Role?


Own the semantic layer for commerce agents - Build the unified data model that turns raw Shopify, ad, and retention data into the language that AI agents understand, creating consistent metrics and business logic across every store and channel
End-to-end impact from pre-sale to expansion - Design compelling proofs of concept that accelerate our sales cycle, then lead implementations that hit time-to-value in weeks while identifying expansion opportunities
High-leverage, high-ownership environment - Write SQL, architect integrations, and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with revenue leaders where your technical decisions directly impact retention and LTV
Strategic seat at the table - Work at the critical intersection of data, product, and revenue where your insights shape both customer success and product development


What's the Scope?


Drive $1M ARR per quarter - Own the technical close for high-value deals through compelling demonstrations, custom proofs of concept, and seamless technical implementations
Launch successful features monthly - Collaborate with Product to translate customer needs into shipped features, using direct customer feedback to influence roadmap priorities
Build power user networks at top logos - Cultivate deep technical relationships with key stakeholders at enterprise accounts, turning them into advocates and expansion opportunities
Partner with the CS team on deal nurturing - Work closely with Customer Success to identify upsell opportunities, resolve technical challenges, and ensure long-term customer satisfaction


This Job is Made for You If:


You think in systems and code fluently - Strong technical foundation with ability to write SQL, architect integrations, and choose the right technology for each challenge
You thrive on direct customer interaction - Natural ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear business value while turning customer feedback into prioritized development work
You sprint but never ship half-baked - Bias toward action with unwavering commitment to quality, ensuring every implementation meets both timeline and excellence standards
You want strategic influence - Seeking a role where data, product, and revenue decisions intersect, with direct input on company direction and customer success


Our Hiring Process 📝

We believe in a structured, fair, and transparent hiring process. While the steps may vary by role, here’s what you can expect:


Recruiter Screen (30 mins): A call with our Head of Talent to talk through your current/past experience and your motivations and Tell you more about Polar Analytics.
Role Fit Interview (45 mins): Here, you'll meet either the Hiring Manager or a team member of a similar level to discuss your ways of working and understand your skillset and ability for the role.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth




About the opportunity:

Jerry is looking for a data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company, with a focus on optimizing growth channels such as partnerships, marketing, and automation. As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.




Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.




Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).




The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.




I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""




How you will make an impact:

Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency




Preferred experience:

Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python




Who you are:

You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence
