About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics. The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

Based in the heart of Berlin, our collaborative approach offers the opportunity for our clients to acquire 10,000 users daily, providing consistent value and improved ROAS in the short and long term.

We are seeking a Senior Data Scientist to become a central force in optimizing user acquisition, engagement, and revenue for millions of users.

If you are passionate about applying a strong scientific mindset to solve complex business problems, we want to talk to you.

What You’ll Do 🎯


Model and Predict User Value: Lead the development of predictive models, particularly for Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), to identify high-value user segments and drive strategic optimization for marketing and product teams.
Design & Analyze Experiments: Take ownership of the design and analysis of hundreds of A/B tests and observational causal methods to deeply understand user behavior and measure the impact of various strategies across user acquisition, rewards, and in-game tasks.
Drive Strategic Decisions: Partner closely with business leaders, including the CEO and marketing managers, to frame complex business challenges as data problems, translate findings into clear narratives, and influence strategic decision-making.
Holistic Problem-Solving: Engage in a wide range of projects, from improving attribution models and fraud prevention to providing data-driven recommendations for product features and game recommendations.
Deep-Dive Analysis: Utilize exceptional SQL and Python skills to conduct sophisticated data analysis, build robust analytical models, and maintain data structures that support advanced insights and experimentation.

Proven expertise in predictive modeling (especially LTV), user segmentation, and experimentation design (A/B testing and causal methods).
Exceptional proficiency in SQL and Python for complex data manipulation, statistical modeling, and analysis.
Experience collaborating closely with diverse stakeholders—from technical teams (engineers) to business leaders—to drive measurable business impact.
A strong business acumen and the ability to simplify complex data requests into meaningful, actionable solutions.


What Makes You a Great Fit 🌟


A Scientific Mindset: You are not just running queries; you apply a strong statistical mindset and scientific rigor to every problem to ensure the integrity of our insights.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)

Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.




Who we're looking for

We are looking for a highly motivated Data Scientist, who is keen on building advanced predictive models and joining our growing Core Pricing team. The mission is to build a world-class Data Science team that turns ideas and resolves complex challenges into production-grade pricing and risk models effectively, safely, and consistently.




What you’ll do

Explore & analyse large telematics, policy and quote datasets to uncover trends and opportunities
Build and validate statistical & machine learning models that power pricing and risk selection
Collaborate with Engineering, Actuarial and Product to frame business problems and productionise models
Communicate insights clearly through dashboards, visualisations and storytelling
Contribute to best practice in code review, experimentation and shaping our ways of working as you grow




What you’ll bring

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Data Science or related field
Experience: At least 3 years of proven experience as a Data Scientist
Python Proficiency: Strong Python programming skills, with experience in training predictive models. Familiarity with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
SQL: Proficient in SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Statistical Methodology: In-depth knowledge of GLMs and other machine learning algorithms
Data Tools: Familiarity with cloud-based data platforms (we’re on AWS) and data visualisation tools (Looker, matplotlib, seaborn)
Software Engineering:
Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) and software development best practices in a data-intensive environment
Care about documentation and reproducibility
Curiosity and a problem-solving mindset
Excellent communication skills, with a proven ability to present complex information in a clear, accessible way




Nice to have (but not essential)

Experience with CI/CD pipelines (we use buildkite and argoCD)
Hands-on experience with insurance pricing tools like Akur8, Emblem or similar pricing modelling tools
Exposure to telematics or usage-based insurance data
Experience with time series analysis and/or graph technologies




What’s it like to work at Zego?

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things.

We’re spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We’re proud of our company and our culture – a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

Together, we’re setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There’s loads of room to learn and grow, and you’ll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you want.

You’ll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren’t afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we’re making insurance matter.




How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid.

Our hybrid way of working is unique. We don't mandate fixed office days. Instead, we foster a flexible approach that empowers every Zegon to perform at their best. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. You have the flexibility to choose the day that works best for you and your team. We cover the costs for all company-wide events (3 per year), and also provide a separate hybrid contribution to help pay towards other travel costs. We think it’s a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.




Our approach to AI

We believe in the power of AI to meaningfully improve how we work - helping us move faster, think differently, and focus on what matters most. At Zego, we encourage people to stay curious and intentional about how AI is leveraged in their work and teams to drive practical impact every day. This is your chance to do the most meaningful work of your career - and we’ll provide you with the tools, support, and freedom to do it well.




Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you’ll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. We also offer an annual flexible hybrid working contribution, which you can use to support with your travel to the office or towards your own personal development. And that’s just for starters.




We’re an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. The scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Why Deliveroo

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.

We build financial products that accelerate the economic freedom for people who move across borders. We started with car insurance — insuring over a million drivers — and we’re scaling beyond. Tens of millions of people move countries each year, facing overlooked financial challenges. Our future is in building financial products around their needs to positively impact their lives.

How We Work

We’re really proud of the culture we’ve created. We push for progress every day, because we know that we’ll only hit big milestones by taking lots of smaller steps. We’re always open to helping our team mates, sharing our ideas, experience and knowledge to solve problems together. We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer’s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.

And autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction. That’s why we collaborate to do in-depth planning twice a year, and make sure we leave with clear goals and objectives that flow from top to bottom. To make sure we’re as aligned as possible across functions, most of our work rolls up into three tribes; Acquisition, Retention & Claims. Each tribe has multiple teams embedded in it, working cross-functionally to do great work.

We’re so excited for all of the challenges up ahead, and we need more people to help us tackle them! If life at Marshmallow sounds like it could be for you, explore our Culture Handbook to find out more.

About Us 🚗

Marshmallow aims to make insurance more accessible and more affordable for as many people as possible 💸. That means harnessing technology, automation and intelligent decision making to serve customers better and cheaper than traditional insurers .

We’re here to generate insights and actions from all the data we can get our hands on. This includes analytics, predictive modelling, and prescriptive recommendations. We deliver high impact work to the business, focusing on high risk, high reward projects, and making sure all decisions are data driven.

We’re now looking for a Data Scientist to join our Claims Tribe, where we are on a mission to transform how we handle claims by using data and AI to make faster and smarter decisions that improve outcomes and reduce costs 🎯.

This is a critical area of the business that directly affects our loss ratio, operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. You will build intelligent systems that help us solve the right claims at the right time for the right cost by combining predictive models, agentic AI workflows and automation to guide and accelerate decisions across the claim lifecycle. That includes decisioning models, fraud detection, prioritisation and workflow logic.

There are high impact problems to solve, and you will be part of a team that is actively redefining what great looks like in claims handling through the use of frontier AI tools and human in the loop systems.

What You’ll Be Doing 💻


Owning and delivering data science solutions that improve how we triage, prioritise and resolve claims with measurable impact on cost, speed and customer experience.
Building and deploying predictive models that support automated decisions or enable better human ones (e.g. risk triage, fraud signals, case prioritisation, exception handling).
Collaborating with engineers, product managers and claims experts to embed your models into our internal systems and tools.
Supporting an experimentation-first mindset with A/B tests and analytics to prove business value.
Contributing to the definition of KPIs and analytical processes that help us evaluate and continuously improve claims performance.
Exploring opportunities to apply emerging AI technologies such as agentic systems and large language models to streamline workflows and assist decision makers in real time.


Who You Are 💪


You are naturally curious and hands-on, all things data and ML related.
You have a commercial mindset and focus on driving meaningful business impact.
You communicate clearly across both technical and non-technical teams.
You care about the customer journey and want to make hard moments easier.
You’re pragmatic and outcome-oriented, not wedded to complexity for its own sake.
You enjoy solving real operational problems with cutting edge tools, especially where human judgment and automation intersect.
You value simplicity, clarity, and strong data foundations.


What We're Looking For From You 🔎

Experiences that are essential 🔝


Experience building and deploying ML models that deliver measurable business results.
Understanding of how to evaluate performance within risk decisioning, including performance trade-offs and operational considerations.
Familiarity with A/B testing and measuring model impact.
Proficiency in Python and SQL.

          <strong>About Marshmallow<br><br></strong>We build financial products that accelerate the economic freedom for people who move across borders. We started with car insurance — insuring over a million drivers — and we’re scaling beyond. Tens of millions of people move countries each year, facing overlooked financial challenges. Our future is in building financial products around their needs to positively impact their lives.<br><br><strong>How We Work<br><br></strong>We’re really proud of the culture we’ve created. We push for progress every day, because we know that we’ll only hit big milestones by taking lots of smaller steps. We’re always open to helping our team mates, sharing our ideas, experience and knowledge to solve problems together. We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer’s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.<br><br>And autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction. That’s why we collaborate to do in-depth planning twice a year, and make sure we leave with clear goals and objectives that flow from top to bottom. To make sure we’re as aligned as possible across functions, most of our work rolls up into three tribes; Acquisition, Retention &amp; Claims. Each tribe has multiple teams embedded in it, working cross-functionally to do great work.<br><br>We’re so excited for all of the challenges up ahead, and we need more people to help us tackle them!

About Navys




At Navys, we are building the most advanced funds lawyer, ever.




Navys is transforming the fund formation process by combining deep legal expertise with AI. This isn’t another contract review or document summarizer: we are creating the Legal Operating System for funds.




Navys fuses internal legal precision and external regulatory insight into a living system that learns, reasons, and scales with fund professionals.




We are seeking an ambitious Data Scientist to join our team on a full-time basis. This is a unique chance to work alongside experienced private funds lawyers, AI engineers, and innovators in a tech-forward environment. Navys is not just a better tool - it’s a different model of how legal software should be built. You’ll be working on a product that completely reshapes the legal industry.




As our first or one of our first data science hires, you’ll play a foundational role in building AI-driven legal intelligence systems, from data ingestion and modelling through to experimentation and deployment. You’ll work closely with engineering, product, and legal teams to design models and pipelines that power our platform.




What you’ll own (first 12 months)




Design, train, and evaluate machine learning models for legal and regulatory intelligence.
Build robust data pipelines for ingesting, cleaning, and structuring complex legal data.
Collaborate with software engineers to integrate models into production systems.
Partner with legal experts to translate domain knowledge into data features and model architectures.
Develop and maintain model monitoring, evaluation, and retraining workflows.
Contribute to the design of our AI/ML stack and establish best practices for data science across the company.

Familiarity with cloud-based ML services (Azure preferred; AWS acceptable).
Experience working with APIs, databases, and structured/unstructured datasets.
Excellent problem-solving, analytical, and communication skills.
Desire to work in a fast-paced, dynamic start-up environment and a go-getter attitude.




Nice-to-have extras




Experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
Knowledge of Azure AI services (e.g., Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Search).
Background in legal tech, fintech, or another highly regulated domain.
Familiarity with MLOps tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases, Kubeflow).
Understanding of vector databases and semantic search.
Experience with data visualisation libraries (e.g., Plotly, D3.js).






You’ll thrive here if




You are talented, focused, and aligned with our mission - we are building a complex product with innovative technology, so we need driven and dynamic candidates who can rise to the challenge.
You take ownership of problems and run with them—figuring things out with limited direction when needed.
You are a strong communicator who gets your point across clearly, and you’re not afraid to speak up when something needs addressing.
You are independent, flexible, and prepared to take on responsibility early on.
You are prepared to be accountable for—and proud of—the work you do and your contributions to the team.




What we offer




Work with a veteran team of ex-employees of leading law firms, tech companies, and AI labs.
Direct mentorship from senior engineers, private funds lawyers, and product leaders.

Communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical partners, ensuring insights drive measurable outcomes.
Grow your expertise in modern ML approaches (transformers, representation learning, sequence-to-sequence modelling) through high-visibility projects.


What we're looking for:

You’re curious, analytical, and eager to grow your skills in a commercial data science environment. You bring strong fundamentals in modelling and data manipulation, and you’re motivated by the challenge of applying these to impactful business problems.


Strong analytical and critical thinking skills, with a passion for understanding customer behaviour and enabling data-driven growth.
Practical experience with predictive modelling, such as churn, propensity, segmentation, or value modelling.
Proficiency in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries.
Ability to work with large datasets to uncover actionable insights that influence marketing, engagement, or retention strategies.
Interest or early experience in deep learning approaches — such as transformers, embeddings, or sequence models — with motivation to learn and apply them.
A collaborative attitude, with the ability to work in cross-functional teams.
A strong academic background (typically with a Master’s in a technical or mathematical field) or equivalent professional experience.


Nice to Have:


Experience with A/B testing or experimentation frameworks.
Familiarity with workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow), feature stores, or visualisation platforms (e.g., Tableau, Domo).
Exposure to gaming, e-commerce, or subscription-based business models.
Proven experience of analysing and modelling with “big data” technologies.
A personal interest in gaming and entertainment.

Who We're Looking For

As a Data Scientist in Delivery, you are a problem solver and builder who is passionate about creating practical solutions that enable customers to make better engineering decisions. You are someone who can grasp advanced engineering concepts across multiple industries, and you excel at working directly with customers (and often side-by-side with them on-site) to transform cutting edge AI models into tools that are useful and used.




You’ve worked on difficult problems that require strong foundations in data driven modelling and deep learning techniques, with hands-on experience in probabilistic methods and predictive modelling. Expertise in python, along with proficiency in libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, TensorFlow and PyTorch, is essential, with the ability to deploy scalable, production-ready models and data pipelines.




With at least 1 year industry experience (post Masters or PhD) in a commercial, non-research environment, you’re ready to hit the ground running. You’re truly excited about growing your technical expertise and are naturally inclined to take ownership of data science work streams, continuously improving the systems and solutions you work on to ensure they are practical, impactful and meet the evolving needs of our customers.




This Role

In this role, you’ll work closely with our Simulation Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, and customers to understand and define the engineering and physics challenges we are solving.

You’ll build the foundations for successful, impactful solutions by:

Developing and utilizing innovative deep learning models in combination with state-of-the-art optimization methods to predict and control the behaviour of physical systems.
Taking full responsibility for the quality, accuracy and impact of your work.
Designing, building and testing data pipelines that are reliable, scalable and easily deployable in production environments.
Working closely with simulation engineers to ensure seamless integration of data science models with simulations.
Contributing to internal R&D and product development, helping to refine models and identify new areas of application.
Engaging in open communication and presentation with both technical teams and customers, helping onboard users and co-develop with customers.
There is a requirement to travel to customer sites in North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, an average of 2-3 weeks per quarter, where you’ll collaborate closely with customers to build solutions on site.




As the role evolves, there are exciting opportunities for growth as an individual contributor or a technical lead, especially if you’re driven by taking ownership of more complex projects and leading the direction of future solutions.

Please note, this role is based in London, working 2-3 days per week in our central office.

We are looking for an experienced Machine Learning Engineer who can help us advance our automatic speech recognition (ASR) engines for Flow, our new Conversational AI companion and create interactive voice interfaces of the future that ‘Understand Every Voice’.

We are betting big on scaling models, so you will be working with millions of hours of audio and billion parameter models which train across dozens of GPUs. It’s all about finding bottlenecks across our 50+ languages.

Our main research focuses are large-scale self-supervised learning, building state-of-the-art speech pipelines and breaking ground on our own emotive text-to-speech (TTS) models.

What You'll Be Doing


Working with a diverse group of engineers across Speechmatics.
Scaling self-supervised learning models across hundreds of GPUs in the cloud.
Experimenting with distillation or quantisation to speed up our models at runtime.
Comparing compute efficiencies of architectures such as a transformer and the impact on WER.
Developing new, state-of-the-art AI features, from training models, all the way to shipping it to production.
Advancing end-to-end speech models and researching new approaches to TTS.


We aim to get you onboarded and started on projects in your first few days. In addition, having a very collaborative culture, you will often be pair programming with a colleague on streamlining our production ML pipelines, reviewing other folks’ code and suggesting new ways to tackle a tough real time factor (RTF) optimisation problem, as well as brainstorming novel approaches for analysing model predictions with the team.

You’ll want to join our team if you


Ambitious Engineers keen to work on bleeding-edge speech recognition and representational learning.
Experience owning areas of code, seeking alignment rather than guidance.
Proven-track record of delivering results, moving fast and keeping things simple.
Someone who loves working in collaborative and diverse teams.
Has a growth mindset and loves to develop oneself and others.
Enjoys solving challenging problems and optimising a stack of unfamiliar code.


We encourage you to apply even if you do not feel you match all of the requirements exactly. The list of requirements is intended to show the kinds of experience and qualities we’re looking for, but it is not exhaustive. If you are interested in the role, the team, and our mission, we would love to consider your application. We are always open to conversations and look forward to hearing from you.

We have structured a hybrid approach that includes 2-3 designated office days each week. This arrangement ensures that while we embrace the advantages of remote work, we also maintain the vital connection and synergy that only in-person interactions can foster.

This is only the beginning; we’re looking for amazing people like you to continue our journey…

What We Can Offer You

No matter what stage of your career you’re at - from paid internships and first-job opportunities through to management and senior positions - we’ll support you with the training and development needed to reach your career aspirations with us. There really is no shortage of opportunities here for you to get involved and collaborate with those around you to deliver your best work.

We offer incredibly flexible working, regular company lunches, and birthday celebrations. But that’s not all. We’ve spoken to our teams to find out what they want. From Private Medical, and Dental for you and your family, through to global working opportunities, a generous holiday allowance and pension/401K matching, we want to make sure our employees and their families are looked after. Every employee will receive a working from home allowance for tech or home office equipment (on top of your choice of laptop and accessories of course). Our approach to parental leave is designed to support employees globally. While this varies by geo, we have support in place for parents (including adoption assistance and reproductive health services) to ensure they have the time and financial resources needed to care for their growing families.

At Speechmatics, our mission is simple: Understand Every Voice out there.

That's not just about our tech – it's the heart and soul of who we are. We welcome different experiences, viewpoints, and identities. For us, it’s not just the right thing to do; it’s our catalyst for sparking innovation and creativity. Our teams thrive in an environment that celebrates and supports everyone – no matter their gender, identity or expression, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion, belief, marital status, national origin, veteran status, pregnancy, or maternity status.

But we don’t just open the door to diversity – we actively welcome it. Why? Because we believe every unique voice adds something special to our team, leading us to smarter solutions and a better workplace.

So, come as you are and join our Speechling community. We’re building a place where every voice not only gets heard but is also respected and valued.

This team is building LLM-powered systems that think, reason, and act, helping 60,000+ engineers and technologists automate complex workflows, accelerate delivery, and eliminate friction. This isn’t chatbot work. This is AI with real-world agency—deployed into live production environments where milliseconds and precision matter.




What You’ll Be Doing (Day 1 to Day 100)




Design & Build AI Agents: You’ll architect and implement autonomous systems powered by LLMs that execute multi-step tasks inside highly complex and regulated software environments.
Bridge Research & Production: Experiment with techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), embeddings, prompt chaining, and fine-tuning, and turn them into robust, production-grade tools.
Own the ML Lifecycle: From experimentation to live deployment—write, test, scale, and monitor Python-based ML systems with tight performance and latency requirements.
Scale Impact Across the Organisation: Your work will directly affect thousands of engineers by eliminating cognitive bottlenecks, streamlining access to knowledge, and enabling AI-assisted development workflows.
Push What’s Possible with LLMs: You’ll go beyond the basics—embedding agent memory, reasoning over tools and environments, integrating external APIs, and helping models adapt over time.




Why This Role Is Career-Defining




True Autonomy in AI: This is one of the few places globally where you'll work on agentic AI with live deployment at this scale. Your ideas won’t die in a research doc—they’ll become production systems used every day, directly impacting the global economy.

Unparalleled Impact: This isn’t a niche project. Your work will directly affect 60,000+ developers and engineers, streamlining how they work, build, and deliver inside a massive, global institution.

Elite Team, Elite Tools: Join a curated squad of top-tier ML engineers, AI researchers, and systems architects with executive buy-in, enterprise resources, and a mandate to experiment, deliver, and scale.

No Legacy Constraints: While you’ll be inside a bank, you won’t be trapped in legacy tech. This team works with modern tooling, top-tier hardware, and the freedom to build right—from the ground up - a start up environment with all the financial backing.

The Opportunity to Go Permanent: This isn’t just a contract gig—it’s a launchpad. The organisation is open to making this a permanent position (optional) for those who thrive and want to continue at the bleeding edge.




Your Toolkit & Ecosystem:




Languages: Python (essential), plus Java or C++ (helpful)
LLMs: GPT, Claude, LLaMA, open-source models, fine-tuned variants
Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, Transformers, HuggingFace
Infra: AWS (SageMaker, EKS), Kubernetes, Docker, GitOps CI/CD
MLOps: Ray, MLFlow, distributed training, GPU scheduling, A/B testing
Techniques: Prompt engineering, RAG, few-shot learning, embeddings, agent planning and reasoning, graph-based methods




What You Bring to the Table:




MSc or PhD in Computer Science, Machine Learning, AI, or a closely related field.
Hands-on experience with production-grade ML/AI, especially in NLP or Generative AI domains.
Deep understanding of LLM architecture and behaviour, from prompt engineering to inference optimisation.
You’ve built real-world systems using embeddings, fine-tuning, or inference-serving pipelines at scale.
You’re highly autonomous—able to drive projects from scratch in ambiguous problem spaces.
You’re performance-conscious—able to optimise for speed, cost, and accuracy in demanding environments.
You care deeply about usability, transparency, and responsible deployment.




Bonus Experience That’ll Make You Stand Out:




Experience building agent-based architectures or intelligent orchestration layers.
Familiarity with agent memory/state management, recursive reasoning, or tool use in LLMs.
Exposure to graph neural networks, recommender systems, or structured search/retrieval.
Experience with multi-agent systems, workflow orchestration, or simulation environments.
Experience in fast-paced product environments (e.g., Big Tech, AI-first start-ups, R&D labs).




Who This Role Is For:




This is ideal for someone who’s:

Built or contributed to real-world LLM or agent-based systems.
Hungry to move fast, solve hard problems, and see their work go live.
Looking for purpose, scale, and technical depth—all in one role.
Eager to work on the next frontier of enterprise AI—not just talk about it.




If you’re looking for more than just another ML job—if you want to create intelligent systems that act, learn, and scale—we want to speak with you.

We’re looking for an enthusiastic Data Scientist to join our Data team and play a pivotal role in shaping how we leverage data at Urban Jungle.




This is an exciting opportunity to work in a high-growth tech scaleup, making an impact on core business decisions and customer experiences from day one.




You’ll collaborate with our Product, Engineering, and Commercial teams to build predictive models and data-driven solutions that power everything from eligibility checks to fraud detection, pricing, and beyond.




Here's what you'll get up to:

Get to grips with our data platform and begin contributing to models that power core business decisions.
Work on projects that span multiple areas, including pricing, risk assessment, and behavioural fraud detection.
Build, deploy, and iterate on data models that bring clear and measurable value to our business.
Collaborate with Engineering, Product, and Commercial teams to deliver data-driven products that delight our customers and drive business growth.
Play a key role in developing our state-of-the-art data platform, setting the standard for best practices in data science and analytics.

1+ years of experience in data science (or equivalent academic or personal projects).
A problem-solver who enjoys thinking creatively about how data can deliver value.
A passion for building great data products and a willingness to roll up your sleeves across the data lifecycle – from pipelining to model deployment.
Experience with some of the following tools and technologies (or an eagerness to learn):
Python and its data science ecosystem (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch).
Statistical methods and machine learning (e.g., A/B testing, model validation).
Data pipelining tools like SQL, dbt, BigQuery, or Spark.
A strong communicator with the ability to communicate technical concepts into layman’s terms for a non-technical audience.
You’re not afraid to challenge the status quo if it means reaching a better outcome for our customers.
Use your excellent time management abilities to prioritise daily tasks in accordance with overarching company goals.
You’re ambitious, and eager to progress quickly to grow alongside the company.
You apply yourself to everything you do, recognising the difference that makes to the business.
You treat everyone with integrity, respect and kindness - whether it’s your colleagues, our customers, or our partners.
You’ll be a champion of our values, and encourage others to be the same.




These requirements are a guide as to what we’re looking for, but if you don’t have all of the skills listed above, that’s okay! Please don’t let that hold you back from applying if the role excites you.

A Clear Plan. We’ll give you the clarity on what we want to achieve, with the freedom and autonomy for you to decide how we get there.
The Best People. You’ll be surrounded by teammates who are exceptional at what they do, whilst being kind, honest people who champion our values.
A dedicated development budget, access to a senior mentor, and training on whatever you need to do your job well.

CSC Generation is on a mission to build the most advanced AI-driven retail operating system in the industry. Our brands—including Sur La Table, One Kings Lane, and Backcountry—rely on fast, intelligent decision-making rooted in high-integrity data.

We’re hiring an AI-First Data Scientist who combines deep statistical and machine learning expertise with modern MLOps tooling and automation instincts. You will design and deploy production-ready ML solutions, leveraging cutting-edge platforms like AWS Sagemaker, Vertiv, and advanced causal inference techniques such as Double Machine Learning (DML). Your work will not just inform decisions—it will automate, scale, and embed intelligence directly into our operating systems.

This is a highly technical, hands-on role with direct business impact. You’ll be embedded with senior operators and report directly to a brand CEO or platform leader, supporting mission-critical decisions and creating AI systems that improve themselves over time.




What You Get to Do Every Day

Lead the end‑to‑end ML lifecycle—from problem framing and data preparation through model training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
Build reliable data pipelines and features; ensure data quality, reproducibility, documentation, and auditability, on cloud-native platforms (e.g. AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI)
Develop predictive and causal models; design experiments to quantify impact and guide decision‑making.
Apply modern MLOps practices (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, CI/CD, observability) to keep models robust and maintainable.
Translate model outputs into clear recommendations; partner with stakeholders to drive adoption and iterate based on results.
Collaborate with engineering and product on secure integration, performance, and cost‑efficiency.
Continuously research and apply emerging techniques in AI, including generative AI, automated feature engineering, and reinforcement learning.




What You Bring to the Role

5+ years’ experience in applied data science/ML with a track record of deploying models to production.
Bachelor’s or Master’s in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, or related quantitative field.
Proficiency in Python and SQL; strong software engineering practices (version control, testing, reproducibility).
Experience with cloud‑based ML workflows and processing data at scale.
Familiarity with MLOps concepts (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, automated deployment, CI/CD).
Experience across predictive, time‑series, and causal modeling; ability to design experiments, A/B testing, and interpret impact.
Excellent communication: able to present complex work to non‑technical stakeholders and drive action.
Curiosity and a bias for building autonomous, decision‑supporting systems.




Why This Role is Different

Most data scientist roles focus on building models that live in notebooks. This one takes those models all the way to production—where they shape decisions in real time.

You won’t just be running experiments—you’ll be building the future of how our business thinks and operates. You’ll integrate AI directly into decision loops, create reusable data science products, and champion a culture of AI-first thinking across the organization.




What’s in it for you? Joining CSC Generation isn’t just about having a seat at the table—it’s about helping redesign the table entirely. You’ll be challenged, stretched, and supported as you grow faster than you thought possible. In addition to competitive compensation, we offer:

Executive Access: Work directly with brand CEOs and senior leadership, solving real business problems and earning mentorship from top operators.
AI-First Skill Building: Get hands-on with the most advanced AI tools in the market. From automation to prompt engineering, you’ll build a modern tech stack that sets you apart in any industry.
Accelerated Career Path: High performers are quickly entrusted with greater responsibility, new challenges, and leadership opportunities across our portfolio of brands.
Competitive benefits: Paid time off policies, 401(k)/RRSP match, medical/dental/vision and a variety of supplemental policies, and employee discounts at our portfolio companies

What our interview process looks like:

📞 Step 1: If you align with our vision and meet the qualifications, we’ll reach out to schedule a conversation and introduce CSC.
🧠 Step 2: You’ll complete a short AI or product-building challenge so we can understand how you approach problems and execution.
💬 Step 3: Participate in deep-dive interviews with CSC leadership focused on your experience, product mindset, and operational thinking.
📩 Step 4: Offer. We’ll move fast for the right candidate.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


PhD + 3 years, MS/MA + 6 years or BS/BA 8 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About You

If you’re an engineer who loves building product, has an ownership mentality and is someone who constantly wants to learn and evolve, here are a few reasons why you might be excited to join Salt Media:

You won’t be pigeonholed into a narrow engineering role. Instead, you’ll tackle a variety of challenges, on a variety of products, from improving backend architectures and optimizing models to experimenting with new tools and frameworks. Your work will make an immediate, visible difference to clients and the company’s trajectory.
Autonomy and Ownership
Rather than waiting for permission, you’ll propose solutions, influence product direction, and shape development processes. Our flat org structure eliminates red tape and encourages direct communication. If you see an opportunity to build something better, you run with it.
Exposure to the Entire Business
At Salt Media, you won’t be isolated in your own technical corner. You’ll collaborate closely with product leaders, data scientists, client-facing teams, and even the CEO. This cross-functional exposure expands your understanding of the product and customers, helping you hone both technical and business skills.
Fast-Paced Growth and Learning
Ad tech is evolving quickly, and we move with it. That means constant learning, continuous improvement, and never feeling stuck in outdated tech stacks or stale processes. As the company grows, so do your opportunities—new responsibilities, new projects, and a larger platform to showcase your talents.
A Culture of Curiosity and Transparency
Expect open communication, direct feedback, and a culture that values curiosity and problem solving over rigid hierarchies. You’ll join a team that encourages questions, celebrates breakthroughs, and is genuinely excited about building product to shake up a traditional industry.

Role Overview

At Workday, it all began with a conversation over breakfast. When our founders met at a sunny California diner, they came up with an idea to revolutionize the enterprise software market. And when we began to rise, one thing that really set us apart was our culture. A culture which was driven by our value of putting our people first. And ever since, the happiness, development, and contribution of every Workmate is central to who we are.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

As a leading advanced analytics consulting firm, we help Fortune 500 companies generate valuable insights from their data. With our deep expertise in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI, we deliver innovative solutions to complex business problems. As a Lead Data Scientist at Tiger Analytics, you will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and drive business value through advanced analytics.

Key Responsibilities:


Accelerate and improve the entire network design process, from raw data to a model ready for running in tools like Coupa or Llamasoft
This involves: Getting data and identifying/correcting outliers in capacity, throughputs, and transportation costs
Creating models for auto-completion of missing data and new routes
Automating the creation of common scenarios, such as optimizing warehouse locations (deleting or adding warehouses) in a dynamic and globally applicable way
Connecting multiple isolated models- The core of this involves mathematical optimization models (mixed-integer linear programming)
Combine data science with supply chain knowledge to adapt to available data
Develop heuristics to accelerate NP-hard network design models that currently take days to run
The goal is to automate the running of hundreds of models in the background to provide possible improvements without manual intervention
Supply Chain Analysis:
Normalize historical data (3-5 years) to reflect the supply chain accurately, removing anomalies like strikes
Identify when and why the real supply chain deviates from the plan (root cause analysis)
Analyze bottlenecks in the supply chain
Find ""general insights"" that analysts might not know to look for, such as unexpected correlations between events across different parts of the supply chain (e.g., promotions in Luxembourg causing stockouts in Spain). This requires creative thinking beyond simple correlation due to the complexity and temporal aspects of the global supply chain
Identify trends where things are operating outside of normal parameters for any KPI or action in the supply chain


Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field
7+ years of experience in Data Science and Machine Learning
7+ years of hands-on experience in Python and PySpark
Strong stakeholder management skills, including engagement with business units and vendors
Data Science: Strong expertise in developing supervised and unsupervised ML models, with knowledge of time series and demand forecasting being a plus

We’re a spatial intelligence platform that tracks occupancy and usage patterns, analyzes how spaces are used, and turns those insights into better decisions.




We’re hiring an Intermediate Data Scientist who loves building algorithms more than plumbing pipelines. You’ll work end-to-end in a small, mighty team, using Azure Databricks with PySpark and Delta Lake, publishing to Snowflake. Our work is batch-first with streaming awareness, privacy-conscious by design, and all about turning messy spatiotemporal data into clear, actionable signals.




What you’ll do

Design, build, and ship algorithms that extract signal from noisy indoor movement and occupancy data.
Frame problems, invent features and heuristics, and benchmark approaches with clear baselines and metrics.
Build scalable data processing jobs in PySpark or an equivalent big-data framework, and publish results to Snowflake.
Partner with engineers and stakeholders to translate findings into product and customer outcomes.
Monitor models in the wild: quality checks, drift detection, and pragmatic iteration.
Contribute to data quality remediation at scale and help us choose system architectures that fit the algorithms’ needs.




What you’ll bring

Canada-based and legally able to work in Canada.
2–5 years in DS or ML with evidence of building or significantly modifying algorithms, not just applying defaults.
Strong Python and SQL on large datasets.
Hands-on big-data processing experience such as PySpark, Spark on EMR or Dataproc, Flink, or Dask. Databricks, Snowflake, and Delta Lake are strong pluses.
Clear, concise communication with non-technical partners, and comfort owning work end-to-end in a small team.
Extra points for experience with streaming data, sensor or spatiotemporal analysis, trajectory analysis, Bayesian methods, or spatial data.




How we work

Explorers thrive here. We often chase answers that may not exist yet. You won’t need hand-holding, and you’ll be comfortable being wrong on the way to being right. If you love untangling complexity, living in code, and shipping elegant solutions, you’ll feel at home.




You’ll join a remote-first team in Canada, where end-to-end ownership is the norm and thoughtful engineering beats shiny dashboards. We value small teams, clear decisions, and evidence over buzzwords.




Tech you’ll use

Azure Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake
Snowflake
Python, SQL
Plus the right tools for robust benchmarking, monitoring, and data quality




Perks and benefits

Competitive compensation with equity
Remote-first in Canada
Every long weekend is four days long
Inclusive, accessible hiring process and workplace
Equal opportunity employer




Our hiring process

15-minute phone screen focused on mutual fit.
Practical technical exercise aligned with our real-world problems
Team conversation to talk through trade-offs, baselines, and how you’ve shipped in production.




Ready to explore?

If you’ve designed custom features or heuristics, created non-default objectives or decision rules, built benchmarking frameworks, or authored core inference logic, we want to talk. Send us your resume and a short note about one algorithm you’re proud of — what you tried, what you measured, and why it won.




Currently, we are only able to consider applicants who are legally allowed to work in Canada.

We are committed to providing a barrier-free work environment in concert with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act and the Ontario Human Rights Code. As such, we will make accommodations available to applicants with disabilities upon request during the recruitment process.

Your models don't just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you, read on.

AlgaeCal is on the hunt for an Intermediate Data Scientist to develop mathematical algorithms and apply machine learning to analyze business data, test hypotheses, and turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.

This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we're driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world's only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you'll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.

This job might be for you if you've got...


2+ years experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You've built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don't just analyze numbers, you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You've used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that'll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis
Kaggle-level knowledge of artificial intelligence models. And if you think RAG is something you clean your countertops with, this probably isn't the role for you.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it's regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don't just apply models, you understand how they work under the hood
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You've worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You're the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don't just crunch numbers, you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You're proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability
Industry know-how that adds value. If you've got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that's a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI


Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you're nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can't wait to meet you.

Other Qualities You'll Need

You're humble—you put the team and others' needs ahead of your own
You're hungry to learn more
You're people smart--in the sense that you're a great teammate


The truth is, if you don't have these qualities you won't last long at AlgaeCal. So if you're missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.

What Will You Earn?

Our Intermediate Data Scientist position starts at $75,000 and can go up to $90,000 depending on your experience. If your salary expectations differ from this range, let us know! We are open to discussing compensation that matches your unique skill set.

You'll also enjoy the following benefits:


Monthly team events and activities
Flexible Stat Holidays with the option to bank days for later use
Weekly team lunches
Casual dress code
Incredible dog friendly, Yaletown office one block from SkyTrain
Remote working is okay with us too


And above all, you'll join a team that you'll never want to leave. Culture is everything to us. Yes, we work extremely hard to change as many people's lives as possible. But we know how to have fun and reward ourselves too.

Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.




Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. For over five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck, Rakovina Therapeutics, and ImmVue Therapeutics.




You will help identify, clean, prepare, and test datasets; run experiments to evaluate new architectures and tune hyperparameters; continually improve the robustness and efficiency of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. In this process, you will have the opportunity to build your skills by collaborating with our team of accomplished ML scientists and chemists. Software engineering expertise is required, as well as experience with deep learning and generative models; knowledge of chemistry and pharmacology is preferred be not required.




Here is the background we’re looking for:

M.S. (Ph.D. preferred) in CS, applied mathematics, statistics, physics, or related discipline;
Experience with machine learning techniques, including diffusion models, Transformers, and Bayesian optimization, preferably demonstrated through peer-reviewed publications;
Two or more years’ experience developing robust code on larger projects, including code review, refactoring, unit testing, version control, etc.;
Mastery of Python and PyTorch;
Strong background in chemistry or pharmacology; and

          <p>Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most exciting open problems in machine learning. Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.</p><p><br></p><p>Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence.

Partner with a business-oriented co-founder to launch a new AI-native company
Own all technical architecture, infrastructure, and implementation decisions
Build from zero to one, MVP, iterations, integrations, and full-stack deployment
Create defensibility through smart use of AI, automation, and infrastructure
Potentially earn significant equity and long-term ownership in a venture


🧠 What You Bring


Strong experience with LLMs (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, open-source models) and prompt engineering
Experience building and maintaining production-grade AI systems
Proficiency in Python, JS/TS, or similar, with the ability to build and deploy full workflows
Familiarity with APIs, webhooks, vector databases, and automation platforms (Zapier, LangChain, etc.)
Ability to work independently, switch contexts, and move quickly without much oversight
Clear technical communication and systematic thinking


Preferred Qualifications


Experience in startup environments, AI tooling, or no-code/low-code stack integrations
Prior experience launching AI-powered products or tools
Familiarity with frameworks like Lang Graph, Pinecone, LlamaIndex, or RAG architectures
Strong intuition for product and user experience


💡 You're a Great Fit If You…


Ship real tools, not just demos
Can own an entire product or subsystem on your own
Love solving messy problems with clean code and smart automations
Thrive in ambiguity, move fast, and never wait to be told what to do
Are open to both career tracks: operator or co-founder
Are hungry for more than a job, you want a mission


🌄 Why Kelowna? Why Now?

Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.

What You Should Already Have:

Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.




What We Will Give You:

Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.




About the Role:




We're seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to bridge the gap between our data products, data science insights and production systems. You'll be responsible for taking ML models from concept to production, building robust MLOps infrastructure, and ensuring our machine learning systems operate reliably at scale. This role focuses on the engineering aspects of ML design, deployment, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure.




What you will do:




Design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion to model serving
Build automated model training, validation, and deployment workflows using CI/CD best practices
Develop and maintain MLOps infrastructure for model versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment
Create robust monitoring and alerting systems for model performance, data drift, and system health
Optimize model inference performance and cost for production workloads
Collaborate with our Data Engineers to design and implement feature stores and feature pipelines
Develop automated data quality checks and validation frameworks for ML pipelines
Build scalable feature engineering workflows that support both batch and real-time inference
Implement data versioning and lineage tracking for reproducible ML workflows
Partner with Software Data Scientists to productionize research models and experiments
Implement frameworks for model evaluation and gradual rollouts
Design automated retraining pipelines and model refresh strategies
Establish best practices for model governance, documentation, and compliance
Work closely with Software Engineers to integrate ML capabilities into existing applications
Contribute to architectural decisions for scalable, maintainable ML systems
Participate in code reviews, documentation, and knowledge sharing across teams
Mentor junior engineers on ML engineering best practices




The right person for this role will have:




3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, MLOps, or related fields
Strong proficiency in Python for ML development and automation
Solid SQL skills for data manipulation and analysis
Hands-on experience with AWS or other cloud platforms (Azure, or GCP) and their ML services
Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for ML workloads
Proficiency with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and MLOps tools
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code principles
Databricks experience is a plus
Experience with feature engineering at scale and feature store implementations
Understanding of model monitoring, observability, and production ML challenges
Knowledge of data quality frameworks and automated testing for ML systems
Familiarity with distributed computing frameworks (Databricks or Sagemaker) for large-scale ML
Experience with experiment tracking and model versioning tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases, etc.)




Bonus points if you have:




Master's or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or related quantitative field Experience with real-time ML inference and streaming data pipelines
Knowledge of AutoML platforms and automated hyperparameter tuning
Familiarity with model compression, quantization, and edge deployment Experience with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud ML architectures
Contributions to open-source ML tools or platforms




Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
4 weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 days of the year




Application process:

Please submit your resume highlighting relevant experience and include a cover letter explaining your interest in the specific role
Provide links to relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or publications
Be prepared to discuss technical projects and problem-solving approaches in interviews

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
