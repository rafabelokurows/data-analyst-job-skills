The world of work as we know it is changing and we're looking for Trailblazers who are passionate about bettering business and the world through AI, driving innovation, and keeping Salesforce's core values at the heart of it all.

Ready to level-up your career at the company leading workforce transformation in the agentic era? You’re in the right place! Agentforce is the future of AI, and you are the future of Salesforce.

About Slack

Slack is the work operating system that brings your people, apps, processes and data together with trusted generative and agentic AI, fueling productivity for every employee in every role. Millions of people work in Slack every day with global teams, partners and customers, sending over 700 million messages and automating processes with over 3 million workflows daily. As part of Salesforce, Slack is where Agentforce, an always-on digital workforce, works alongside your teams and amplifies the impact of sales, service, HR, IT and more. To learn more and get started with Slack, visit slack.com .

The Role

We are seeking a seasoned Data Scientist to join our world-class analytics and data science team that supports growth marketing, product engagement, and scales data-driven decision making.

As Staff Data Scientist, you will work closely with cross-functional partners to proactively define Slack user-base engagement and the drivers of engagement across mediums (ex: email, push notifications, product nudges, etc.). You will help derive insights from data, communicate key findings to marketing and product executives, and directly contribute to building growth strategy and implementation. You’ll partner with Marketing, Product, and Engineering to contribute directly to campaign and product development –shaping what we build, how we measure success, and when/how we iterate and improve (experimentation).

What You'll Do


Lead Growth Strategy: Define and develop data-driven custom audiences and segmentation strategies to maximize user engagement and campaign effectiveness for marketing channels like email, push notifications, and advertising/retargeting.
Experimentation and Innovation: Drive a culture of experimentation. Lead end-to-end A/B testing and experimentation initiatives, from ideation and framework design to thorough pre- and post-analysis. You’ll constantly be working to uncover findings to dictate experimentation roadmaps.
Collaborate and Analyze: Partner closely with Product and Engineering teams to navigate complex data schemas, ensure data integrity, and establish clear KPIs to measure the effectiveness of marketing programs. Apply advanced data science techniques to analyze Slack product usage patterns, identifying what’s working, what’s not, and opportunities for improvement.
Define and report key success metrics, effectively communicating insights to Slack and Salesforce leadership to enable executive level decision making and follow-ups.
Synthesize Insights: Analyze and measure the impact of marketing channels on product engagement and conversion, translating complex data into actionable business insights.
Deliver Results: Establish/refine key input and output metrics, set aggressive targets with business teams, and support campaigns and experiences that deliver direct business impact.
Champion evidence-based decision-making, making data and insights accessible and scalable for stakeholders at all levels.


What You Bring


5+ years of experience in a Data Science role, with significant experience supporting Growth or Product Marketing teams.
Expertise in SQL and a strong command of a statistical programming language like Python or R for data manipulation and analysis.
Deep statistical knowledge and hands-on experience in experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests) and causal inference.
Proven ability to lead projects autonomously and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams to influence product and marketing strategy.
A solid understanding of marketing channels, user behavior, and key metrics related to tactics like email, push notifications, and paid media. Knowing fundamental metrics to track and how these channels impact the broader business.
Experience with data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Looker) and a track record of using data to tell a compelling story is a plus.
Experience working with large-scale data technologies (e.g., Snowflake, Spark, Presto, Hive, Hadoop). Knowledge in Apache Airflow is a strong plus.
Strong communication skills. Able to translate complex technical results into clear, actionable insights.
Experience designing and implementing advanced data models with scalability and efficiency.

The Model Behavior team shapes how our models interact with people. We view the model as the product itself, aiming to create intuitive experiences that exceed user expectations and feel like magic.

The team partners closely with research and product teams across the company to improve the real-world usefulness of our models at scale. Our work directly impacts hundreds of millions of users globally and contributes to OpenAI's mission of broadly distributing safe AI.

About The Role

We are looking for a full-stack engineer with experience in observability, tooling, and data pipelines to capture, aggregate, and surface production signals about human–model interactions. You will build systems to understand and act on (1) how users engage with our models and (2) where our models fall short, and develop robust evaluations to define and track improvements in model behavior. These signals power our understanding of real-world model performance and can be captured in creative ways beyond standard logging and metrics, requiring both technical skill and product intuition.

This role requires working across the stack — from building front-ends to surface & visualize insights to debugging back-end pipelines — and collaborating with cross-functional teams to ship iteratively under tight deadlines. You should thrive in scrappy environments, quickly prototype solutions, and care deeply about end-user experience and aesthetics.

This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of three days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

OpenAI's Training team is responsible for producing the large language models that power our research, our products, and ultimately bring us closer to AGI. Achieving this goal requires combining deep research into improving our current architecture, datasets and optimization techniques, alongside long-term bets aimed at improving the efficiency and capability of future generations of models. We are responsible for integrating these techniques and producing model artifacts used by the rest of the company, and ensuring that these models are world-class in every respect. Recent examples of artifacts with major contributions from our team include GPT4-Turbo, GPT-4o and o1-mini.

About The Role

As a member of the architecture team, you will push the frontier of architecture development for OpenAI's flagship models, enhancing intelligence, efficiency, and adding new capabilities.

Ideal candidates have a deep understanding of LLM architectures, a sophisticated understanding of model inference, and a hands-on empirical approach. A good fit for this role will be equally happy coming up with a creative breakthrough, investing in strengthening a baseline, designing an eval, debugging a thorny regression, or tracking down a bottleneck.

This role is based in San Francisco. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Design, prototype and scale up new architectures to improve model intelligence
Execute and analyze experiments autonomously and collaboratively
Study, debug, and optimize both model performance and computational performance
Contribute to training and inference infrastructure


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


Have experience landing contributions to major LLM training runs
Can thoroughly evaluate and improve deep learning architectures in a self-directed fashion
Are motivated by safely deploying LLMs in the real world
Are well-versed in the state of the art transformer modifications for efficiency

Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, analyzing user behavior on a feature to identify areas of improvement, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data analysis, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

The Strategic Finance team at OpenAI plays a critical role in shaping the company’s long-term trajectory. We partner closely with Product, Engineering, and Go-To-Market teams to inform high-stakes decisions through rigorous data science and economic modeling. As part of our expanding Data Science function, we’re building a best-in-class Forecasting capability to drive real-time, data-driven decision-making across user growth, revenue, compute infrastructure, and more.

We are developing scalable forecasting infrastructure to help us understand and anticipate business dynamics in an increasingly complex, usage-based world. Our models are foundational to planning, pricing, operational efficiency, and growth strategy - supporting key investment decisions and unlocking OpenAI’s full potential.

About The Role

We’re looking for a senior Machine Learning Data Scientist to lead our forecasting initiatives. You’ll be one of the founding members of the Forecasting pillar within Strategic Finance Data Science, responsible for building and scaling robust, interpretable, and production-ready forecasting systems. Your models will power critical business decisions by predicting core metrics such as DAU/WAU, revenue, LTV, compute consumption, and profitability.

This is a highly cross-functional role, requiring technical excellence, strong product intuition, and business acumen. You’ll collaborate with product managers, researchers, engineers, and finance leaders to operationalize forecasting insights, influence company-wide strategy, and build foundational forecasting capabilities at OpenAI.

This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Build statistical and machine learning models to solve forecasting needs across product, finance, infrastructure, and GTM domains.
Own the end-to-end modeling lifecycle, including scoping, feature engineering, model development and prototyping, experimentation, deployment, monitoring, and explainability.
Develop and productionize scalable, interpretable forecasts for user growth, monetization, compute load, customer lifetime value, and profitability.
Contribute to self-service forecasting tools and internal platforms, enabling teams across OpenAI to access and act on real-time predictions.
Research and evaluate emerging tools and techniques in the forecasting space, such as TimeGPT, large language model extensions, causal forecasting, and hybrid approaches.
Drive strategic insight generation by translating technical outputs into business-aligned recommendations and decision frameworks.
Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to ensure forecasts are well-integrated into planning processes, experimentation workflows, and executive decision-making.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You Have

Such steps would be taken to protect both the former member, as well as any relevant individuals from their care team, from impairment, risk of exploitation, or harm.

Fay is a 3-sided AI platform redefining preventative care with a b2b2c business in a box. We're one of the fastest growing companies in tech and the fastest growing company in wellness history. We combine clinical expertise with smart systems. The result? More affordable, effective care for the people who need it most.

Behind the platform is a Marvel team of builders deeply connected to the problem we're solving. We pride ourselves on attracting superstar talent — the kind that's driven the best growth-to-burn metrics since early Airbnb, Stripe, and WhatsApp. Those aren't our words, though. That's straight from our investors at General Catalyst, Forerunner, 1984, and Goldman Sachs.

If you're excited to build at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and real-world impact — we'd love to meet you.

About the Role

There are so many natural opportunities to infuse Fay's product with AI, from serving up highly creative and custom meal plans to streamlining the note-taking and appointment preparation that consumes so much of dietitians' time. Our list of AI-powered features is long and keeps growing, which means the Fay AI Team has its hands full with interesting, high-impact work and would love to have more smart and experienced AI engineers join the effort. We're looking for AI engineers who possess both a strong understanding of machine learning fundamentals and industry experience shipping AI features to users at scale — with an emphasis on generative AI.

What You'll be Doing:


Zero-to-one feature development: Prove out AI feature ideas, iterate on them and integrate them into the product when they're ready for prime time
Data curation and processing: Design the workflows and processes for gathering and storing data for model training
Model training: Fine-tune LLMs to unlock performance for our specific domain applications that's far beyond what off-the-shelf models can offer
Model evaluation: Rigorously evaluate the performance of your work using whatever method is appropriate, from human preferences/labels to synthetic ground truth
Technical leadership: In this role you'll have others looking to you for guidance on AI best practices and, more specifically, how to work with LLMs effectively


The best companies are made of the best people. There's no shortage of work ahead, but we stay balanced and look forward to celebrating our wins as a team.

See our careers page here to learn more about working on our team.

Fay is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

At Sierra, we’re creating a platform to help businesses build better, more human customer experiences with AI. We are primarily an in-person company based in San Francisco, with growing offices in Atlanta, New York, and London.
We are guided by a set of values that are at the core of our actions and define our culture: Trust, Customer Obsession, Craftsmanship, Intensity, and Family. These values are the foundation of our work, and we are committed to upholding them in everything we do.
Our co-founders are Bret Taylor and Clay Bavor. Bret currently serves as Board Chair of OpenAI. Previously, he was co-CEO of Salesforce (which had acquired the company he founded, Quip) and CTO of Facebook. Bret was also one of Google's earliest product managers and co-creator of Google Maps. Before founding Sierra, Clay spent 18 years at Google, where he most recently led Google Labs. Earlier, he started and led Google’s AR/VR effort, Project Starline, and Google Lens. Before that, Clay led the product and design teams for Google Workspace.

Our values


Trust: We build trust with our customers with our accountability, empathy, quality, and responsiveness. We build trust in AI by making it more accessible, safe, and useful. We build trust with each other by showing up for each other professionally and personally, creating an environment that enables all of us to do our best work.
Customer Obsession: We deeply understand our customers’ business goals and relentlessly focus on driving outcomes, not just technical milestones. Everyone at the company knows and spends time with our customers. When our customer is having an issue, we drop everything and fix it.
Craftsmanship: We get the details right, from the words on the page to the system architecture. We have good taste. When we notice something isn’t right, we take the time to fix it. We are proud of the products we produce. We continuously self-reflect to continuously self-improve.
Intensity: We know we don’t have the luxury of patience. We play to win. We care about our product being the best, and when it isn’t, we fix it. When we fail, we talk about it openly and without blame so we succeed the next time.
Family: We know that balance and intensity are compatible, and we model it in our actions and processes. We are the best technology company for parents. We support and respect each other and celebrate each other’s personal and professional achievements.

Slope is building AI-driven underwriting and credit infrastructure to power the future of embedded capital. We partner with leading platforms to help small businesses access financing seamlessly at the point of need.

The Role

We are looking for a hands-on, full-stack Data Scientist to bridge the gap between raw platform sales data and pre-approval decisions. This role is central to improving how we leverage real-time merchant performance data to automate underwriting and enable instant credit access.

You will own the data science foundation that transforms noisy transactional data into actionable signals for credit decisioning. Think of the problems faced by Stripe Capital or Shopify Capital—this is the type of modeling and data product we need to build.

What You’ll Do


Build and productionize models that map sales and payment data into reliable credit signals and pre-approval pipelines.
Develop frameworks to handle fragmented, messy sales data and normalize it for underwriting use.
Partner closely with Product, Engineering, and Risk to design pre-approval strategies and continuously improve model accuracy
Conduct exploratory analyses to identify leading indicators of merchant growth, default risk, and repayment capacity.
Translate insights into tools and dashboards that underwriters and product teams can act on.
Establish best practices for experimentation, back-testing, and data validation in underwriting contexts.


What We’re Looking For


3–6+ years experience as a Data Scientist, ideally in fintech, lending, or capital products.
Hands-on experience with sales/transaction data (e.g., card processing, e-commerce, platform transaction data).
Background in underwriting, risk modeling, or capital-as-a-service products (Stripe Capital, Shopify Capital, Square Loans, etc. experience highly valued).
Strong modeling and statistical chops: ideally has developed & shipped fraud or credit risk models E2E.
Comfortable writing production-quality code (Python, SQL, ideally some familiarity with data pipelines).
A bias for action—you enjoy building MVPs and iterating quickly with stakeholders.
Excellent communication skills: able to translate technical insights into business outcomes.


Nice to Have


Experience in credit risk, merchant lending, or BNPL.
Familiarity with data architecture for high-volume transactional platforms.
Prior startup experience (0→1 or scaling phase).


Why Join Us


Chance to shape the backbone of Slope’s underwriting engine at a critical growth phase.
Work alongside a high-caliber team backed by J.P. Morgan, Sam Altman, and world-class investors.
Ownership: as the first dedicated DS IC in this area (sales-data driven underwriting), you’ll set the standard for data science in underwriting at Slope.

Our platform, which reinvents expensive and time-consuming accounting processes, is the first step in our vision to unlock the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on manual insurance operations.

Our Series B, announced in early 2025, led by BOND & Workday, comes on the heels of record growth and accelerating expansion plans.

Why you should consider joining


Record-setting growth, having gone from zero to 8-figure ARR within three years of founding, representing 95th+ percentile company growth among startups that achieve these milestones
Strong product market fit revealed in growth and through customer love, with users describing the platform as “the best thing since sliced bread” and ""life-changing""
Our lean, talented team is creating category-defining products for large public and private enterprises, driving 7-figure ROI and cash-flow positive operations, providing the best of both worlds: outsized employee ownership and low company risk
We're continuing to take big, ambitious first-to-market bets for a highly committed customer base and an exciting pipeline of new customers
We’re in the early innings of our vision and poised to take advantage of the massive opportunity to deploy AI into core workflows throughout the insurance industry


About The Role

We're hiring an Applied Data Scientist to join us onsite in San Francisco. Our product is growing incredibly quickly, generating a massive dataset. But the insurance back office remains mired in manual processes. You'll have the opportunity to capitalize on this by building predictive models and AI-powered tools to transform what's possible for our customers.

Who you are


3+ years experience leveraging data-driven analysis and predictive modeling to drive key business decisions
Proficiency with SQL and relational databases
Proficiency with Python and associated data-processing libraries (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
Contributed to predictive systems in a production environment
Excellent written and verbal communication skills; ability to clearly explain your work and collaborate with stakeholders
Comfortable with handling ambiguity and working in a self-directed manner
Curiosity about different industries and the data + business context within them


Projects you might work on


Leverage the latest models to build agents automating natural language-based workflows
Build a system to orchestrate + optimize the processing of millions of transactions
Analyze the efficacy of a new product launch & recommend + drive product improvements


Our team & philosophy

We’re backed by BOND, Spark Capital, Neo, and Workday, as well as founders/executives from Brex, Asana, Plaid, Applied Intuition, Coalition, and more.

Our team hails from companies like Airbnb, Google, Brex, and LiveRamp and we’re fairly low-profile: focusing the majority of our energy on delivering for customers and building a category-defining company.

We’re hiring predominantly in San Francisco 🌁, as we believe in-person collaboration is strategically important for a company at our stage — both for velocity and company culture.

Benefits


Competitive base salary and generous equity
Generous medical, dental, and vision benefits
401K plan enrollment
Flexible time-off policy
Lunch & dinner every day
Paid parental leave
Company outings and offsites
(and more benefits as we grow!)


Comulate is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture that celebrates authenticity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, protected veteran status, or any other legally protected characteristics.

Compensation Range: $160K - $220K

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools

Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.

Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.

What You Will Do


Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, accounting, financial partnerships, and product teams to analyze and account for billions of dollars flowing through the Rippling payment platform.
Build full-cycle analyses using SQL, Python, or other scripting and statistical tools, and develop real-time metrics dashboards to manage key financial and operating levers of the business.
Monitor payment flows between systems, banks, processors, and inter-company accounts, perform daily account reconciliations, and follow up on any discrepancies.
React swiftly to emerging issues, summarize facts, and provide recommendations for the timely resolution of critical financial matters.
Collaborate with key stakeholders (Accounting, Compliance, Treasury, etc.) to understand business requirements and develop scalable solutions for reporting and reconciliation automation, including internal tool development and/or the implementation of third-party tools.
Develop and maintain comprehensive documentation of reconciliation processes and procedures.
Prepare and deliver data and reporting solutions supporting month-end close, regulatory & compliance reporting, and Internal and External Audit reporting.
Communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders through clear and concise presentations and reports.
Create, maintain, and ensure the completeness and accuracy of reporting databases and dashboards, and collaborate with data engineering to implement, document, validate, and monitor our evolving data infrastructure.


What You Will Need


Master’s degree or Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, MIS or other quantitative fields.
5+ years demonstrated experience in applying statistical analysis, modeling, machine learning and/or exploratory analysis to large datasets, ideally in payments processing, quote-to-cash financial reporting.
Experience with data warehousing, ETL, and reporting tools (e.g. Snowflake, Tableau, dbt, Dagster).
Extensive experience with SQL, Python, or other scripting languages and their application to all phases of the data science development process (initial analysis and model development through deployment).
Experience working with engineering, finance, and accounting teams to assess their data needs and build automated reporting pipelines.
Strong problem-solving and communication skills, with the ability to communicate findings and recommendations clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
Ability to interface with multiple stakeholders and senior leadership (C-suite) across the organization.
Bonus points if you have any experience with general accounting principles, with the general ledger close process, and regulatory compliance.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Each year, the healthcare industry generates over $200B in claims mispayments, creating incredible waste, friction and frustration for all participants: patients, providers, and especially payers. Machinify’s revolutionary AI-platform has enabled the company to develop and deploy, at light speed, industry-specific products that increase the speed and accuracy of claims processing by orders of magnitude.

At Machinify, we're building state-of-the-art Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems for medical records using cutting-edge techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). Our mission is to achieve human-expert level accuracy in medical document analysis — a highly challenging problem where traditional approaches, like vanilla Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fall short. While we've made significant strides, we're looking for an applied scientist to help us tackle the remaining core features and scale our models.

What We're Looking For: An applied scientist with a passion for solving real-world problems and expertise in NLP and/or CV to push the boundaries of AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Key Responsibilities: Solve complex problems in medical document understanding and question-answering using modern NLP and vision methodologies. Make data-driven decisions on algorithms and techniques tailored to specific business challenges. Work with limited and noisy labeled data, bootstrapping and iterating to improve model output in practical, real-world settings. Continuously evaluate and optimize models for scalability and performance in production environments. * Learn the intricacies of the healthcare domain and evolve into an industry expert over time.

About You: Expertise in NLP and/or Computer Vision: You stay up to date with the latest research and developments in these fast-evolving fields. Strong Software Engineering Skills: You write clean, production-quality code and are comfortable building scalable solutions.

Equal Employment Opportunity at Machinify

Propose new methods and research projects that align with the team's research agenda of understanding and improving the practice of deep learning


About You

We are looking for individuals passionate about improving the practice of deep learning itself, by reducing the toil and guesswork in getting good results with neural networks. An ideal candidate would be comfortable adopting a skeptical and curious mindset, be detail-oriented, and prioritize scientific rigor. We care a great deal about what measurements we are making, why we are making them, and exactly how they are performed.

In order to set you up for success as a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind, we look for the following skills and experience:


MSc or PhD in machine learning or a related field, or equivalent industry experience.
Strong software engineering skills and extensive experience using at least one deep learning framework, such as JAX or PyTorch.
Track record of releases, publications, and/or open source projects in deep learning


In addition, the following would be an advantage:


Experience using JAX specifically, since it is the deep learning framework the team uses
Research experience and accomplishments (e.g. software artifacts, scientific publications, etc,) in neural network training dynamics, training algorithms and optimizers, training recipes, or hyperparameter tuning


The US base salary range for this full-time position is between $188,000 - $230,000+ bonus + equity + benefits. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your targeted location during the hiring process.

At Google DeepMind, we value diversity of experience, knowledge, backgrounds and perspectives and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis as protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Are you looking to work at the forefront of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Would you be excited to apply AI algorithms to solve real world problems with significant impact? The Amazon Web Services Professional Services (ProServe) team is seeking a skilled Data Scientist to help customers implement AI/ML solutions and realize transformational business opportunities.

This is a team of scientists, engineers, and architects working step-by-step with customers to build bespoke solutions that harness the power of AI. The team helps customers imagine and scope the use cases that will create the greatest value for their businesses, select and train and fine-tune the right models, define paths to navigate technical or business challenges, develop scalable solutions and applications, and launch them in production. The team provides guidance and implements best practices for applying AI responsibly and cost efficiently.

You will work directly with customers and innovate in a fast-paced organization that contributes to game-changing projects and technologies. You will design and run experiments, research new algorithms, and find new ways of optimizing risk, profitability, and customer experience.

We’re looking for Data Scientists capable of using AI/ML and other techniques to design, evangelize, and implement state-of-the-art solutions for never-before-solved problems.

Key job responsibilities

As an experienced Data Scientist, you will be responsible for:


Implementing end-to-end AI/ML and GenAI projects, from understanding business needs to data preparation, model development, solution deployment, and post-production monitoring
Collaborating with AI/ML scientists, engineers, and architects to research, design, develop, and evaluate AI algorithms and build ML systems and operations (MLOps) using AWS services to address real-world challenges
Interacting with customers directly to understand the business challenges, deliver briefing and deep dive sessions to customers and guide them on adoption patterns and paths to production
Creating and delivering best practice recommendations, tutorials, blog posts, publications, sample code, and presentations tailored to technical, business, and executive stakeholders
Providing customer and market feedback to product and engineering teams to help define product direction


This is a customer-facing role with potential travel to customer sites as needed.

We're building the next Netsuite/Odoo for the AI-age (an enterprise operations platform)
Founded by the team that scaled GitGuardian and talent.io
Backed by top-tier VCs (3M€ pre-seed)
Thrive in fast-paced AI-startup
Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join a tight-knit, world-class early team
Competitive salary plus equity ownership
Location: Remote (EU)




Why now?

Legacy ERPs can’t handle real-time decisions, AI-native workflows, or modern business speed.
SMEs need to move fast, but their outdated tools slow them down.
Agent frameworks are ready for real business use.




Why join us?

You'll help invent a new category of enterprise software with a small, elite team. The problems go far beyond CRUD: real-time orchestration, autonomous IA-agents, proactive interfaces. This is foundational work. Backed by €3M from top-tier VCs (Daphni, Ovni, Motier …) and top BA (Pennylane, Studapart..) we’re moving fast from zero to one.




What you’ll build

The goal of our AI-native application is to have AI interfaces for most features

You’ll take part in building:

Configuration agents to help users create their automation workflows, adapt the data model to their particular needs, enforce their processes
Data querying agents to extracts precise metrics and information
Data storage merging structured and unstructured data, to extract high level business insights.
Recommendation agents to make our software pro-active




What you bring

You should have experience in both backend web development and Machine learning, applying rigorous, data-driven research approaches to product feature building.

We want you to have the drive to build a new kind of software, less passive, more flexible; and help drive the agentic vision.

Backend expertise: Strong Python skills, databases, distributed systems, and async processing (Django/FastAPI a bonus).
Applied AI skills: Experience with the python machine learning ecosystem, NLP, agentic frameworks (we know it’s a recent field), complex RAG systems.
Ownership: You own features end to end, from design and development to deployment and user feedback. You’re comfortable talking to customers and iterating quickly.

Talent beats checklists. If you're intrigued, apply anyway.




How we work

Total ownership: End-to-end impact.
Zero bureaucracy: Small, agile team driving rapid execution.
Craft with velocity: We move fast by shipping small and never compromising on excellence.
Radical prioritization: One goal at a time, done right.
No egos: Feedback with recommendations can come from anyone, across any team.




What you get:

Competitive salary (€90k to €120k/year) + meaningful equity.
Exceptional peers and a cutting-edge AI stack.
Ideal equipment and setup (top-tier gear, remote-friendly).
Regular company offsites (2–4 times per year) in inspiring locations.
Location: We have offices in Paris and Biarritz. You can also work fully remote, France (preferred)




Who’s building Piston?

We’re a tight-knit founding team that’s scaled from zero to growth before at talent.io and GitGuardian in the last 7 years. We've shipped product, built teams, and grown revenue from scratch. We work across product, engineering, and GTM as one unit, writing code, talking to users, and making the hard calls together. We’ve lived the pain of ERP firsthand, and we’re building the product we wish we had. We bias for action, care deeply about craft, and know how to move fast without breaking trust.




Interview Process (max 2 weeks)

Intro call with Eric (CEO) – 40 min
Technical deep dive with Eugène (CTO) – 90 min
Culture fit conversation with Florian (CRO) – 30 min
Reference calls (2)
Paid 2-day assessment
Fast offer




This is the moment to shape what come next, not iterate on the past

POSITION SNAPSHOT:

Our client is a pioneering AI company dedicated to transforming manufacturing processes through a “small data” approach to AI. In this role, you will be the first dedicated Data Scientist, responsible for building core AI capabilities that will directly impact manufacturing efficiency and sustainability at scale. You’ll work in a remote-first, collaborative environment, pioneering practical AI solutions that put an expert operator next to each industrial machine.




Key duties include collaborating on strategic technical decisions, rapidly prototyping and iterating on AI solutions, and developing and implementing Bayesian Optimisation algorithms that suggest batches of experiments. You will also implement knowledge transfer capabilities across machines and create robust data quality systems.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

🌟 Your Impact at Lila

As a Data Scientist in our Physical Sciences organization, you will transform complex experimental and testing datasets into actionable insights that drive our autonomous lab’s decision-making. You’ll partner with electrochemists, synthesis chemists, characterization specialists, and automation engineers to ensure data quality, build predictive models, and inform scientific campaigns across materials and device development.

🛠️ What You'll Be Building 

Data Infrastructure: Design and maintain robust ETL pipelines to ingest, validate, and preprocess data from diverse sources—electrochemical tests, materials characterization, and automated lab instruments.
Feature Engineering & Modeling: Perform domain-relevant data transformations, extract meaningful descriptors from raw data (e.g., voltage curves, spectroscopic signatures, image-based measurements) and develop statistical or machine learning models to relate independent variables (time, composition, etc.) to performance metrics and failure modes.
Analytics & Visualization: Create interactive dashboards and reports to communicate trends, anomalies, and key insights to scientific and engineering teams.
Active Learning Support: Collaborate with ML scientists to integrate your analytical outputs into active learning loops, helping to prioritize experiments and optimize resource allocation.
Cross-Functional Partnership: Work closely with R&D leadership, Product Managers, and automation specialists to translate scientific questions into data requirements and modeling strategies.
Reproducibility & Documentation: Establish best practices for code versioning, data provenance, and analysis notebooks; contribute to internal knowledge bases and publications.

🧰 What You’ll Need to Succeed

Master’s or Ph.D. in Data Science, Statistics, Materials Science, Chemistry, Physics, or a related quantitative field.
2+ years of experience in data analysis, statistical modeling, or machine learning—ideally applied to physical sciences or engineering datasets.
Proficiency in Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) and SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
Hands-on experience building ETL workflows using tools like Airflow, Prefect, or similar.
Strong foundation in experimental design, statistical inference, and multivariate analysis.
Familiarity with data visualization libraries (Plotly, Dash, or similar) and dashboard frameworks.

✨ Bonus Points For


Experience working with electrochemical or materials characterization data (e.g., impedance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy).
Materials-specific python libraries (pymatgen)
Exposure to cloud-based data platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and scalable storage solutions.
Knowledge of containerization (Docker, Singularity) and workflow orchestration (Snakemake, Nextflow).
Prior contributions to open-source data tools or scientific software.
Understanding of active learning, Bayesian optimization, or uncertainty quantification in experimental contexts.
