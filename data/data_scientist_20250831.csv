About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics. The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

Plan and execute the roadmap for your services together with the team
Play a pivotal role in designing the architecture of your data products, ensuring they are scalable, robust, and synergistic with our existing platforms
Research, build, test and deploy models - this is where you will spend most of your time. With a focus on team ownership, this gives a lot of time for our developers and data scientists to actually work technically instead of with process
Once deployed, you will continue to oversee your products, monitoring their performance metrics and making data-driven adjustments as needed to optimise result


WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR


at least 5 years of end-to-end data science and software engineering experience, preferably in a dynamic environment with a modern tech stack
Experience working in Operations, specifically significant experience in customer service automations
Experience with applying a wide variety of machine learning techniques to business problems, particularly with tabular and natural language data
Strong command of SQL, Python together with its scientific stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
Good understanding of Software Engineering practices (e.g. test-driven development, OOP, CI/CD, etc.) and experience with productionizing ML products
Recent hands-on experience in deploying and maintaining an AI agent/workflow powered by LLMs, using both low level SDKs (openai, anthropic, google-genai,..) and prompt engineering frameworks (llama-index, langchain, dspy, ..)
General understanding of LLMOps principles, for evaluating, testing, versioning and experimenting prompts in staging and production (langsmith, langfuse, arize-phoenix, lunary, ..)


WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY NOW

Our culture rewards ownership, excellence, and high energy. We care deeply about outcomes and hold each other accountable - we're here to win and fix one of the largest challenges Europeans face - closing the pension gap and democratising wealth. If this gets you fired up, reach out!

We believe it's our team's varied identities and backgrounds that make us sharper and stronger. We're committed to creating an environment where everyone feels respected and has equal opportunity to thrive in their careers.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The Team

In the Marketing Analytics team we are focused on improving the effectiveness of our marketing spend and help grow Wolt. We solve a variety of marketing challenges and help optimise Wolt’s marketing mix through attribution, MMM and Experimentation, enabling effective measurement of different marketing initiatives and working with the marketing team to identify areas for improvement and growth across all Wolt countries. Considering the scale of Wolt’s marketing function, there are many exciting problems to be solved and plenty of opportunities to make a business impact.

Data Scientists at Wolt work to uncover insights and turn them into relevant recommendations, driving decisions for the entire organisation. We partner closely with Marketing, Product, Engineering and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics and data science skills to drive business outcomes, we're looking for someone like you.

What you’ll be doing


Use statistical techniques, hypothesis testing, and experimentation to validate findings and drive business outcomes
Provide insights on marketplace dynamics, user behaviors, and long-term trends to our business
Conduct quantitative analysis and present data to uncover business drivers and insights beyond the numbers
Build analytics experiments, reports, and dashboards; perform ad-hoc data analyses using tools like SQL, R, or Python
Identify and measure levers to enhance metrics; make actionable recommendations
Offer clarity in ambiguous environments and collaborate across multiple teams and collaborate effectively across teams, including Marketing, Strategy & Operations, Product, Finance, and Engineering.
Mentor team members towards achieving actionable outcomes


Our humble expectations


5+ years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or related quantitative field
Skills in SQL queries, predictive modeling, and using visualization tools such as Looker or Tableau; experience with Python or R is a plus
Proficiency in experimentation techniques, including causal inference and A/B testing, with experience in experiment design and statistical analysis, with the ability to define success metrics and implement measurement strategies
Experience working closely with Marketing business teams using data to grow the business and familiarity with growth efficiency metrics
A creative and critical mindset, thriving in fast-paced, dynamic environments to resolve ambiguous problems using a structured, hypothesis-driven, and data-supported approach
Strong interpersonal skills, with the ability to work cross-functionally and influence both technical and non-technical audiences and ability to lead strategic projects to completion with cross-functional teams in scrappy environments
Humility and a team-player attitude, going out of your way to help teammates


What we offer


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can work onsite at our offices in Berlin, Helsinki, Stockholm, or Tallinn. Alternatively, you can work remotely anywhere in Germany, Finland, Sweden, or Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote, within the location above. 💙
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to the Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.

🛠️ Each agent is equipped with best-in-class tools, integrated seamlessly — from data retrieval to decision support to payout optimization.


🎯 The result? A powerful, compliant, and highly adaptive AI system that sets a new bar for enterprise-ready Agentic AI.



Tasks


You’ll work side-by-side with our CPO — but that’s not all. You’ll also have direct mentorship from our Head of Engineering. With 15+ years of startup experience — including at BCG Digital Ventures, SoundCloud, and Issuu — he’s scaled products from early MVP to millions of users, built world-class teams, and seen what it takes to win. You’ll learn how to build right — and build fast.





Build Agentic Systems: Use frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, or AutoGen to build robust AI agents that perform structured tasks with autonomy and reasoning


RAG Pipelines: Design and deploy retrieval-augmented generation systems to ensure accurate, grounded outputs from LLMs


Evaluate & Iterate Agents in Practice: Build evaluation loops using automatic metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), self-consistency, chain of doubt, LLM-as-judge, or custom classifiers


Production Integration: Work closely with backend and infra teams to integrate AI models into real products


Own AI Quality: Create tools and dashboards, CI hooks, or human-in-the-loop flows that ensure reliable auditable & explainable AI behavior at scale



Requirements



2–5 years' experience in AI/ML engineering**,** with a focus on LLMs, RAG, or NLP systems in a high-paced environment (e.g., start-up, scale-up)


Solid Python skills and hands-on with modern AI tooling (e.g., RAG-optimization, vector data bases, evaluation tools etc.)


Familiarity with prompt engineering, embeddings, and evaluating LLM outputs in production


Proven track record shipping in fast iteration loops with unsolved challenges in highly dynamic environment


Proactive, curious, and user-oriented—you want to build highly autonomous, scalable and auditable agentic systems with the best tools and frameworks in the market





Bonus Points For





Experience with AWS, GCP, or Azure for model deployment or vector storage - we will set-up AI agents in a multi-cloud environment


Familiarity with LLM finetuning or low-rank adaptation (LoRA)


Experience with insurance, regtech, or other high-compliance domains





Your First 30 Days





🤖 Ship an Agent: Build or refine an internal AI agent for a specific task (e.g. claim triage, document QA)


🔍 RAG Evaluation: Benchmark and compare two RAG pipelines using automatic and LLM-based evals


📈 Build Eval Dashboard: Make model quality and failure cases transparent across the team


🛠 Optimize Retrieval: Improve embedding relevance or chunking strategies for better grounding



Benefits

Wir stehen unseren Kunden als Wegbereiter ins Unbekannte, als Katalysator für Innovationen zur Seite. Denn wir sind uns sicher, dass man nur mit dem Mut, unbekannte Wege einzuschlagen, einzigartige Erfolgsgeschichten schreiben kann.

Wir schlagen Brücken zwischen kleinen Ideenschmieden und großen Konzernen, zwischen Management und Technologieexperten.

Durch unseren engen und partnerschaftlichen Austausch mit unseren Kunden können wir maßgeschneiderte und individuelle Lösungen anbieten. Ausschlaggebend für unseren Erfolg ist zudem unser einzigartiges Partnernetzwerk aus Industrie und Forschung. Durch die Nähe zu namenhaften Universitäten, wie der RWTH Aachen, vereinen wir Wissenschaft und Praxis.

Begeisterung wird bei uns großgeschrieben und bestimmt unseren Arbeitsalltag, weil sie der beste Antrieb ist!

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-5 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.




Who we're looking for

We are looking for a highly motivated Data Scientist, who is keen on building advanced predictive models and joining our growing Core Pricing team. The mission is to build a world-class Data Science team that turns ideas and resolves complex challenges into production-grade pricing and risk models effectively, safely, and consistently.




What you’ll do

Explore & analyse large telematics, policy and quote datasets to uncover trends and opportunities
Build and validate statistical & machine learning models that power pricing and risk selection
Collaborate with Engineering, Actuarial and Product to frame business problems and productionise models
Communicate insights clearly through dashboards, visualisations and storytelling
Contribute to best practice in code review, experimentation and shaping our ways of working as you grow




What you’ll bring

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Data Science or related field
Experience: At least 3 years of proven experience as a Data Scientist
Python Proficiency: Strong Python programming skills, with experience in training predictive models. Familiarity with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
SQL: Proficient in SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Statistical Methodology: In-depth knowledge of GLMs and other machine learning algorithms
Data Tools: Familiarity with cloud-based data platforms (we’re on AWS) and data visualisation tools (Looker, matplotlib, seaborn)
Software Engineering:
Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) and software development best practices in a data-intensive environment
Care about documentation and reproducibility
Curiosity and a problem-solving mindset
Excellent communication skills, with a proven ability to present complex information in a clear, accessible way




Nice to have (but not essential)

Experience with CI/CD pipelines (we use buildkite and argoCD)
Hands-on experience with insurance pricing tools like Akur8, Emblem or similar pricing modelling tools
Exposure to telematics or usage-based insurance data
Experience with time series analysis and/or graph technologies




What’s it like to work at Zego?

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things.

We’re spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We’re proud of our company and our culture – a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

Together, we’re setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There’s loads of room to learn and grow, and you’ll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you want.

You’ll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren’t afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we’re making insurance matter.




How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid.

Our hybrid way of working is unique. We don't mandate fixed office days. Instead, we foster a flexible approach that empowers every Zegon to perform at their best. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. You have the flexibility to choose the day that works best for you and your team. We cover the costs for all company-wide events (3 per year), and also provide a separate hybrid contribution to help pay towards other travel costs. We think it’s a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.




Our approach to AI

We believe in the power of AI to meaningfully improve how we work - helping us move faster, think differently, and focus on what matters most. At Zego, we encourage people to stay curious and intentional about how AI is leveraged in their work and teams to drive practical impact every day. This is your chance to do the most meaningful work of your career - and we’ll provide you with the tools, support, and freedom to do it well.




Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you’ll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. We also offer an annual flexible hybrid working contribution, which you can use to support with your travel to the office or towards your own personal development. And that’s just for starters.




We’re an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

We believe every decision maker can be empowered by technology. Skyral combines AI, leading edge simulation technology and world class expertise to transform the decision making experience. Our products and services enable faster and more confident decisions in a complex, unforgiving world. We deploy practical, intuitive and efficient solutions to governments and enterprises, delivering outstanding outcomes at the speed of relevance.

What We Do:

We are the Cities team. We build Digital Twins of Cities with a specific focus on providing data analytics not just of the city as-is, but - most importantly - what would happen as a result of a manipulation (answering the question “what if?”) We do so by modelling how population and infrastructure interact in systems such as transport networks and influence the environment, economy, policy, and terrain to allow decision makers to see the possible outcomes of their plans over systems with large geographic scale and complex requirements.

We are a multi-disciplinary team working together to build customer solutions from Core components (including an application development kit, base models that come with the platform, tools to help modellers build models more quickly and tools to help store, manage and process data) and customised data and integrations.

This is a fantastic opportunity for an individual who is early in their Data Science career or has recently completed a relevant PhD. We are looking to help develop individuals who have a keen interest in Traffic/Transport and/or Population/Behavioural modelling. As well as the work that we carry out for Urban Digital Twins, you will gain exposure to our projects relating to Defence and National Security.

Please note that due to the nature of this role, we can only consider applications from individuals who meet the criteria for Government SC Security Clearance.

What We Are Looking For:



You have experience with one or more of the following: human behavior modelling, crowd dynamics, social modelling, information dynamics, social media modelling, transport modelling, logistics modelling
Proficiency with Python is essential
Experience with geospatial data is a strong advantage
An understanding of agent-based modelling approaches
You have previously implemented models either by yourself or by closely collaborating with engineers
You have a degree in a STEM subject with a significant mathematical component. A PhD is not required but is an advantage





We You Will Be Responsible For:



Creating scientific models for our solutions as well as being hands-on in the process of model implementation
Working with delivery teams to interpret technical requirements and formulate them into scientifically defensible products
Delivering prototype and production-level implementations of model tooling as notebooks and code
Critically evaluating the results of simulations and presenting these back to key stakeholders and decision makers, while adapting your communication style to the relevant audience
Telling a story with the data from our products and simulations, remaining pragmatic about their limitations and providing a realistic view to colleagues, stakeholders and clients of the benefits and risks inherent to data-driven decision making
Spending time with our customers to understand their perspectives and inform their thinking as we create new products





At Skyral, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equality and inclusion. We also ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to reasonable adjustments. If you require such accommodations during the job application process we ask that you inform a member of our talent team.

Hi! 👋 We are Ravelin! We're a fraud detection company using advanced machine learning and network analysis technology to solve big problems. Our goal is to make online transactions safer and help our clients feel confident serving their customers.

And we have fun in the meantime! We are a friendly bunch and pride ourselves in having a strong culture and adhering to our values of empathy, ambition, unity, and integrity. We really value work/life balance and we embrace a flat hierarchy structure company-wide. Join us and you'll learn fast about cutting-edge tech and work with some of the brightest and nicest people around - check out our Glassdoor reviews.

If this sounds like your cup of tea, we would love to hear from you! For more information check out our blog to see if you would like to help us prevent crime and protect the world's biggest online businesses.

The Team

You will be joining the Detection team, a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low - and clients happy - by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error-free as code deployments. Google's Best Practices for ML Engineering is our bible.

Our models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs; every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it's down to the Detection team to investigate why.

About Navys




At Navys, we are building the most advanced funds lawyer, ever.




Navys is transforming the fund formation process by combining deep legal expertise with AI. This isn’t another contract review or document summarizer: we are creating the Legal Operating System for funds.




Navys fuses internal legal precision and external regulatory insight into a living system that learns, reasons, and scales with fund professionals.




We are seeking an ambitious Data Scientist to join our team on a full-time basis. This is a unique chance to work alongside experienced private funds lawyers, AI engineers, and innovators in a tech-forward environment. Navys is not just a better tool - it’s a different model of how legal software should be built. You’ll be working on a product that completely reshapes the legal industry.




As our first or one of our first data science hires, you’ll play a foundational role in building AI-driven legal intelligence systems, from data ingestion and modelling through to experimentation and deployment. You’ll work closely with engineering, product, and legal teams to design models and pipelines that power our platform.




What you’ll own (first 12 months)




Design, train, and evaluate machine learning models for legal and regulatory intelligence.
Build robust data pipelines for ingesting, cleaning, and structuring complex legal data.
Collaborate with software engineers to integrate models into production systems.
Partner with legal experts to translate domain knowledge into data features and model architectures.
Develop and maintain model monitoring, evaluation, and retraining workflows.
Contribute to the design of our AI/ML stack and establish best practices for data science across the company.




Must-have technical foundations




Strong proficiency in Python for data science and machine learning.
Experience with NLP, large language models, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Proven track record of building and deploying ML models into production.
Solid understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics.
Familiarity with cloud-based ML services (Azure preferred; AWS acceptable).
Experience working with APIs, databases, and structured/unstructured datasets.
Excellent problem-solving, analytical, and communication skills.
Desire to work in a fast-paced, dynamic start-up environment and a go-getter attitude.




Nice-to-have extras




Experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
Knowledge of Azure AI services (e.g., Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Search).
Background in legal tech, fintech, or another highly regulated domain.
Familiarity with MLOps tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases, Kubeflow).
Understanding of vector databases and semantic search.
Experience with data visualisation libraries (e.g., Plotly, D3.js).






You’ll thrive here if




You are talented, focused, and aligned with our mission - we are building a complex product with innovative technology, so we need driven and dynamic candidates who can rise to the challenge.
You take ownership of problems and run with them—figuring things out with limited direction when needed.
You are a strong communicator who gets your point across clearly, and you’re not afraid to speak up when something needs addressing.
You are independent, flexible, and prepared to take on responsibility early on.
You are prepared to be accountable for—and proud of—the work you do and your contributions to the team.




What we offer




Work with a veteran team of ex-employees of leading law firms, tech companies, and AI labs.
Direct mentorship from senior engineers, private funds lawyers, and product leaders.
5% pension contribution.
25 days holiday.
Private healthcare.
Cycle2Work and Electric Car Schemes.
Participation in the company’s employee share options scheme (subject to tenure and performance).
Health, fitness, and gift card discounts.
Annual Team Trip – 2026 is skiing in the Swiss Alps.
A rare opportunity to design the AI models and data strategy of a transformative legal platform from day one.

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Role Overview:

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer-centric decisions through seamless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalisation.

We’re seeking a motivated and collaborative Data Scientist to join our CLV & Next Best Action / Personalisation team, which builds models that help PlayStation understand and influence the value, growth, and engagement of our global player base.

By connecting player behaviours to long-term outcomes, our work creates the intelligence that underpins Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modelling and guides PlayStation’s Next Best Action and Personalisation strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation invests in, retains, and delights its players - and advance our use of modern machine learning at global scale.

This is an exciting opportunity to develop your skills in modern machine learning while contributing to high-impact projects that directly influence how PlayStation engages and retains its players.

What You’ll Be Doing:


Build and validate models for use cases such as churn prediction, purchase propensity, CLV modelling, and personalised engagement.
Work with sequential and behavioural data, applying machine learning approaches (e.g., gradient boosting, embeddings, sequence models) to capture player behaviour and growth.
Partner with commercial, finance, and lifecycle teams to translate business needs into modelling hypotheses that inform engagement strategies.
Collaborate with analytics and engineering colleagues to ensure models are efficient, robust, and scalable.
Communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical partners, ensuring insights drive measurable outcomes.
Grow your expertise in modern ML approaches (transformers, representation learning, sequence-to-sequence modelling) through high-visibility projects.


What we're looking for:

You’re curious, analytical, and eager to grow your skills in a commercial data science environment. You bring strong fundamentals in modelling and data manipulation, and you’re motivated by the challenge of applying these to impactful business problems.


Strong analytical and critical thinking skills, with a passion for understanding customer behaviour and enabling data-driven growth.
Practical experience with predictive modelling, such as churn, propensity, segmentation, or value modelling.
Proficiency in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries.
Ability to work with large datasets to uncover actionable insights that influence marketing, engagement, or retention strategies.
Interest or early experience in deep learning approaches — such as transformers, embeddings, or sequence models — with motivation to learn and apply them.
A collaborative attitude, with the ability to work in cross-functional teams.
A strong academic background (typically with a Master’s in a technical or mathematical field) or equivalent professional experience.


Nice to Have:


Experience with A/B testing or experimentation frameworks.
Familiarity with workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow), feature stores, or visualisation platforms (e.g., Tableau, Domo).
Exposure to gaming, e-commerce, or subscription-based business models.
Proven experience of analysing and modelling with “big data” technologies.
A personal interest in gaming and entertainment.


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)
Private Medical Insurance
Dental Scheme
25 days holiday per year
On Site Gym
Subsidised Café
Free soft drinks
On site bar
Access to cycle garage and showers

CSC Generation is on a mission to build the most advanced AI-driven retail operating system in the industry. Our brands—including Sur La Table, One Kings Lane, and Backcountry—rely on fast, intelligent decision-making rooted in high-integrity data.

We’re hiring an AI-First Data Scientist who combines deep statistical and machine learning expertise with modern MLOps tooling and automation instincts. You will design and deploy production-ready ML solutions, leveraging cutting-edge platforms like AWS Sagemaker, Vertiv, and advanced causal inference techniques such as Double Machine Learning (DML). Your work will not just inform decisions—it will automate, scale, and embed intelligence directly into our operating systems.

This is a highly technical, hands-on role with direct business impact. You’ll be embedded with senior operators and report directly to a brand CEO or platform leader, supporting mission-critical decisions and creating AI systems that improve themselves over time.




What You Get to Do Every Day

Lead the end‑to‑end ML lifecycle—from problem framing and data preparation through model training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
Build reliable data pipelines and features; ensure data quality, reproducibility, documentation, and auditability, on cloud-native platforms (e.g. AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI)
Develop predictive and causal models; design experiments to quantify impact and guide decision‑making.
Apply modern MLOps practices (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, CI/CD, observability) to keep models robust and maintainable.
Translate model outputs into clear recommendations; partner with stakeholders to drive adoption and iterate based on results.
Collaborate with engineering and product on secure integration, performance, and cost‑efficiency.
Continuously research and apply emerging techniques in AI, including generative AI, automated feature engineering, and reinforcement learning.




What You Bring to the Role

5+ years’ experience in applied data science/ML with a track record of deploying models to production.
Bachelor’s or Master’s in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, or related quantitative field.
Proficiency in Python and SQL; strong software engineering practices (version control, testing, reproducibility).
Experience with cloud‑based ML workflows and processing data at scale.
Familiarity with MLOps concepts (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, automated deployment, CI/CD).
Experience across predictive, time‑series, and causal modeling; ability to design experiments, A/B testing, and interpret impact.
Excellent communication: able to present complex work to non‑technical stakeholders and drive action.
Curiosity and a bias for building autonomous, decision‑supporting systems.




Why This Role is Different

Most data scientist roles focus on building models that live in notebooks. This one takes those models all the way to production—where they shape decisions in real time.

You won’t just be running experiments—you’ll be building the future of how our business thinks and operates. You’ll integrate AI directly into decision loops, create reusable data science products, and champion a culture of AI-first thinking across the organization.




What’s in it for you? Joining CSC Generation isn’t just about having a seat at the table—it’s about helping redesign the table entirely. You’ll be challenged, stretched, and supported as you grow faster than you thought possible. In addition to competitive compensation, we offer:

Executive Access: Work directly with brand CEOs and senior leadership, solving real business problems and earning mentorship from top operators.
AI-First Skill Building: Get hands-on with the most advanced AI tools in the market. From automation to prompt engineering, you’ll build a modern tech stack that sets you apart in any industry.
Accelerated Career Path: High performers are quickly entrusted with greater responsibility, new challenges, and leadership opportunities across our portfolio of brands.
Competitive benefits: Paid time off policies, 401(k)/RRSP match, medical/dental/vision and a variety of supplemental policies, and employee discounts at our portfolio companies

Meroka is building the future of independent medicine in the United States. We provide operations, finance, tech, and strategic support to physician-owned practices-helping them grow sustainably and with soul. This is in addition to support for physicians transitioning ownership to the employees of the business.

We believe in clear communication, practical systems, thoughtful design, and long-term thinking. Our tone is warm, grounded, and confident-but never corporate or clinical.

❌ This Role Is Not for You If…


You only want to train models rather than build end to end AI powered workflows
You are uncomfortable integrating third party systems like EHR, billing, accounting, and HR software
You prefer to work in research mode rather than shipping production ready features
You want rigid specifications instead of working iteratively with product and operations teams
You avoid regulated industries where compliance and auditability are critical


✅ What You’ll Do


Agentic Workflow Design: Build and deploy AI powered agents that connect across billing, finance, HR, payroll, and other practice systems to give users a single operational login
System Integration: Work with APIs and data pipelines to connect EHR, billing, and accounting software seamlessly into the Meroka platform

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


PhD + 3 years, MS/MA + 6 years or BS/BA 8 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth


About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

How You Will Make An Impact


Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency


Preferred Experience


Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of experience from a top-tier economic consulting firm (Analysis Group, Cornerstone Research, Charles River Associates preferred) OR 1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python


Who You Are


You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence

In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).<br><br></em><em>The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.<br><br></em><em>I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work.

Faire is an online wholesale marketplace built on the belief that the future is local — independent retailers around the globe are doing more revenue than Walmart and Amazon combined, but individually, they are small compared to these massive entities. At Faire, we're using the power of tech, data, and machine learning to connect this thriving community of entrepreneurs across the globe. Picture your favorite boutique in town — we help them discover the best products from around the world to sell in their stores. With the right tools and insights, we believe that we can level the playing field so that small businesses everywhere can compete with these big box and e-commerce giants.

By supporting the growth of independent businesses, Faire is driving positive economic impact in local communities, globally. We’re looking for smart, resourceful and passionate people to join us as we power the shop local movement. If you believe in community, come join ours.

About The Role

As an Applied AI/ML Scientist on the Search Group, you’ll work with world-class machine learning scientists to execute the ML algorithm strategy and system design powering one of the most critical levers for customer value and company growth—Search. You’ll collaborate on the advancement of real-time Search and Recommendation systems behind our next-generation shopping experiences.

You’ll operate at the forefront of algorithms—combining large language models, natural-language processing, query understanding, deep learning, transformer-based sequential modeling, graph neural networks, and structured behavioral data to return hyper-relevant, personalized products and brands for any given query.

This is a rare opportunity to work on end-to-end Search/Recommendation in a high-scale, deeply multi-modal environment, where we bring together the top talents from companies including Google, Meta, Amazon, LinkedIn, Uber, Airbnb, Salesforce, Twitter, Square, Pinterest, Instacart, and Coupang.

What You’ll Do

Contribute to the next-generation Search engine, integrating LLMs, query understanding, dense vector retrieval, deep personalization embeddings, multi-stage ranking, and reinforcement learning to serve personalized product feeds with <100 ms latency.
Design and productionize natural-language search and discovery systems, enabling intelligent agents to generate relevant and personalized collections, explain search results, and assist retailers in browsing, filtering, and evaluation.
Collaborate on model development and GPU-based deployment efforts, leveraging frameworks like Triton to scale inference reliably and efficiently.


You’re a Great Fit If You Have…


1-3 years of industry or research experience using machine learning to solve real-world problems, ideally including work in search, recommendations, or ads ranking.
Hands-on experience with deep-learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch) and vector-search infrastructure (e.g., Faiss, ScaNN, Pinecone).
A strong track record of productionizing models that blend LLMs (e.g., BERT, GPT-class) with structured features to drive personalization.
A product-focused mindset and a bias toward execution—you move quickly from paper to prototype to production.
Strong Python skills, deep respect for system reliability and ownership, and experience operating in high-stakes environments.
Excellent communication and cross-functional influence—you raise the technical bar beyond your immediate team.


Bonus Points For…


Contributions to open-source ML libraries or peer-reviewed publications in ML/AI.
MS or PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, or a related STEM field.

Today, Gusto offices in Denver, San Francisco, and New York serve more than 400,000 businesses nationwide.

Our mission is to create a world where work empowers a better life, and it starts right here at Gusto. That’s why we’re committed to building a collaborative and inclusive workplace, both physically and virtually. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy.

About The Role

Gusto’s Data Science team leverages Gusto’s rich dataset to guide product direction and decision-making. We operate full-stack, conducting analyses, prototyping and deploying predictive models and statistical tools both for internal use and for our customers.

For this role, we are looking for a technical leader (an individual contributor) to drive our customer facing upsell motions. You will improve a model-driven recommendation platform to better understand our customers, build lead scoring to drive Sales outreach, and predict and experiment against customer preferences in terms of communication timing and content. Overall you will be improving the long- term value that a customer gets from Gusto by ensuring that they use the products that are most relevant to their business needs and growth.

You’ll be working with an established team and seasoned Growth leaders in Engineering, Product, Design, Data Science, Marketing, and Sales. In this role, you’ll work cross functionally to build Platforms that span the entire breadth of the Growth Stack using machine learning and AI to personalize world class content for our customers and provide timely relevant product recommendations.

Here’s What You’ll Do Day-to-day


Build and deploy models and data products to support internal decision-making, delight our customers, and make our AI solutions even more intelligent.
Drive research into the problem space, work with stakeholders to understand model requirements, develop the model from scratch, deploy the model alongside your engineering counterparts, and monitor and maintain model performance over time.
Partner with Engineering, Design, and Product as well as Revenue counterparts in Sales and Customer Success to solve complex cross functional problems.
Envision and contribute to a robust code base that accelerates machine learning workflows and integrates best practices into our day-to-day operations (including how we partner with AI).
Learn and build iteratively so we can pressure test opportunities to improve our customers’ experiences and our internal optimization frameworks.
Knowledge share, mentor, and educate others on where machine learning and AI operate most effectively and what new ways we can drive more impact both within and outside of Gusto.


Here’s What We're Looking For


We love meeting people with different data backgrounds. For this role, we are looking for at least 7+ years experience building sophisticated and scaled data products with deep domain knowledge of machine learning techniques. This could mean either a MS or PhD in a quantitative field with at least 4 years experience in a business environment, or BS or Data Science Bootcamp graduate with at least 7 years of experience working as a data scientist in a business setting.
Experience developing and deploying modeling solutions in production code using Python such as propensity scoring, recommendation engines, and forecasting. A background in growth-oriented product development will accelerate the impact you can generate.
Strong programming skills - comfortable with all phases of the machine learning lifecycle, from initial analysis and model prototyping all the way through to monitoring and retraining.
Excellent communication skills - able to effectively deliver findings and recommendations to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and compelling fashion.
PhD or Masters plus equivalent experience in a quantitative field is a plus.
Experience leveraging customer feedback, chat transcripts, and LLMs as both inputs to the model and to generate outputs from a model is a plus


Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $165-205k in Denver, $200-250k for San Francisco, New York, and Seattle, and $185k-225k CAD for Toronto. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.

Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale.

Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas.

When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Gusto.

DataRobot empowers practitioners to deliver predictive and generative AI, and enables leaders to secure their AI assets. Organizations worldwide rely on DataRobot for AI that makes sense for their business — today and in the future.

Job Description

The Data Scientist role in the Customer Engineering team plays a pivotal role at the intersection of AI/ML engineering, solution development, and go-to-market strategy. We are looking for an experienced data scientist who excels in hands-on problem-solving, can lead technical initiatives, and can serve as a trusted advisor to both internal teams and customers.

Your work will focus on designing, developing, and delivering production-ready AI solutions that accelerate customer adoption of the DataRobot platform, with a particular focus on SAP workflows.

Beyond solution development, you will work directly with clients in various industries as the DataRobot product and data science subject matter expert.

This role is ideal for a motivated data scientist with proven experience who wants to work hands-on with Python, pandas, and modern AI tooling while making a significant impact on customer success and AI adoption. If you thrive in a fast-paced, highly autonomous environment and want to build AI solutions that truly scale, we'd love to hear from you!

Key Responsibilities:



Design and develop sophisticated, production-ready assets that accelerate AI/ML adoption for customers, ranging from reusable solution templates to deployable frameworks.
Lead the implementation of AI/ML workflows using Python, pandas, and modern AI tooling, ensuring they are scalable, maintainable, and customer-ready.
Establish and champion engineering best practices to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability of AI/ML solutions.
Work within existing infrastructure to support scalable AI deployments, including CI/CD automation, API integrations, and containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes).
Create comprehensive testing strategies and implement automated tests for AI/ML workflows.
Lead cross-functional collaboration with product, sales, and marketing teams to scale high-impact solutions.
Address complex real-world deployment challenges, including monitoring, logging, and improving reliability in AI/ML workflows.
Serve as a technical liaison in customer engagements, representing the DataRobot product to various personas from data scientists to C-level executives.
Lead proof of value processes and quantify the business impact of DataRobot solutions.
Ensure the success of our customers by collaborating with business stakeholders to ensure that AI solutions deliver successful business outcomes
Stay ahead of industry trends, continuously refining our approaches and advocating for best practices in AI/ML engineering.
Work closely with enablement teams to develop documentation, content, and training materials that scale adoption of our solutions.



What this Role is Not:



A SWAT demo team - while you will be customer-facing, this role is about building reusable solutions, not one-off demos.
A technical marketing role - you'll collaborate with marketing but won't be driving content strategy.
A pure research role - we need hands-on builders who can ship working solutions that make an impact.



Knowledge, Skills and Abilities:



Strong Python ecosystem expertise with the ability to design, develop, and troubleshoot complex ML workflows using libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and web server tools like FastAPI.
3-5 years of experience in data science, machine learning, or AI development with a proven track record of delivering production solutions.
Experience with ML model development, deployment, and evaluation. You should be comfortable leading data-to-insights projects and optimizing predictive models.
Strong data engineering capabilities, including working with structured/unstructured data, feature engineering, and optimizing ML pipelines.
Proficiency in writing efficient, maintainable, and well-structured code, with an emphasis on reusability, scalability, and production readiness.
Experience with software engineering best practices, including containerization (Docker), CI/CD automation, and cloud-based ML deployment.
Experience with APIs, SDK development, or ML platform integrations.
Proven experience in consultative sales processes in the data/analytics marketplace, with the ability to translate complex technical concepts into business value.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to influence stakeholders at various technical and business levels.
Self-motivated, driven, and eager to take on challenges. We're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-moving, high-growth, and high-autonomy environment.



Nice to Have:



Experience with SAP workflows and integration points
Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) for AI/ML deployment
Strong knowledge of automated testing and test-driven development
Familiarity with generative AI solutions like RAG, finetuning, etc.
Experience with DataRobot platform or similar enterprise AI platforms
Masters' degree in Data Science, Computer Science, or related field
Experience presenting at conferences or creating technical content



Why Join Us?



Hands-on, high-impact work - you'll be building real, production-ready AI solutions that customers actually use.
Small, elite team with direct influence - you'll work closely with product, engineering, and go-to-market teams to shape AI adoption strategies.
Fast learning environment - we invest in our people, providing opportunities to grow and expand your skills.
Clear career trajectory - whether you want to specialize in data science, transition into engineering, or take on leadership, we'll help you get there.
Work on cutting-edge AI solutions that have real-world impact and are used by enterprises worldwide.



This is a unique opportunity to build AI applications, ensuring that data scientists and developers can seamlessly create, customize, and deploy AI solutions at scale. If you're passionate about impacting the future of AI adoption, we'd love to hear from you.

Your models don't just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you, read on.

AlgaeCal is on the hunt for an Intermediate Data Scientist to develop mathematical algorithms and apply machine learning to analyze business data, test hypotheses, and turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.

This job will give you ALL the feels:

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world's only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you'll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.

This job might be for you if you've got...


2+ years experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You've built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don't just analyze numbers, you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You've used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that'll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis
Kaggle-level knowledge of artificial intelligence models. And if you think RAG is something you clean your countertops with, this probably isn't the role for you.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it's regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don't just apply models, you understand how they work under the hood
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You've worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You're the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don't just crunch numbers, you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You're proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability
Industry know-how that adds value. If you've got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that's a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI


Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you're nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can't wait to meet you.

You're humble—you put the team and others' needs ahead of your own
You're hungry to learn more
You're people smart--in the sense that you're a great teammate


The truth is, if you don't have these qualities you won't last long at AlgaeCal. So if you're missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.

What Will You Earn?

Our Intermediate Data Scientist position starts at $75,000 and can go up to $90,000 depending on your experience. If your salary expectations differ from this range, let us know! We are open to discussing compensation that matches your unique skill set.

At Scribd (pronounced “scribbed”), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our three products: Everand, Scribd, and Slideshare.

We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.

When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It’s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees – in partnership with their manager – can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

You avoid regulated industries where compliance and auditability are critical


✅ What You’ll Do


Agentic Workflow Design: Build and deploy AI powered agents that connect across billing, finance, HR, payroll, and other practice systems to give users a single operational login
System Integration: Work with APIs and data pipelines to connect EHR, billing, and accounting software seamlessly into the Meroka platform
Applied AI Automation: Translate repetitive operational tasks into AI driven workflows that save time for practice staff and physicians
User Facing Product Development: Collaborate with designers and product managers to ensure AI powered features are intuitive, reliable, and trusted by users
Compliance and Security: Design systems with HIPAA, SOC 2, and healthcare regulatory requirements built in from the start
Cross Functional Collaboration: Partner with operations, finance, and enablement teams to identify high impact workflows to automate and improve


🧠 We’re Looking For Someone Who…


Has 3 or more years of experience in software engineering with exposure to AI or agentic frameworks
Is fluent in building integrations with third party APIs and cloud based SaaS platforms
Brings strong programming skills in Python, TypeScript, or similar languages
Has experience working with LLMs and AI orchestration frameworks (LangChain, OpenAI tools, etc)
Understands how to build user facing applications with reliability, transparency, and auditability
Can work closely with product and design to deliver features that feel seamless to non technical users
Thrives in early stage environments where speed, ownership, and clarity are essential


💰 What We Offer


Competitive compensation and health benefits
Unlimited vacation and flexible working arrangements
The opportunity to shape the first AI powered workflows that unify all practice operations in one platform
Ownership of core features that directly impact how independent physician practices run every day
A thoughtful, ambitious team that values pragmatism, clarity, and long term thinking


🌍 Additional Notes


This role will require occasional travel to the USA and Canada for on-site campaigns, team collaboration, and brand activations. All travel will be coordinated and supported by the Meroka team.


📣 How To Apply


Send us your CV and examples of integrations, workflows, or AI powered features you have built. Bonus points if you include a Loom video walking us through a project where you automated a complex workflow or unified multiple systems into one user experience.

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.




About the Role:




We're seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to bridge the gap between our data products, data science insights and production systems. You'll be responsible for taking ML models from concept to production, building robust MLOps infrastructure, and ensuring our machine learning systems operate reliably at scale. This role focuses on the engineering aspects of ML design, deployment, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure.




What you will do:




Design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion to model serving
Build automated model training, validation, and deployment workflows using CI/CD best practices
Develop and maintain MLOps infrastructure for model versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment
Create robust monitoring and alerting systems for model performance, data drift, and system health
Optimize model inference performance and cost for production workloads
Collaborate with our Data Engineers to design and implement feature stores and feature pipelines
Develop automated data quality checks and validation frameworks for ML pipelines
Build scalable feature engineering workflows that support both batch and real-time inference
Implement data versioning and lineage tracking for reproducible ML workflows
Partner with Software Data Scientists to productionize research models and experiments
Implement frameworks for model evaluation and gradual rollouts
Design automated retraining pipelines and model refresh strategies
Establish best practices for model governance, documentation, and compliance
Work closely with Software Engineers to integrate ML capabilities into existing applications
Contribute to architectural decisions for scalable, maintainable ML systems
Participate in code reviews, documentation, and knowledge sharing across teams
Mentor junior engineers on ML engineering best practices




The right person for this role will have:




3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, MLOps, or related fields
Strong proficiency in Python for ML development and automation
Solid SQL skills for data manipulation and analysis
Hands-on experience with AWS or other cloud platforms (Azure, or GCP) and their ML services
Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for ML workloads
Proficiency with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and MLOps tools
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code principles
Databricks experience is a plus
Experience with feature engineering at scale and feature store implementations
Understanding of model monitoring, observability, and production ML challenges
Knowledge of data quality frameworks and automated testing for ML systems
Familiarity with distributed computing frameworks (Databricks or Sagemaker) for large-scale ML
Experience with experiment tracking and model versioning tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases, etc.)




Bonus points if you have:




Master's or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or related quantitative field Experience with real-time ML inference and streaming data pipelines
Knowledge of AutoML platforms and automated hyperparameter tuning
Familiarity with model compression, quantization, and edge deployment Experience with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud ML architectures
Contributions to open-source ML tools or platforms




Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
4 weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 days of the year




Application process:

Please submit your resume highlighting relevant experience and include a cover letter explaining your interest in the specific role
Provide links to relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or publications
Be prepared to discuss technical projects and problem-solving approaches in interviews

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels.

          <strong>About The Company<br><br></strong>At Scribd (pronounced “scribbed”), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our three products: Everand, Scribd, and Slideshare.<br><br>We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.<br><br>When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It’s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees – in partnership with their manager – can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs.

Location: Remote (Canada preferred)

Salary: $80,000-$120,000 CAD/year + Performance Bonuses + Fast Growth Upside

Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire Option Available)

🌍 About SETR

SETR is building the future of outbound sales — powered by AI.

We've replaced bloated SDR teams with intelligent, voice-powered AI agents that can cold call, follow up, and book meetings — all autonomously.

We're backed by serious operators, already cash-flowing, and scaling fast. We don't do red tape, bloated teams, or endless meetings.

We do fast execution, real results, and building something that will reshape the industry.

🎯 Who This Is NOT For:


People who need hand-holding or want to ""consult"" but not build
Builders who are afraid of AI, ambiguity, or rapid growth
Anyone who isn't obsessed with process, logic, and optimizing every workflow to the pixel


🚨 Ready to Build the Future?

If you're one of the best in the world at automation and AI agents — and want a seat at the table of something big — we want you yesterday.

Apply now, or DM us with your portfolio of automations, workflows, or bots you've built. Bonus points if you can break down how your systems generated actual revenue or saved hours.

🧠 TL;DR - Why This Role is a No-Brainer

We're SETR — one of the fastest-growing AI automation companies out there. We build autonomous AI sales teams that actually convert, powered by voice bots, multi-channel outreach, and intelligent workflows that replace humans.

We don't need more dashboards or consultants. We need a technical operator who lives and breathes automation and AI agent deployment, and can scale systems like a mad scientist.

You'll own the back-end automation architecture and help us redefine how companies grow.

🔥 What You'll Own (and Crush):


Build, deploy, and scale AI agents using tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, or your own prompt chains
Own the full automation stack — using n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Python scripts, and API integrations to eliminate grunt work across ops, sales, and onboarding
Design multi-platform lead engagement flows (SMS, email, AI voice, chatbot, calendar scheduling, CRM triggers) that feel like magic
Build smart logic into CRM tools like GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
Architect fail-proof triggers across multiple systems (GHL, Ringable, Slack, Twilio, Airtable, webhooks)
Ship clean, scalable, documented flows that convert like crazy and don't break under pressure
Continuously optimize, test, and improve workflows for speed, cost-efficiency, and performance


Requirements


3-5+ years hands-on building automations (n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Integromat, etc.)
Experience deploying AI agents — via Relevance AI, GPTs, LangChain, or similar tools
You've built real-world automations that save teams hours per day or generate revenue on autopilot
You understand APIs, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling deeply
You're obsessed with clean logic, smart triggers, scalability, and making sure flows don't break
You're a builder. You think in flows. You document your work like a pro
Bonus: Comfortable writing custom Python/JavaScript scripts to extend logic
Bonus: Experience with CRM tools like GoHighLevel, Salesforce, or HubSpot


Benefits


$80,000-$120,000 CAD/year depending on experience
Performance bonuses for hitting automation efficiency or revenue KPIs
Opportunity for equity or rev share as the company scales
Freedom to build your own automation playground — we trust you
Zero micromanagement, fully async-friendly, global team
Fast-track to a leadership position as we scale
