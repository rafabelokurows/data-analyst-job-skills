Every business is powered by contracts, but managing them can slow companies down and cost millions of dollars. Global innovators like L’Oréal, OpenAI, and Salesforce trust Ironclad to transform contracting into a strategic advantage - accelerating revenue, reducing risk, and driving efficiency. It’s the only platform that manages every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement or a complex NDA.

We’re building the future of intelligent contracting and writing the narrative for how contracts unlock strategic growth. Forrester Wave and Gartner Magic Quadrant have consistently recognized Ironclad as a leader in our category. We’ve also been named one of Fortune’s Great Places to Work six years running, featured on Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work, and recognized by Forbes’ 50 Most Promising AI Companies.

We’re backed by leading investors like Accel, Sequoia, Y Combinator, and BOND. We’d love for you to join us!

About The Role

Ironclad is accelerating its investment in AI to redefine how legal teams manage and understand contracts. As part of this effort, we are hiring an AI Evaluation Engineer to work within our AI Pillar. This role is focused on unlocking insights from our training data, designing feedback loops, and ensuring the continuous improvement of our agentic and ML or LLM-based systems through data-driven evaluation and iteration.

You’ll partner closely with AI Engineers and Product Managers to drive better model quality through systematic analysis, experimentation, and the curation of high-leverage datasets. Your work will directly impact the effectiveness of features like Smart Import, contract understanding, and agentic workflows.

What You'll Be Doing


Analyze training and evaluation datasets to identify distributional gaps, labeling inconsistencies, and long-tail opportunities.
Design and execute labeling campaigns, including development of golden datasets and annotation guidelines.
Build and maintain dashboards that track model accuracy, regression trends, and product-specific KPIs like success rate or answer helpfulness.
Investigate failure modes via prompt clustering, error taxonomy development, and user intent classification.
Operationalize feedback loops: mine product telemetry and human-in-the-loop reviews for signal, then translate into data-driven model improvement strategies.
Partner with engineers and PMs to run structured A/B tests and human evaluations for new models or features.
Support the development of scalable data and evaluation infrastructure for LLMs and agents.
Work with product, engineering and legal to create clear & transparent processes for the handling of customer data in AI training, fine-tuning and evaluation


About You


Bachelor's or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science, Applied Math).
1–3 years of experience in applied ML or data science, preferably in NLP or LLM-based applications.
Strong SQL and Python skills; experience with Jupyter, Pandas, and experiment tracking tools.
Comfortable navigating ambiguity, slicing large datasets, and communicating insights clearly to cross-functional stakeholders.
Experience with prompt analysis, clustering, or user behavior modeling is a plus.
Bonus: familiarity with LLM eval techniques, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or agentic system design.Experience with program management.


Why This Role Matters

AI is critical to the value Ironclad customers get from their contracts, allowing their business to manage risk, close revenue faster and operate more effectively. None of this is possible without reliable and accurate data. This role will lead these efforts, becoming a key contributor to the development of AI solutions in an industry that is likely to be transformed by the new generation of models.

What We Value


Bias for action and data curiosity
Ownership mindset and team-first attitude
Comfort in fast-paced, iterative environments
Passion for building AI products that solve real-world customer problems


Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Compensation Range: $180K - $200K

Kraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.




We’re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.




It’s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future.




KrakenFlex




The energy industry is undergoing the largest transformation since industrialisation at an unprecedented rate of change and we are positioning ourselves to be at the heart of that change. 




Our aim is to be the leading global provider of solutions that enable customers to release £30bn of value per annum from distributed energy resources (DERs). We are building a Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription business with a global addressable market of £2.4 billion per annum, by digitally connecting hundreds of thousands of DERs with energy markets.




We have already attained a market leading position and KrakenFlex is a recognised thought leader and innovator in the industry.




What you'll do
We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The US energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's a lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption
Often, we can only give you the question and not the answer, because if we knew the answer, we wouldn’t be hiring - are you someone who not only finds answers but creates value by coming back and asking better questions?
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the US energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future





What you'll need
A minimum of 3 years of professional python software development experience is required.
General interest in technology and problem-solving; Diligent and thoughtful
Good communication skills
Python
Django
Django REST Framework
Domain modelling
HTTP and REST APIs
Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
Celery and async processing
Postgres
Legally able to work within the USA

Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:
AWS
Terraform, Packer, Consul
React and Redux
Professional understanding of the US energy domain





What you'll love about us
Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options including FSAs
paid time off — we know working hard means also being able to recharge as needed, we trust our employees to get the work done and take the time they need
401(k) plan with employer match
Parental leave. Biological, adoptive and foster parents are all eligible. 
Pre-tax commuter benefits
Flexible working environment: you need to shift around your schedule? You do you, we genuinely believe in work/life balance. 
Equity Options: every Octopus employee owns part of the business. We’re a team, working together towards huge goals. Every person is crucial to our success, you should be rewarded as such. 
Modern office or co-working spaces depending on location








If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.




Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!




Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success.

Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

About The Job

Google's leadership team hand-picks thorny business challenges, and members of BizOps work in small teams to find solutions. As part of this team you fully immerse yourself in data collection, draw insight from analysis, and then zoom out to develop compelling, synthesized recommendations.

At YouTube, we believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share, and build community through our stories. We work together to give everyone the power to share their story, explore what they love, and connect with one another in the process. Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun — and we do it all together.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy

Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, analyzing user behavior on a feature to identify areas of improvement, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data analysis, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

If someone with a Headspace account is hired for a position, please note their account will be deactivated and they will not be able to use Headspace services for the duration of their employment.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><em><span>Further, if Headspace cannot find a role that fails to resolve an ethical issue associated with a dual relationship, Headspace may need to take steps to ensure ethical obligations are being adhered to, including a delayed start date or a potential leave of absence. Such steps would be taken to protect both the former member, as well as any relevant individuals from their care team, from impairment, risk of exploitation, or harm.</span></em></p><p>For how how we will use the personal information you provide as part of the application process, please see: https://www.headspace.com/applicant-notice</p>

We are training large-scale models that predict on-the-job performance more accurately than any human interview. Our platform already powers hiring at top AI labs, and we scaled from $1M to $100M ARR in 11 months—making us the fastest-growing AI startup on record.

What You’ll Do

In your first year you’ll ship analyses and experiments that move core product metrics—match quality, time-to-hire, candidate experience, and revenue. You’ll:


Define north-star and feature-level metrics for our ranking, interview analytics, and payouts systems.
Design/run A/B tests and quasi-experiments; turn results into product decisions the same week.
Build source-of-truth dashboards and lightweight data models so teams can self-serve answers.
Instrument events with engineers; improve data quality and latency from ingestion to insight.
Prototype quick models (from baselines to gradient boosting) to improve matching and scoring.
Help evaluate LLM-powered agents: design rubrics, human-in-the-loop studies, and guardrail canaries.


You’ll thrive here if

You have solid fundamentals (statistics, SQL, Python) and projects you’re proud to demo. You iterate fast—frame the question, test, and ship in days—and care as much about clarity of communication as you do about p-values. Curiosity about LLM evaluation, retrieval, and ranking is a bonus; you’ll learn alongside folks who’ve shipped at Jane Street, Citadel, Databricks, and Stripe.

Qualifications


0–2 years in data science/analytics or similar; BS/BA in a quantitative field (or equivalent work).
Strong SQL; Python for analysis; comfort with experiment design and causal thinking.
Communicates crisply with engineers, PMs, and leadership; turns analysis into action.
Nice-to-haves: dbt, dashboarding (Hex/Mode/Looker), marketplace or search/recommendation metrics, LLM/agent evaluation.


Perks


Generous liquid equity compensation
$20K relocation bonus
$10K housing bonus
$1K/month food stipend
Free Equinox membership
Health insurance


We consider all qualified applicants without regard to legally protected characteristics and provide reasonable accommodations upon request.

Fay is a 3-sided AI platform redefining preventative care with a b2b2c business in a box. We're one of the fastest growing companies in tech and the fastest growing company in wellness history. We combine clinical expertise with smart systems. The result? More affordable, effective care for the people who need it most.

Behind the platform is a Marvel team of builders deeply connected to the problem we're solving. We pride ourselves on attracting superstar talent — the kind that's driven the best growth-to-burn metrics since early Airbnb, Stripe, and WhatsApp. Those aren't our words, though. That's straight from our investors at General Catalyst, Forerunner, 1984, and Goldman Sachs.

If you're excited to build at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and real-world impact — we'd love to meet you.

About the Role

There are so many natural opportunities to infuse Fay's product with AI, from serving up highly creative and custom meal plans to streamlining the note-taking and appointment preparation that consumes so much of dietitians' time. Our list of AI-powered features is long and keeps growing, which means the Fay AI Team has its hands full with interesting, high-impact work and would love to have more smart and experienced AI engineers join the effort. We're looking for AI engineers who possess both a strong understanding of machine learning fundamentals and industry experience shipping AI features to users at scale — with an emphasis on generative AI.

What You'll be Doing:


Zero-to-one feature development: Prove out AI feature ideas, iterate on them and integrate them into the product when they're ready for prime time
Data curation and processing: Design the workflows and processes for gathering and storing data for model training
Model training: Fine-tune LLMs to unlock performance for our specific domain applications that's far beyond what off-the-shelf models can offer
Model evaluation: Rigorously evaluate the performance of your work using whatever method is appropriate, from human preferences/labels to synthetic ground truth
Technical leadership: In this role you'll have others looking to you for guidance on AI best practices and, more specifically, how to work with LLMs effectively


The best companies are made of the best people. There's no shortage of work ahead, but we stay balanced and look forward to celebrating our wins as a team.

See our careers page here to learn more about working on our team.

Fay is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Nooks is the AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) that automates the busywork so reps can focus on the human part of selling and generate more sales pipeline. Nooks has helped thousands of sales reps hit quota, saved customers hundreds of thousands of hours, and powered hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline. Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on full-funnel insights from sales data. You'll play a pivotal role in driving key decisions and building a data-driven culture at Nooks.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Optimizing call connection rates
Sales reps use Nooks to connect with prospects over sales calls. These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?
Conversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call?
Lead scoring and account insights
Nooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI ""deep research signals."" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
Expert in SQL and Python or R
3+ years of industry experience
Robust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods
Full stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.


Nice to haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments
Experience with data transformation and data orchestration tools


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market. In compliance with pay transparency laws and in pursuit of pay equity and fairness, we publish salary ranges for our open roles. On top of base salary, we also offer equity, generous perks and comprehensive benefits.

Slope is building AI-driven underwriting and credit infrastructure to power the future of embedded capital. We partner with leading platforms to help small businesses access financing seamlessly at the point of need.

The Role

We are looking for a hands-on, full-stack Data Scientist to bridge the gap between raw platform sales data and pre-approval decisions. This role is central to improving how we leverage real-time merchant performance data to automate underwriting and enable instant credit access.

You will own the data science foundation that transforms noisy transactional data into actionable signals for credit decisioning. Think of the problems faced by Stripe Capital or Shopify Capital—this is the type of modeling and data product we need to build.

What You’ll Do


Build and productionize models that map sales and payment data into reliable credit signals and pre-approval pipelines.
Develop frameworks to handle fragmented, messy sales data and normalize it for underwriting use.
Partner closely with Product, Engineering, and Risk to design pre-approval strategies and continuously improve model accuracy
Conduct exploratory analyses to identify leading indicators of merchant growth, default risk, and repayment capacity.
Translate insights into tools and dashboards that underwriters and product teams can act on.
Establish best practices for experimentation, back-testing, and data validation in underwriting contexts.


What We’re Looking For


3–6+ years experience as a Data Scientist, ideally in fintech, lending, or capital products.
Hands-on experience with sales/transaction data (e.g., card processing, e-commerce, platform transaction data).
Background in underwriting, risk modeling, or capital-as-a-service products (Stripe Capital, Shopify Capital, Square Loans, etc. experience highly valued).
Strong modeling and statistical chops: ideally has developed & shipped fraud or credit risk models E2E.
Comfortable writing production-quality code (Python, SQL, ideally some familiarity with data pipelines).
A bias for action—you enjoy building MVPs and iterating quickly with stakeholders.
Excellent communication skills: able to translate technical insights into business outcomes.


Nice to Have


Experience in credit risk, merchant lending, or BNPL.
Familiarity with data architecture for high-volume transactional platforms.
Prior startup experience (0→1 or scaling phase).


Why Join Us


Chance to shape the backbone of Slope’s underwriting engine at a critical growth phase.
Work alongside a high-caliber team backed by J.P. Morgan, Sam Altman, and world-class investors.
Ownership: as the first dedicated DS IC in this area (sales-data driven underwriting), you’ll set the standard for data science in underwriting at Slope.

Being part of the Qantas team requires each of us to rise to different challenges.

We work in a tough environment where we’re often expected to achieve the impossible, supported by good leadership, trust and respect. From our earliest days, people have been our priority; both the people who work for us, and the people who travel with us.

Today we employ over 30,000 exceptional individuals, with roughly 93% based in Australia, and together we fly over 50 million customers every year across Australia and around the world.

If you’re successful in joining us, you’ll be joining a team where creativity, diversity and innovation are encouraged. Every member of the Qantas Group enjoys the opportunity and support to follow their dreams, face new challenges and aim for the impossible.

You can submit an application for a role on our Careers siteOpens external site in a new window via the 'Apply' or 'Apply with LinkedIn' button located at the top of each job listing. The first time you apply, you'll need to create an account with us.

If you've already created your profile, you can sign in and access your application and personal information to update if necessary.

First impressions count, so ensure your CV is up to date and highlights skills and experience relevant to the job for which you are applying. This will give you the best chance of being short-listed for the next stage. There may be additional role specific questions which you'll need to answer so we can consider your application.

Assessment process

If you're successful in being short-listed, you'll be invited to attend an assessment. This may be one or a combination of the following: interview, psychometric testing, assessment centre or in tray exercises.

Interviews

Interviews provide an opportunity for us to get to know you, and for you to obtain more information about Qantas and the role you've applied for. Interviews will take place with a representative from Human Resources, the hiring manager or a combination of both. The number and type of interviews across the segments will vary.

We may utilise Behavioural Event Interview questions which are designed to get you to talk about how you responded to or handled specific situations or events in the past. To best answer these questions you need to set the scene, describe the action you took and explain what the outcome was.

Psychometric assessments

These may be used as an additional objective, reliable and relevant assessment method. Types of psychometric testing that may be used include verbal reasoning, numerical reasoning, abstract reasoning and personality tests

About The Job

You will leverage your expertise in behavioral sciences, and both quantitative and qualitative research, to evaluate the market potential and consumer appeal of new initiatives, particularly within sports, music, and media.

Strive Computing — AI as an Enduring Capability




At Strive Computing, we don’t just implement AI. We engineer it as an enduring capability — a permanent force multiplier that redefines how nations, enterprises, and family businesses compete and grow.

We build more than projects. We design scalable platforms, reusable systems, and products that evolve with time — architectures that endure, adapt, and expand. Our work ensures AI doesn’t remain a fleeting pilot or a headline, but a deeply embedded driver of transformation, resilience, and advantage.

Our model is different by design. We align with the ambitions of our partners — tailoring engagement models that are bold, performance-driven, and outcome-anchored. Long after deployment, our teams stay engaged: governing, scaling, and sharpening the systems we build to continuously unlock new layers of value.

A Proprietary Pipeline: A global network of 50+ family enterprises, each committed to adopting AI at industrial scale. Our first large deployment: a $250B financial services business.

San Francisco, CA (in-office, relocation supported)




We’re partnering with a YC-backed startup that’s building an AI-powered platform to reinvent one of the world’s largest industries. Voice is at the core of how their customers do business, and they’re hiring a Head of Voice AI to own the design, deployment, and scaling of voice systems that will power thousands of conversations every day.




This is a hands-on leadership role where you’ll prototype rapidly with low-code tools (VAPI, Retell) and then scale into custom voice infrastructure (LiveKit, Pipecat, WebRTC) as the company grows. You’ll build systems that handle everything from outbound prospecting to multi-turn applications, underwriting support, and 24/7 customer service - all while keeping latency below 700ms and delivering real business impact.




What You’ll Do:




Deploy production voice agents in weeks, not months, to drive immediate growth
Architect scalable infrastructure capable of handling 10,000+ concurrent calls
Build outbound agents that qualify leads, book meetings, and close pipeline gaps
Develop intelligent, multi-turn conversation workflows for long-form applications
Launch 24/7 voice agents for servicing, claims, payments, and renewals
Create internal tools and analytics to measure and optimize conversation quality




About You:




5+ years of software engineering experience, with 3+ focused on voice/audio systems
Hands-on experience deploying production voice AI systems at scale (50K+ minutes/month)
Strong background in telephony and real-time audio (SIP, RTP, WebRTC, VAD, AEC, noise suppression)
Proficiency in Python and TypeScript/Node.js for real-time systems
Deep knowledge of modern STT/TTS and conversational AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, etc.)
Track record of shipping features fast and measuring success by business outcomes
Based in San Francisco (or willing to relocate) and excited by an in-office, high-intensity startup culture




Why Join:




This is an early hire at a YC startup where voice is the biggest lever for scale. You’ll work shoulder-to-shoulder with the founders, ship daily, and directly impact revenue, efficiency, and customer experience. If you’ve built voice AI before and want to push the limits of what’s possible in real-world production environments, this is the role to do it.

Kraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.




We’re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.




It’s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future.




KrakenFlex




The energy industry is undergoing the largest transformation since industrialisation at an unprecedented rate of change and we are positioning ourselves to be at the heart of that change. 




Our aim is to be the leading global provider of solutions that enable customers to release £30bn of value per annum from distributed energy resources (DERs). We are building a Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription business with a global addressable market of £2.4 billion per annum, by digitally connecting hundreds of thousands of DERs with energy markets.




We have already attained a market leading position and KrakenFlex is a recognised thought leader and innovator in the industry.




What you'll do
We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The US energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's a lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption
Often, we can only give you the question and not the answer, because if we knew the answer, we wouldn’t be hiring - are you someone who not only finds answers but creates value by coming back and asking better questions?
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the US energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future





What you'll need
A minimum of 3 years of professional python software development experience is required.
General interest in technology and problem-solving; Diligent and thoughtful
Good communication skills
Python
Django
Django REST Framework
Domain modelling
HTTP and REST APIs
Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
Celery and async processing
Postgres
Legally able to work within the USA

Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:
AWS
Terraform, Packer, Consul
React and Redux
Professional understanding of the US energy domain





What you'll love about us
Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options including FSAs
paid time off — we know working hard means also being able to recharge as needed, we trust our employees to get the work done and take the time they need
401(k) plan with employer match
Parental leave. Biological, adoptive and foster parents are all eligible. 
Pre-tax commuter benefits
Flexible working environment: you need to shift around your schedule? You do you, we genuinely believe in work/life balance. 
Equity Options: every Octopus employee owns part of the business. We’re a team, working together towards huge goals. Every person is crucial to our success, you should be rewarded as such. 
Modern office or co-working spaces depending on location








If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.




Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!




Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it.

Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.

We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 13,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.

The Job

Our business generates a wealth of data with untapped potential to support people in need of aid, and improve their likelihood of positive outcomes in the legal system. Our platform covers a lot: evaluating a client’s case, giving advice, matching them with the right lawyer, formalizing the arrangement, and helping both parties work together as the case progresses. The data we generate across this end-to-end journey provides a unique opportunity to improve client experiences at a national scale for the legal practice areas we support, using novel data unavailable to other industry actors (individual law firms, government agencies).

We are looking for Data Scientists to join our team and leverage this data to fulfill our mission. You’ll help establish the central Data Science team with our Lead Data Scientist, and embed closely with departments within Atticus to help us better apply data across all areas of our platform.

Serve as a founding member of the company’s data science function, building a culture of collaboration, growth, and excellence that will attract talent for years to come


Design metrics, build data pipelines, run experiments, launch models – apply a broad toolkit to expansive data from a rapidly growing business
Work closely with department leads and their teams to ensure our decision-making and operations are data-informed
Interpret data as the collective voice of our clients, generating insights that inform our product roadmap and user experience
Hold teams accountable to measurable impact, enabling them to identify and target their most effective levers to improve the business


The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series B startup that doubles as a B-corp social enterprise. Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you’ll shape our company culture as we scale. We’re looking for data scientists who are excited about our mission and the challenges it entails.

Qualifications

Required:


You have 4+ years of relevant industry experience at a high-growth startup, or scrappy team at a larger company
You’re eager to jump in and serve as the primary data thought partner for a cross-functional team working on a novel and quickly evolving problem space
You’re excited about providing “full-stack” data support covering metric & data model design, exploratory analysis, testing & experimentation, and predictive modeling
You’re fluent in SQL, and have substantial professional experience with Python or R
You’ve built key metrics, reporting, and models from scratch for a product or business domain
You’ve leveraged A/B testing or causal inference methods to help teams identify and target their most effective levers


Bonus / Nice-to-Have:


You have experience working on a two-sided marketplace
You have experience with non-experimental causal inference methods
You’ve shipped and maintained model code in a production environment


We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.

Salary And Benefits

This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.

We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.

We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:


Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered
15 vacation days & ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end-of-year)
Free membership to OneMedical
$600/year reimbursable stipend for internet service
$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of work
Up to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance
401(k) and optional HSA/FSA
Humble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleagues


We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $150,000 and $200,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.

Location

This job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Live wherever, work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly. We care a lot about building a great culture and we think some interactions need to happen in person, so we put a lot of thought into retreats, offsites, and other ways to gather.

Kraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.




We’re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.




It’s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future.




KrakenFlex




The energy industry is undergoing the largest transformation since industrialisation at an unprecedented rate of change and we are positioning ourselves to be at the heart of that change. 




Our aim is to be the leading global provider of solutions that enable customers to release £30bn of value per annum from distributed energy resources (DERs). We are building a Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription business with a global addressable market of £2.4 billion per annum, by digitally connecting hundreds of thousands of DERs with energy markets.




We have already attained a market leading position and KrakenFlex is a recognised thought leader and innovator in the industry.




What you'll do
We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The US energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's a lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption
Often, we can only give you the question and not the answer, because if we knew the answer, we wouldn’t be hiring - are you someone who not only finds answers but creates value by coming back and asking better questions?
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the US energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future





What you'll need
A minimum of 3 years of professional python software development experience is required.
General interest in technology and problem-solving; Diligent and thoughtful
Good communication skills
Python
Django
Django REST Framework
Domain modelling
HTTP and REST APIs
Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
Celery and async processing
Postgres
Legally able to work within the USA

Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:
AWS
Terraform, Packer, Consul
React and Redux
Professional understanding of the US energy domain





What you'll love about us
Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options including FSAs
paid time off — we know working hard means also being able to recharge as needed, we trust our employees to get the work done and take the time they need
401(k) plan with employer match
Parental leave. Biological, adoptive and foster parents are all eligible. 
Pre-tax commuter benefits
Flexible working environment: you need to shift around your schedule? You do you, we genuinely believe in work/life balance. 
Equity Options: every Octopus employee owns part of the business. We’re a team, working together towards huge goals. Every person is crucial to our success, you should be rewarded as such. 
Modern office or co-working spaces depending on location








If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.




Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!




Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

We’re working with one of the most exciting early-stage startups in AI safety and evaluation to help them hire a Founding Engineer.




They're building the world’s first independent QA platform for conversational AI - with a strong focus on voice. They've already signed multiple Fortune 500 customers and hit $100K ARR in their first month. Backed by elite investors, the founding team comes from AWS and Microsoft, and they’re now looking for someone to help build and scale the core product.




What You’ll Do:




Build the brains: Architect intelligent systems that simulate, analyze, and evaluate voice and multimodal AI agents.
Scale for the real world: Design scalable infrastructure (Lambda, EC2, WebSockets, WebRTC) to support real-time conversation flows.
Engineer trust: Create detection and analysis pipelines that evaluate agent safety, alignment, and failure modes.
Own the stack: From prototyping to production, you'll lead key systems across backend, ML, and infra.
Collaborate closely with the founders on product strategy and technical direction.




About You:




You’ve shipped AI/ML systems in production - ideally in NLP, LLMs, or agent pipelines.
You’re comfortable taking projects from zero to one and owning the entire lifecycle.
You’re a creative problem-solver who thrives in ambiguous technical environments.
You’re scrappy, entrepreneurial, and excited to build in a high-velocity startup.
Bonus if you’ve worked on voice interfaces, WebRTC, or AI safety/alignment tooling.




Why Join




Define the tech and culture of a venture solving one of AI’s hardest problems: trust.
Work on hard, meaningful engineering challenges in conversational AI.
Join a proven, high-caliber team that’s already closing enterprise deals.
Competitive cash compensation and meaningful equity.
Build systems that shape the future of how we test and trust AI agents.




If this sounds like your kind of challenge, reach out and let’s chat.

Kraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.




We’re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.




It’s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future.




KrakenFlex




The energy industry is undergoing the largest transformation since industrialisation at an unprecedented rate of change and we are positioning ourselves to be at the heart of that change. 




Our aim is to be the leading global provider of solutions that enable customers to release £30bn of value per annum from distributed energy resources (DERs). We are building a Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription business with a global addressable market of £2.4 billion per annum, by digitally connecting hundreds of thousands of DERs with energy markets.




We have already attained a market leading position and KrakenFlex is a recognised thought leader and innovator in the industry.




What you'll do
We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The US energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's a lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption
Often, we can only give you the question and not the answer, because if we knew the answer, we wouldn’t be hiring - are you someone who not only finds answers but creates value by coming back and asking better questions?
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the US energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future

Postgres
Legally able to work within the USA

Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:

Master's degree or equivalent in a quantitative discipline such as Math, Economics, Statistics, Engineering, Sciences, or equivalent practical experience.
3 years of experience using analytics to solve product or business problems, coding (e.g., Python, R, SQL), querying databases or statistical analysis, or a relevant PhD degree.

About The Job

Find the user. Find the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with the user and ends with technology, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google’s products solve the world’s problems – from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And, we approach marketing in a way that only Google can – break the rules, redefine the medium, make the user the hero, and ultimately let the technology speak for itself.

As a Business Data Scientist in the Marketing team, you will support your team by delivering pieces of project work including supporting the implementation of data science solutions, supporting the improvement of data pipelines, or helping your team develop evaluation metrics that provide insights to the business. Specifically, as a Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) specialist you will play a strategic and technical role in driving all things media, marketing, analytics, and partnering with internal teams to evaluate strategic initiatives. Using first-party and third-party data sources, you will create innovative solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of Google’s media investment. At Google-scale, this implies working on our industry’s toughest challenges. Regardless of geographic location, the role will maintain a global scope and requires working with teams operating across regions and marketing entities.

Responsibilities


Provide support in media strategy, measurement, and optimization that requires expertise in advanced analytics work, with special focus on Marketing Mix Models (MMMs).
Partner with internal teams in advanced analytics work including experimentation, measurement, and modeling.
Identify patterns and behaviors that are effective predictors of performance and critical drivers for a successful media plan.
Deliver customer-centric, data-driven approach, based on a people-based marketing strategy to build, segment, and test audiences for best business results.
Develop evaluation frameworks for large-scale models, new metrics, and investigate anomalies. Frame and solve ambiguous problems by scoping technical priorities and innovating on statistical methods.

The Opportunity

We’re looking for an AI Engineer to join our Data and AI Engineering team. This role is ideal for those who are passionate about turning the latest AI advances — particularly LLMs (Large Language Models) — into production-ready tools, applications, and platforms.




You’ll work on the front lines of applied AI, helping to develop intelligent systems, scalable infrastructure, and internal platforms that power the next generation of life sciences solutions.




Whether you're just getting started or bring years of hands-on experience, we welcome engineers who thrive in collaborative, exploratory, and engineering-focused environments.




What You’ll Do

Design, build, and deploy LLM-powered applications and internal tools for use cases such as document understanding, process automation, and knowledge retrieval.
Develop reusable AI infrastructure and platform components that support application teams (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation, prompt management, model orchestration).
Work with embeddings, vector stores, and similarity search to enable contextual AI responses.
Integrate with vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate, or Pinecone) to support semantic search and information retrieval.
Build scalable APIs and services using FastAPI or similar frameworks.
Use tools like MLflow to manage model experimentation, versioning, and deployment.
Collaborate closely with Data Engineers and Backend Engineers to ensure smooth data access, secure service delivery, and continuous integration.
Apply good engineering practices around testing, observability, and CI/CD for AI components.
Support discussions on AI ethics, responsible usage, and explainability — especially for regulated use cases.
Contribute to architectural decisions, product discussions, and agile ceremonies.




What We’re Looking For

We believe diverse perspectives and backgrounds lead to better ideas. Even if you don’t meet every requirement, we’d still love to hear from you.




Core Experience & Skills

Hands-on experience working with or deploying LLM-based systems (e.g., GPT, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral, etc.).
Proficiency in Python, with experience building services using FastAPI or similar frameworks.
Working with embeddings for text or document representation and semantic search.
Familiarity with vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone).
Understanding of AI infrastructure: versioning, tracking, and deployment with tools like MLflow.
Exposure to building production-grade APIs, services, or workflows in an agile, collaborative environment.
Awareness of AI ethics, responsible AI practices, and explainability concerns.
Team-first mindset and experience in agile environments (Scrum or Kanban).
Professional working proficiency in English (our internal and client-facing working language).




Nice to Have

Experience with Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
Knowledge of prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or LangChain/LLamaIndex.
Experience with cloud-agnostic infrastructure or MLOps across Azure, AWS, or GCP.
Background in regulated industries (life sciences), especially GxP environments.
Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and monitoring tools for AI workloads.
Experience integrating LLMs into real-world applications such as chatbots, document classifiers, or summarizers.
Spanish and/or Catalan language skills.




What we offer

Hybrid work model and flexible working schedule that would suit night owls and early birds
25 holiday days per year
Possibilities of career development and the opportunity to shape the company future
An employee-centric culture directly inspired by employee feedback - your voice is heard, and your perspective encouraged
Different training programs to support your personal and professional development
Work in a fast growing, international company
Friendly atmosphere and supportive Management team.

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth




About the opportunity:

Jerry is looking for a data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company, with a focus on optimizing growth channels such as partnerships, marketing, and automation. As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.




Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.




Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).




The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.




I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""




How you will make an impact:

Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency




Preferred experience:

Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python




Who you are:

You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence

Type: Full-time

Compensation: $120K to $180K base + 0.20% to 1.00% equity

Visa: US Citizen/Visa only

Experience: Open to new grads




We’re working with one of the most exciting early-stage startups in AI safety and evaluation to help them hire a Founding Engineer.




They're building the world’s first independent QA platform for conversational AI - with a strong focus on voice.

What You’ll Do:




Build the brains: Architect intelligent systems that simulate, analyze, and evaluate voice and multimodal AI agents.
Scale for the real world: Design scalable infrastructure (Lambda, EC2, WebSockets, WebRTC) to support real-time conversation flows.
Engineer trust: Create detection and analysis pipelines that evaluate agent safety, alignment, and failure modes.
Own the stack: From prototyping to production, you'll lead key systems across backend, ML, and infra.
Collaborate closely with the founders on product strategy and technical direction.




About You:




You’ve shipped AI/ML systems in production - ideally in NLP, LLMs, or agent pipelines.
You’re comfortable taking projects from zero to one and owning the entire lifecycle.
You’re a creative problem-solver who thrives in ambiguous technical environments.
You’re scrappy, entrepreneurial, and excited to build in a high-velocity startup.
Bonus if you’ve worked on voice interfaces, WebRTC, or AI safety/alignment tooling.




Why Join




Define the tech and culture of a venture solving one of AI’s hardest problems: trust.
Work on hard, meaningful engineering challenges in conversational AI.
Join a proven, high-caliber team that’s already closing enterprise deals.
Competitive cash compensation and meaningful equity.
Build systems that shape the future of how we test and trust AI agents.
