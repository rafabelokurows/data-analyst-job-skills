About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics. The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

Plan and execute the roadmap for your services together with the team
Play a pivotal role in designing the architecture of your data products, ensuring they are scalable, robust, and synergistic with our existing platforms
Research, build, test and deploy models - this is where you will spend most of your time. With a focus on team ownership, this gives a lot of time for our developers and data scientists to actually work technically instead of with process
Once deployed, you will continue to oversee your products, monitoring their performance metrics and making data-driven adjustments as needed to optimise result


WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR


at least 5 years of end-to-end data science and software engineering experience, preferably in a dynamic environment with a modern tech stack
Experience working in Operations, specifically significant experience in customer service automations
Experience with applying a wide variety of machine learning techniques to business problems, particularly with tabular and natural language data
Strong command of SQL, Python together with its scientific stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
Good understanding of Software Engineering practices (e.g. test-driven development, OOP, CI/CD, etc.) and experience with productionizing ML products
Recent hands-on experience in deploying and maintaining an AI agent/workflow powered by LLMs, using both low level SDKs (openai, anthropic, google-genai,..) and prompt engineering frameworks (llama-index, langchain, dspy, ..)
General understanding of LLMOps principles, for evaluating, testing, versioning and experimenting prompts in staging and production (langsmith, langfuse, arize-phoenix, lunary, ..)


WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY NOW

Our culture rewards ownership, excellence, and high energy. We care deeply about outcomes and hold each other accountable - we're here to win and fix one of the largest challenges Europeans face - closing the pension gap and democratising wealth. If this gets you fired up, reach out!

We believe it's our team's varied identities and backgrounds that make us sharper and stronger. We're committed to creating an environment where everyone feels respected and has equal opportunity to thrive in their careers.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has earned Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years, we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app, we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team, working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

What You’ll Be Doing

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on identifying opportunities to optimize an in-house tool developed for support operations to resolve customer queries by identifying support ops needs, building supporting KPI & dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for product improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine product roadmap & automation capabilities.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track customer journey through the support, time to resolve queries and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation, and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communication skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in event tracking and product analytics.


What we offer


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can work onsite at our offices in Berlin, Helsinki, Stockholm, or Tallinn. Alternatively, you can work remotely anywhere in Germany, Finland, Sweden, or Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote, within the location above. 💙
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

Job Description

We are on a lookout for a hands-on Senior Data Scientist-Generative AI & Agents to join the Vendor Data Team on our journey to always deliver amazing experiences and go beyond prompt engineering into autonomous orchestration: designing agents that generate their own prompts, tools that empower AI with real-world actions, and judge models that validate outputs. Your work won’t sit in research notebooks — it’ll ship.

The Agentic AI team is building the next generation of AI-native products — intelligent systems that reason, act, and adapt. We combine the power of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to move beyond static prompts and chatbots into dynamic AI systems that solve real problems at scale. We don’t treat LLMs as tools to micromanage — we treat them as collaborators. Our products are designed to build and evolve themselves, leveraging AI to orchestrate workflows, make decisions, and continuously improve. If you’re ready to stop building brittle bots and start building AI that builds AI — this is your playground.


Architect and deploy agent-based systems using LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom frameworks
Build and optimize RAG pipelines — from smart chunking to embeddings and vector search - Fine-tune and evaluate LLMs for reliability, relevance, and factuality
Design evolving prompt and memory systems driven by LLMs and user feedback
Implement simulation and feedback loops using judge models or agent testing harnesses
Partner cross-functionally with product, research, and engineering teams
Stay current with the latest research in LLMs, generative modeling, and agent systems


Qualifications


Machine learning fundamentals (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning) - Data wrangling and preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
LLMs and NLP expertise (Transformers, BERT, GPT, etc.
Prompt engineering & fine-tuning
Knowledge of tokenization, embeddings, and attention mechanism
Using and fine-tuning Hugging Face models
Evaluation metrics for generative models (BLEU, ROUGE, faithfulness, hallucination detection)


Nice to have:


Open-source model experience (LLaMA3, Mistral, Mixtral) or custom inference stacks - Judge models, feedback loops, or synthetic user testing architectures
Familiarity with prompt injection defenses, output validation, or agent safety
Experience deploying generative AI in web or mobile products
Academic or industry background in statistics, cognitive science, or human-AI interaction


Additional Information

Ensuring you and all our Heroes are looked after, happy, and healthy is always on the menu. Because if you’re in good shape, then we’re in good shape.

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

You would be joining a flexible and dynamic team and your role will include:


selecting features, building and optimizing classifiers using machine learning techniques
processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
deep dive on the problems using SQL and scripting languages to drive solutions leveraging Statistical Analysis
implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone. Our recruitment process is free from discrimination of any kind — including on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

Ready to make an impact from day one?

ML Engineer - with Data Science Background (d/f/m)

Personio is growing rapidly. With that growth comes the increasing demand for machine learning solutions that don’t just provide insights, but power real, production-ready products.

As an ML Engineer, you will play a pivotal role in shaping Personio’s AI and ML capabilities. We are looking for someone who can build high-quality ML systems with the rigor of an engineer, while also bringing the curiosity and experimentation mindset of a data scientist. Your work will involve productionizing ML and generative AI models, ensuring they deliver measurable business impact.

You’ll join our central AI/ML function, collaborating across departments to drive innovation and enable AI-driven decision-making at scale.

What You’ll Do


Design, develop, and deploy robust machine learning and AI systems for a range of business use cases, including generative AI.
Build and operationalize ML solutions to address business challenges and unlock new opportunities.
Integrate ML and AI models into production systems, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
Deploy and monitor MLOps workflows, including CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, monitoring, and model versioning.
Leverage cloud platforms (AWS + Snowflake) and ML infrastructure (e.g., SageMaker, feature stores) for scalable deployment.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Product, Sales, Marketing, etc.) to deliver AI-driven features and insights.
Ensure all ML/AI solutions adhere to best practices in data privacy, security, and ethical standards.
Contribute to a culture of technical excellence, knowledge sharing, and continuous learning.


What You Need To Succeed


University degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
5+ years’ experience building and deploying production-grade machine learning models.
Strong software engineering mindset — ability to write clean, reusable, and scalable code in Python.
Experience integrating ML/AI models into production software systems.
Solid understanding of MLOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and automated testing frameworks.
Background in data science: comfort with experimentation, A/B testing, and measuring ROI/impact of ML projects (not just accuracy).
Hands-on experience with ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face).
Experience with NLP or generative AI techniques is a strong plus. Familiarity with cloud-based ML infrastructure (AWS, Snowflake, SageMaker, etc.).


Why this role?


Join a newly created AI sprint team focused exclusively on delivering LLM and ML-powered projects with real business impact.
Work in a lean, well-supported environment (dedicated TPM, analytics engineer, and data platform support — no need to build ingestion pipelines).
Full ownership of end-to-end ML delivery: from prototype to production.
Exposure to high-impact use cases (e.g., automating marketing campaigns, personalization engines) backed by executive sponsorship.
A chance to bridge the gap between data science and engineering, bringing cutting-edge AI into production at scale.


Why Personio?

We’re one of Europe’s fastest-growing tech companies, building the leading HR platform for SMEs. With over 15,000 customers, offices across Europe, and strong backing from top-tier investors, Personio is scaling fast — and AI is a critical enabler of that growth.

We’re also proud of our culture:


A diverse, inclusive workplace where your voice matters.
Competitive compensation, equity, and benefits. 28 days’ vacation, plus an additional day after two and four years.
Flexible, office-led but remote-friendly working with the option for international work weeks.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-5 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.




Who we're looking for

We are looking for a highly motivated Data Scientist, who is keen on building advanced predictive models and joining our growing Core Pricing team. The mission is to build a world-class Data Science team that turns ideas and resolves complex challenges into production-grade pricing and risk models effectively, safely, and consistently.




What you’ll do

Explore & analyse large telematics, policy and quote datasets to uncover trends and opportunities
Build and validate statistical & machine learning models that power pricing and risk selection
Collaborate with Engineering, Actuarial and Product to frame business problems and productionise models
Communicate insights clearly through dashboards, visualisations and storytelling
Contribute to best practice in code review, experimentation and shaping our ways of working as you grow




What you’ll bring

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Data Science or related field
Experience: At least 3 years of proven experience as a Data Scientist
Python Proficiency: Strong Python programming skills, with experience in training predictive models. Familiarity with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
SQL: Proficient in SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Statistical Methodology: In-depth knowledge of GLMs and other machine learning algorithms
Data Tools: Familiarity with cloud-based data platforms (we’re on AWS) and data visualisation tools (Looker, matplotlib, seaborn)
Software Engineering:
Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) and software development best practices in a data-intensive environment
Care about documentation and reproducibility
Curiosity and a problem-solving mindset
Excellent communication skills, with a proven ability to present complex information in a clear, accessible way




Nice to have (but not essential)

Experience with CI/CD pipelines (we use buildkite and argoCD)
Hands-on experience with insurance pricing tools like Akur8, Emblem or similar pricing modelling tools
Exposure to telematics or usage-based insurance data
Experience with time series analysis and/or graph technologies




What’s it like to work at Zego?

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things.

We’re spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We’re proud of our company and our culture – a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

Together, we’re setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There’s loads of room to learn and grow, and you’ll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you want.

You’ll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren’t afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we’re making insurance matter.




How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid.

Our hybrid way of working is unique. We don't mandate fixed office days. Instead, we foster a flexible approach that empowers every Zegon to perform at their best. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. You have the flexibility to choose the day that works best for you and your team. We cover the costs for all company-wide events (3 per year), and also provide a separate hybrid contribution to help pay towards other travel costs. We think it’s a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.




Our approach to AI

We believe in the power of AI to meaningfully improve how we work - helping us move faster, think differently, and focus on what matters most. At Zego, we encourage people to stay curious and intentional about how AI is leveraged in their work and teams to drive practical impact every day. This is your chance to do the most meaningful work of your career - and we’ll provide you with the tools, support, and freedom to do it well.




Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you’ll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. We also offer an annual flexible hybrid working contribution, which you can use to support with your travel to the office or towards your own personal development. And that’s just for starters.




We’re an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

We work across borders and cultures to be the universal symbol of trust in an ever-changing world. With vibrant office locations worldwide and over 50 nationalities, we’re proud to be an equal opportunity workplace with diverse perspectives and ideas.

Our purpose to help people and businesses help each other is a tall order, but we keep it real. We’re a great bunch of humans, doing awesome stuff, without fuss or pretense. A successful Trustpilot future is driven by you -- we give you the autonomy to shape a career you can be proud of. If you’re ready to grow, let’s go.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.




We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.




Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed. 







We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.




You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.




What you'll do
Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business






What you'll need
Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve 
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives





It would be great if you had
Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)

We believe every decision maker can be empowered by technology. Skyral combines AI, leading edge simulation technology and world class expertise to transform the decision making experience. Our products and services enable faster and more confident decisions in a complex, unforgiving world. We deploy practical, intuitive and efficient solutions to governments and enterprises, delivering outstanding outcomes at the speed of relevance.

What We Do:

We are the Cities team. We build Digital Twins of Cities with a specific focus on providing data analytics not just of the city as-is, but - most importantly - what would happen as a result of a manipulation (answering the question “what if?”) We do so by modelling how population and infrastructure interact in systems such as transport networks and influence the environment, economy, policy, and terrain to allow decision makers to see the possible outcomes of their plans over systems with large geographic scale and complex requirements.

We are a multi-disciplinary team working together to build customer solutions from Core components (including an application development kit, base models that come with the platform, tools to help modellers build models more quickly and tools to help store, manage and process data) and customised data and integrations.

This is a fantastic opportunity for an individual who is early in their Data Science career or has recently completed a relevant PhD. We are looking to help develop individuals who have a keen interest in Traffic/Transport and/or Population/Behavioural modelling. As well as the work that we carry out for Urban Digital Twins, you will gain exposure to our projects relating to Defence and National Security.

Please note that due to the nature of this role, we can only consider applications from individuals who meet the criteria for Government SC Security Clearance.

What We Are Looking For:



You have experience with one or more of the following: human behavior modelling, crowd dynamics, social modelling, information dynamics, social media modelling, transport modelling, logistics modelling
Proficiency with Python is essential
Experience with geospatial data is a strong advantage
An understanding of agent-based modelling approaches
You have previously implemented models either by yourself or by closely collaborating with engineers
You have a degree in a STEM subject with a significant mathematical component. A PhD is not required but is an advantage





We You Will Be Responsible For:



Creating scientific models for our solutions as well as being hands-on in the process of model implementation
Working with delivery teams to interpret technical requirements and formulate them into scientifically defensible products
Delivering prototype and production-level implementations of model tooling as notebooks and code
Critically evaluating the results of simulations and presenting these back to key stakeholders and decision makers, while adapting your communication style to the relevant audience
Telling a story with the data from our products and simulations, remaining pragmatic about their limitations and providing a realistic view to colleagues, stakeholders and clients of the benefits and risks inherent to data-driven decision making
Spending time with our customers to understand their perspectives and inform their thinking as we create new products





At Skyral, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equality and inclusion. We also ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to reasonable adjustments. If you require such accommodations during the job application process we ask that you inform a member of our talent team.

Around 2 years’ experience in data science or data engineering (or a relevant degree plus some hands-on data work) - we are happy to consider less experience if there is relevant other internships/work experience
A background in computer science, maths, physics, or data-related fields.
Curiosity, problem-solving skills, and a real interest in applying data to practical challenges.




📍 London-based, 2 days a week in the office




It’s a role with plenty of space to learn and contribute... ideal for someone early in their career who’s ready to develop their skills and work with modern tools in a supportive team.

About Navys




At Navys, we are building the most advanced funds lawyer, ever.




Navys is transforming the fund formation process by combining deep legal expertise with AI. This isn’t another contract review or document summarizer: we are creating the Legal Operating System for funds.




Navys fuses internal legal precision and external regulatory insight into a living system that learns, reasons, and scales with fund professionals.




We are seeking an ambitious Data Scientist to join our team on a full-time basis. This is a unique chance to work alongside experienced private funds lawyers, AI engineers, and innovators in a tech-forward environment. Navys is not just a better tool - it’s a different model of how legal software should be built. You’ll be working on a product that completely reshapes the legal industry.




As our first or one of our first data science hires, you’ll play a foundational role in building AI-driven legal intelligence systems, from data ingestion and modelling through to experimentation and deployment. You’ll work closely with engineering, product, and legal teams to design models and pipelines that power our platform.




What you’ll own (first 12 months)




Design, train, and evaluate machine learning models for legal and regulatory intelligence.
Build robust data pipelines for ingesting, cleaning, and structuring complex legal data.
Collaborate with software engineers to integrate models into production systems.
Partner with legal experts to translate domain knowledge into data features and model architectures.
Develop and maintain model monitoring, evaluation, and retraining workflows.
Contribute to the design of our AI/ML stack and establish best practices for data science across the company.




Must-have technical foundations




Strong proficiency in Python for data science and machine learning.
Experience with NLP, large language models, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Proven track record of building and deploying ML models into production.
Solid understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics.
Familiarity with cloud-based ML services (Azure preferred; AWS acceptable).
Experience working with APIs, databases, and structured/unstructured datasets.
Excellent problem-solving, analytical, and communication skills.
Desire to work in a fast-paced, dynamic start-up environment and a go-getter attitude.




Nice-to-have extras




Experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
Knowledge of Azure AI services (e.g., Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Search).
Background in legal tech, fintech, or another highly regulated domain.
Familiarity with MLOps tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases, Kubeflow).
Understanding of vector databases and semantic search.
Experience with data visualisation libraries (e.g., Plotly, D3.js).






You’ll thrive here if




You are talented, focused, and aligned with our mission - we are building a complex product with innovative technology, so we need driven and dynamic candidates who can rise to the challenge.
You take ownership of problems and run with them—figuring things out with limited direction when needed.
You are a strong communicator who gets your point across clearly, and you’re not afraid to speak up when something needs addressing.
You are independent, flexible, and prepared to take on responsibility early on.
You are prepared to be accountable for—and proud of—the work you do and your contributions to the team.




What we offer




Work with a veteran team of ex-employees of leading law firms, tech companies, and AI labs.
Direct mentorship from senior engineers, private funds lawyers, and product leaders.
5% pension contribution.
25 days holiday.
Private healthcare.
Cycle2Work and Electric Car Schemes.
Participation in the company’s employee share options scheme (subject to tenure and performance).
Health, fitness, and gift card discounts.
Annual Team Trip – 2026 is skiing in the Swiss Alps.
A rare opportunity to design the AI models and data strategy of a transformative legal platform from day one.




Equal Opportunity Employer




We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of age, disability, sex, race, religion or belief, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, or sexual orientation. All qualified applicants will receive consideration based on individual merit and business needs.

PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play — it’s also the Best Place to Work. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in entertainment producing The PlayStation family of products and services including PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, PlayStation®VR, PlayStation®Plus, acclaimed PlayStation software titles from PlayStation Studios, and more.

PlayStation also strives to create an inclusive environment that empowers employees and embraces diversity. We welcome and encourage everyone who has a passion and curiosity for innovation, technology, and play to explore our open positions and join our growing global team.

The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

Role Overview:

Our Data Science Analytics and Enablement (DSAE) team inspires PlayStation to make impactful, customer-centric decisions through seamless integration of data.

Currently there are over 100 people in the global DSAE team, including data science, data governance and analytics professionals. We work closely with engineering and product management teams to deliver data products, insight, predictive analytics, and data visualisation.

Data Scientists in the DSAE team apply sophisticated analytical methods and tools to drive value from the data through methods such as customer segmentation, predictive modelling, forecasting and other algorithms. Our work delivers an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviours and supports multi-channel targeting and personalisation.

We’re seeking a motivated and collaborative Data Scientist to join our CLV & Next Best Action / Personalisation team, which builds models that help PlayStation understand and influence the value, growth, and engagement of our global player base.

By connecting player behaviours to long-term outcomes, our work creates the intelligence that underpins Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modelling and guides PlayStation’s Next Best Action and Personalisation strategies. You’ll help shape how PlayStation invests in, retains, and delights its players - and advance our use of modern machine learning at global scale.

This is an exciting opportunity to develop your skills in modern machine learning while contributing to high-impact projects that directly influence how PlayStation engages and retains its players.

What You’ll Be Doing:


Build and validate models for use cases such as churn prediction, purchase propensity, CLV modelling, and personalised engagement.
Work with sequential and behavioural data, applying machine learning approaches (e.g., gradient boosting, embeddings, sequence models) to capture player behaviour and growth.
Partner with commercial, finance, and lifecycle teams to translate business needs into modelling hypotheses that inform engagement strategies.
Collaborate with analytics and engineering colleagues to ensure models are efficient, robust, and scalable.
Communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical partners, ensuring insights drive measurable outcomes.
Grow your expertise in modern ML approaches (transformers, representation learning, sequence-to-sequence modelling) through high-visibility projects.


What we're looking for:

You’re curious, analytical, and eager to grow your skills in a commercial data science environment. You bring strong fundamentals in modelling and data manipulation, and you’re motivated by the challenge of applying these to impactful business problems.


Strong analytical and critical thinking skills, with a passion for understanding customer behaviour and enabling data-driven growth.
Practical experience with predictive modelling, such as churn, propensity, segmentation, or value modelling.
Proficiency in Python and SQL, with fluency in common data science libraries.
Ability to work with large datasets to uncover actionable insights that influence marketing, engagement, or retention strategies.
Interest or early experience in deep learning approaches — such as transformers, embeddings, or sequence models — with motivation to learn and apply them.
A collaborative attitude, with the ability to work in cross-functional teams.
A strong academic background (typically with a Master’s in a technical or mathematical field) or equivalent professional experience.


Nice to Have:


Experience with A/B testing or experimentation frameworks.
Familiarity with workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow), feature stores, or visualisation platforms (e.g., Tableau, Domo).
Exposure to gaming, e-commerce, or subscription-based business models.
Proven experience of analysing and modelling with “big data” technologies.
A personal interest in gaming and entertainment.


Benefits:


Discretionary bonus opportunity
Hybrid Working (within Flexmodes)
Private Medical Insurance
Dental Scheme
25 days holiday per year
On Site Gym
Subsidised Café
Free soft drinks
On site bar
Access to cycle garage and showers

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


PhD + 3 years, MS/MA + 6 years or BS/BA 8 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Statistical expertise: Strong background in regression, categorical data analysis, experimental design, and survey development
Machine learning & AI: Practical experience applying ML and/or LLMs for pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and business decision-making
Business acumen: Proven track record supporting Growth, Revenue, Sales, and product teams with high-quality data-driven insights that influence outcomes
Strong communicator: Ability to translate complex data into clear recommendations for stakeholders at all levels
Hands-on builder: Comfortable moving quickly in a startup environment, balancing quick wins with long-term scalable solutions


Tech Stack & Tools You’ll Use


Languages & Programming: Python, R, SQL, DBT
Analytics & Modeling: Statistical modeling, customer segmentation, categorical data analysis, A/B testing, data analysis
Data Visualization & Reporting: Sigma, Metabase, Excel advanced, survey development
Applied ML: LLMs, sentiment analysis, predictive models for customer and market trends
Data Management: Cloud-based data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake)


Nice-to-Haves


Previous experience in PLG SaaS, Hybrid or early-stage investments
Exposure to valuation, due diligence, or board-level reporting
Ability to work across both technical product analytics and strategic growth initiatives

🤖 AI Notice

At Roofr, we’re big fans of AI. It helps us write job descriptions that don’t put you to sleep, takes notes during interviews so we can actually listen, and even helps us track down awesome humans like you.

Feel free to use AI to prep, research, or get pumped up for your interview (we see you, ChatGPT power users 👀). But when it’s time to chat, we’d love to meet you, not your AI alter ego. Bring your real, unfiltered self, we promise we will too.

And don’t worry, a real, live human is behind every part of our process. Every application is reviewed by a real person, and you’ll always speak with real humans throughout the interview process. No bots, just good people ☺️

CSC Generation is on a mission to build the most advanced AI-driven retail operating system in the industry. Our brands—including Sur La Table, One Kings Lane, and Backcountry—rely on fast, intelligent decision-making rooted in high-integrity data.

We’re hiring an AI-First Data Scientist who combines deep statistical and machine learning expertise with modern MLOps tooling and automation instincts. You will design and deploy production-ready ML solutions, leveraging cutting-edge platforms like AWS Sagemaker, Vertiv, and advanced causal inference techniques such as Double Machine Learning (DML). Your work will not just inform decisions—it will automate, scale, and embed intelligence directly into our operating systems.

This is a highly technical, hands-on role with direct business impact. You’ll be embedded with senior operators and report directly to a brand CEO or platform leader, supporting mission-critical decisions and creating AI systems that improve themselves over time.




What You Get to Do Every Day

Lead the end‑to‑end ML lifecycle—from problem framing and data preparation through model training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
Build reliable data pipelines and features; ensure data quality, reproducibility, documentation, and auditability, on cloud-native platforms (e.g. AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI)
Develop predictive and causal models; design experiments to quantify impact and guide decision‑making.
Apply modern MLOps practices (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, CI/CD, observability) to keep models robust and maintainable.
Translate model outputs into clear recommendations; partner with stakeholders to drive adoption and iterate based on results.
Collaborate with engineering and product on secure integration, performance, and cost‑efficiency.
Continuously research and apply emerging techniques in AI, including generative AI, automated feature engineering, and reinforcement learning.




What You Bring to the Role

5+ years’ experience in applied data science/ML with a track record of deploying models to production.
Bachelor’s or Master’s in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, or related quantitative field.
Proficiency in Python and SQL; strong software engineering practices (version control, testing, reproducibility).
Experience with cloud‑based ML workflows and processing data at scale.
Familiarity with MLOps concepts (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, automated deployment, CI/CD).
Experience across predictive, time‑series, and causal modeling; ability to design experiments, A/B testing, and interpret impact.
Excellent communication: able to present complex work to non‑technical stakeholders and drive action.
Curiosity and a bias for building autonomous, decision‑supporting systems.




Why This Role is Different

Most data scientist roles focus on building models that live in notebooks. This one takes those models all the way to production—where they shape decisions in real time.

You won’t just be running experiments—you’ll be building the future of how our business thinks and operates. You’ll integrate AI directly into decision loops, create reusable data science products, and champion a culture of AI-first thinking across the organization.




What’s in it for you? Joining CSC Generation isn’t just about having a seat at the table—it’s about helping redesign the table entirely. You’ll be challenged, stretched, and supported as you grow faster than you thought possible. In addition to competitive compensation, we offer:

Executive Access: Work directly with brand CEOs and senior leadership, solving real business problems and earning mentorship from top operators.
AI-First Skill Building: Get hands-on with the most advanced AI tools in the market. From automation to prompt engineering, you’ll build a modern tech stack that sets you apart in any industry.
Accelerated Career Path: High performers are quickly entrusted with greater responsibility, new challenges, and leadership opportunities across our portfolio of brands.
Competitive benefits: Paid time off policies, 401(k)/RRSP match, medical/dental/vision and a variety of supplemental policies, and employee discounts at our portfolio companies

What our interview process looks like:

📞 Step 1: If you align with our vision and meet the qualifications, we’ll reach out to schedule a conversation and introduce CSC.
🧠 Step 2: You’ll complete a short AI or product-building challenge so we can understand how you approach problems and execution.
💬 Step 3: Participate in deep-dive interviews with CSC leadership focused on your experience, product mindset, and operational thinking.
📩 Step 4: Offer. We’ll move fast for the right candidate.

1 - 3 years of experience in building Machine Learning models for business applications. Masters or PhD degree with demonstrated work in Machine Learning can be counted towards experience.
2+ years of programming experience in Python with a good grasp of software engineering standard methodologies such as code-reusability, modularity, use of reports, etc.
Proficiency with SQL, Hadoop and AWS is an asset.
An appetite for problem-solving with a creative and resourceful approach to finding the right solution for the job.
Conceptual understanding in a data-driven software engineering environment and how to leverage data to make business decisions.
A track record in building and maintaining high-quality, robust and maintainable code.
Experience in consuming and building APIs is a bonus.
A high level of comfort using Git.
Strong communication and collaboration skills.


What Sets You Apart


A growth mindset with versatile skills and the ability to work through problems from first principles.
A portfolio of projects that demonstrate your ability to draw inferences from data. This includes participation within the broader data science community, including Kaggle competitions or any personal projects with open data.
A can-do teammate willing to roll up their sleeves and do whatever is needed to move projects forward. That means, at times, you will wear different hats and be a project manager, developer, modeler, and chief communicator of solutions.
Amazing communication skills and ability to translate and communicate complex algorithms to non-technical individuals. Someone who understands that it is not enough to have a phenomenal algorithm but meaningful to build an agreement for the solution from different partners.
The best problems in the industry are yet to be articulated. We need someone who is creative, self-motivated and can lead projects independently.

Meroka is building the future of independent medicine in the United States. We provide operations, finance, tech, and strategic support to physician-owned practices-helping them grow sustainably and with soul. This is in addition to support for physicians transitioning ownership to the employees of the business.

We believe in clear communication, practical systems, thoughtful design, and long-term thinking. Our tone is warm, grounded, and confident-but never corporate or clinical.

❌ This Role Is Not for You If…


You only want to train models rather than build end to end AI powered workflows
You are uncomfortable integrating third party systems like EHR, billing, accounting, and HR software
You prefer to work in research mode rather than shipping production ready features
You want rigid specifications instead of working iteratively with product and operations teams
You avoid regulated industries where compliance and auditability are critical


✅ What You’ll Do


Agentic Workflow Design: Build and deploy AI powered agents that connect across billing, finance, HR, payroll, and other practice systems to give users a single operational login
System Integration: Work with APIs and data pipelines to connect EHR, billing, and accounting software seamlessly into the Meroka platform
Applied AI Automation: Translate repetitive operational tasks into AI driven workflows that save time for practice staff and physicians
User Facing Product Development: Collaborate with designers and product managers to ensure AI powered features are intuitive, reliable, and trusted by users
Compliance and Security: Design systems with HIPAA, SOC 2, and healthcare regulatory requirements built in from the start
Cross Functional Collaboration: Partner with operations, finance, and enablement teams to identify high impact workflows to automate and improve


🧠 We’re Looking For Someone Who…


Has 3 or more years of experience in software engineering with exposure to AI or agentic frameworks
Is fluent in building integrations with third party APIs and cloud based SaaS platforms
Brings strong programming skills in Python, TypeScript, or similar languages
Has experience working with LLMs and AI orchestration frameworks (LangChain, OpenAI tools, etc)
Understands how to build user facing applications with reliability, transparency, and auditability
Can work closely with product and design to deliver features that feel seamless to non technical users
Thrives in early stage environments where speed, ownership, and clarity are essential


💰 What We Offer


Competitive compensation and health benefits
Unlimited vacation and flexible working arrangements
The opportunity to shape the first AI powered workflows that unify all practice operations in one platform
Ownership of core features that directly impact how independent physician practices run every day
A thoughtful, ambitious team that values pragmatism, clarity, and long term thinking


🌍 Additional Notes


This role will require occasional travel to the USA and Canada for on-site campaigns, team collaboration, and brand activations. All travel will be coordinated and supported by the Meroka team.


📣 How To Apply


Send us your CV and examples of integrations, workflows, or AI powered features you have built. Bonus points if you include a Loom video walking us through a project where you automated a complex workflow or unified multiple systems into one user experience.

Strong experience with LLMs (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, open-source models) and prompt engineering
Experience building and maintaining production-grade AI systems
Proficiency in Python, JS/TS, or similar, with the ability to build and deploy full workflows
Familiarity with APIs, webhooks, vector databases, and automation platforms (Zapier, LangChain, etc.)
Ability to work independently, switch contexts, and move quickly without much oversight
Clear technical communication and systematic thinking


Preferred Qualifications


Experience in startup environments, AI tooling, or no-code/low-code stack integrations
Prior experience launching AI-powered products or tools
Familiarity with frameworks like Lang Graph, Pinecone, LlamaIndex, or RAG architectures
Strong intuition for product and user experience


💡 You're a Great Fit If You…


Ship real tools, not just demos
Can own an entire product or subsystem on your own
Love solving messy problems with clean code and smart automations
Thrive in ambiguity, move fast, and never wait to be told what to do
Are open to both career tracks: operator or co-founder
Are hungry for more than a job, you want a mission

NOTE: This is a full-time, permanent, hybrid position in downtown Vancouver, with 3 set days in the office and 2 WFH.

Job Overview

As a Machine Learning Engineer II, you independently design, build, and maintain machine learning systems that deliver impact for our customers and business. You are responsible for deploying reliable, scalable solutions — from credit scoring models to intelligent automation and LLM-powered features. You work across the stack to connect ML systems with real user value.

You own end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and transformation to model training, validation, and online inference. You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems.

You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.

You work closely with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to clarify problems, evaluate feasibility, and align technical solutions with strategic outcomes. You are a key contributor to the evolution of Spring’s ML platform and culture.

What You’ll Do


Own development of production-grade ML and AI systems — from data to deployment.
Build automated pipelines for training, feature engineering, and model serving.
Use AI tools to improve development speed and integrate AI capabilities (e.g. LLMs) into products.
Optimize systems for performance, latency, and cost.
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to scope projects and communicate results.
Monitor, retrain, and improve models based on feedback and system metrics.


What You Should Already Have


Experience deploying machine learning models into production systems.
Proficiency in Python and tools such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or HuggingFace.
Strong understanding of model lifecycle, MLOps, and data pipeline design.
Skills in inference optimization.
Ability to collaborate with data, product, and business teams on impactful ML features.
Experience with testing, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems.
Know-hows on cost/benefit analysis for different ML solutions, e.g. Lambda vs. Sagemaker Inference, OpenAI vs. xAI API.
Comfortable working with AI technologies (LLMs, embeddings, etc.) in applied settings.


What We Will Give You


Competitive annual salary ranging from $100,000 to $125,000+, reflective of experience and impact.
Comprehensive benefits package, including extended health, dental, and vision coverage — with 100% of monthly premiums covered by the Spring.
GRSP matching program to support your long-term financial goals.
Transit-Friendly Employer (Transit allowance).
A modern, collaborative workspace in the heart of downtown Vancouver.
Ongoing career growth opportunities and the chance to help shape Spring Financial’s technology strategy and team culture.


Please note: Upon applying, our Talent Acquisition team will review your resume. If you qualify, we will reach out to learn more about your experience and answer any questions you may have about the role, benefits, compensation, and more. Due to high application volume, we may not be able to respond to everyone.

Responsibilities

As a founding engineer you will own core systems end to end and ship V1s fast. You will turn messy GTM data into working product, instrument results, and iterate in tight build-measure-learn loops with Product and Sales.

Create the collective memory: Ingest and unify multi-source data into a multi-level context graph with strong tenant isolation.
Orchestrate agentic systems: Design planner and executor patterns, tools, and policies that transform context into actionable content and build lightweight evaluation harnesses.
Deliver where users work: Ship native surfaces and integrations within apps, chat, and GTM tools in collaboration with Product and Sales teams.
Prove outcomes: Define metrics such as tasks auto-completed and adoption rates, and wire observability for rapid ship-learn-iterate cycles.
Balance cost and reliability: Tune for accuracy, latency, and cost while implementing fallbacks and safeguards for real-world loads.

Qualifications

We’re looking for an owner-builder who can take a fuzzy problem from zero to one and then operate it reliably in production. You pair strong Python/backend fundamentals with practical product taste, sound data modeling, and the judgment to make trade-offs and ship.

4+ years of experience in building and owning backend or platform systems with measurable business impact.
Strong proficiency in Python and ability to establish cloud infrastructure and production services.
Experience in integrating messy, multi-source data into product-ready models with sound reliability, privacy, and multi-tenant boundaries.
Possess product thinking, a bias to ship, and comfort making decisions with approximately 70% of information.







Ideal Candidate Profile

Owner-builder who loves turning fuzzy problems into shipped systems and measuring real customer impact.

Early engineer from an AI/data/infra or GTM-tooling startup; comfortable owning a platform surface and taking it from 0→1→reliable operation.
Strong backend in Python; has stood up cloud services (preferably AWS) and production pipelines; familiarity with FastAPI/GraphQL, Postgres or DynamoDB, Kubernetes, Pulumi, and event-driven patterns.
Experience with agentic/retrieval systems or graph-shaped context; has designed planner/executor loops, added evals/observability, and shipped iterative improvements.
Sound multi-tenant data modeling, privacy, reliability, and fallback instincts; clear communicator of trade-offs.
Product taste: partners with Product and Sales, writes lightweight design docs, and iterates quickly based on metrics.
Able to work hybrid 3 days/week from San Francisco, New York City, or Vancouver (or relocate on an agreed timeline).

This is in addition to support for physicians transitioning ownership to the employees of the business.

We believe in clear communication, practical systems, thoughtful design, and long-term thinking. Our tone is warm, grounded, and confident-but never corporate or clinical.

❌ This Role Is Not for You If…


You only want to train models rather than build end to end AI powered workflows
You are uncomfortable integrating third party systems like EHR, billing, accounting, and HR software
You prefer to work in research mode rather than shipping production ready features
You want rigid specifications instead of working iteratively with product and operations teams
You avoid regulated industries where compliance and auditability are critical


✅ What You’ll Do


Agentic Workflow Design: Build and deploy AI powered agents that connect across billing, finance, HR, payroll, and other practice systems to give users a single operational login
System Integration: Work with APIs and data pipelines to connect EHR, billing, and accounting software seamlessly into the Meroka platform
Applied AI Automation: Translate repetitive operational tasks into AI driven workflows that save time for practice staff and physicians
User Facing Product Development: Collaborate with designers and product managers to ensure AI powered features are intuitive, reliable, and trusted by users
Compliance and Security: Design systems with HIPAA, SOC 2, and healthcare regulatory requirements built in from the start
Cross Functional Collaboration: Partner with operations, finance, and enablement teams to identify high impact workflows to automate and improve


🧠 We’re Looking For Someone Who…


Has 3 or more years of experience in software engineering with exposure to AI or agentic frameworks
Is fluent in building integrations with third party APIs and cloud based SaaS platforms
Brings strong programming skills in Python, TypeScript, or similar languages
Has experience working with LLMs and AI orchestration frameworks (LangChain, OpenAI tools, etc)
Understands how to build user facing applications with reliability, transparency, and auditability
Can work closely with product and design to deliver features that feel seamless to non technical users
Thrives in early stage environments where speed, ownership, and clarity are essential


💰 What We Offer


Competitive compensation and health benefits
Unlimited vacation and flexible working arrangements
The opportunity to shape the first AI powered workflows that unify all practice operations in one platform
Ownership of core features that directly impact how independent physician practices run every day
A thoughtful, ambitious team that values pragmatism, clarity, and long term thinking


🌍 Additional Notes


This role will require occasional travel to the USA and Canada for on-site campaigns, team collaboration, and brand activations. All travel will be coordinated and supported by the Meroka team.


📣 How To Apply


Send us your CV and examples of integrations, workflows, or AI powered features you have built. Bonus points if you include a Loom video walking us through a project where you automated a complex workflow or unified multiple systems into one user experience.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Develop and maintain ML and data pipelines (training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring) serving models that fight fraud and spam.
Implement access controls and data handling protocols to safeguard sensitive data at all stages of the ML lifecycle.
Collaborate closely within the Spam team and with NDA partner teams in Core ML and Security, aligning with best MLOps and privacy practices.
Contribute to model development, prototyping, and experimentation as the role evolves and the team’s needs expand.


What It Takes To Succeed


A solid foundation in software engineering fundamentals and best practices.
Experience with modern ML/Data Engineering tools: Python, Spark, AWS (S3, Redshift), and databases technologies (SQL/NoSQL), as well as Kubernetes.
Proven background building or adapting ML infrastructure or MLOps tooling for internal teams.
Deep understanding of privacy, data protection, secure engineering, and access control.
Familiarity with ML operations (MLflow, Kubeflow, Airflow, versioning, experiment tracking, model serving, CI/CD for ML).
Excellent communication skills, comfortable operating under NDA, and able to work proactively and discreetly on sensitive projects.


What You'll Get


Compensation range is $101,000-196,000 annually. Depending on your role and level, you may also be offered a bonus, restricted stock units, and benefits.

At Scribd (pronounced “scribbed”), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our three products: Everand, Scribd, and Slideshare.

We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.

When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It’s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees – in partnership with their manager – can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.

So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for “GRIT”. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to.

Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.




Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. For over five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck, Rakovina Therapeutics, and ImmVue Therapeutics.

          <p>Small molecule drug discovery is one of the most exciting open problems in machine learning. Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.</p><p><br></p><p>Variational AI is searching for a machine learning engineer to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence.
