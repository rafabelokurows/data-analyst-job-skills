At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has earned Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years, we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app, we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team, working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

What You’ll Be Doing

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on identifying opportunities to optimize an in-house tool developed for support operations to resolve customer queries by identifying support ops needs, building supporting KPI & dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for product improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine product roadmap & automation capabilities.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track customer journey through the support, time to resolve queries and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation, and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communication skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in event tracking and product analytics.


What we offer


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can work onsite at our offices in Berlin, Helsinki, Stockholm, or Tallinn. Alternatively, you can work remotely anywhere in Germany, Finland, Sweden, or Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote, within the location above. 💙
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

Companies like TravelPerk, QA, and Mural use Flank to automate contract negotiation, email triage, and security reviews. What used to take hours of manual work now happens automatically.

We're building in an emerging market that's reshaping how businesses operate. Instead of incremental software improvements, we're designing entirely new ways for AI and humans to collaborate.

If you're excited about defining what's possible when AI becomes a true colleague, you'll find a home here.

We’re seeking an experienced AI Engineer to drive our applied AI initiatives.

We’re a fast-moving start-up where you’ll work closely with product, design, and commercial teams to ship real AI into production — not just research experiments.

You will be tasked with leveraging emerging technologies and a team of legal experts to improve the intelligence and autonomy of our agents.

This might start with building an evals framework in collaboration with our team of lawyers, it might spawn a hypervisor that governs every step of our agentic system and that “knows what good looks like”, and it might end with us building the first alignment program for legal AI systems.

What you’ll be doing:


Drive Applied Research: Drive applied research into LLMs and agentic systems, rapidly prototyping, validating, and shipping production-ready capabilities.
Stay Ahead of the Curve: Stay hands-on with the latest advances in foundation models, LLM-as-a-judge, agentic frameworks & tools (e.g. MCP), and move fast to bring them into the product.


Who you are:


Demonstrated Experience: A strong track record of leading and delivering cutting-edge AI initiatives that have driven meaningful product and business impact. Hands-on experience building and deploying ML/AI products is essential.
Technical Expertise:
Strong programming skills in Python (and familiarity with TypeScript/Go a plus).
Experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face).
Hands-on experience deploying ML/LLM models in production environments.
Solid understanding of data pipelines, APIs, and distributed systems.
Knowledge of prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and embeddings for LLMs.
Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes
Thought Leadership: Ph.D. or Master’s in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related field from a leading academic institution.
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Proven ability to build strong partnerships across product, engineering, and research teams to drive innovation.


What’s In It For You


Innovative Work: Be part of a team making bold bets to create a new paradigm in AI-enhanced legal services.
High Standards Culture: Join a team that demands excellence and accountability through direct and candid communication.
Empowered Environment: Operate in a high-agency culture where you can lead yourself and make a real impact.
Global Team: Remote-first, collaborate with a diverse, talented team across the globe.
Competitive, Benchmarked Salary

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Staff Machine Learning Research Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics..

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!

At Prestatech, we're redefining the financial world by fostering innovation and challenging the traditional banking system. Our culture is diverse, dynamic, and forward-thinking. From our offices in Berlin and Milan, we create cutting-edge API technologies in an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best work.

Founded in 2021 by Christian Nothacker, Luca Terragni, and Lorenzo Giusti, Prestatech combines document automation and proprietary technology to help financial institutions and B2B companies make quick, reliable, and inclusive credit decisions for SMEs and consumers.

When most people think of getting a loan or mortgage, they picture a slow and tedious process. Our mission is to simplify that through technology.

We’re a young and fast-growing company—but this is our second venture. Before Prestatech, we founded and exited Prestacap, a lending platform for SMEs active in Italy and Germany.

We’re passionate about data and technology, never satisfied with the status quo, and believe that teamwork is key to achieving ambitious goals together.

To date, we have raised €8 million, which is helping us bring more innovative solutions to market, expand operations in Italy, and launch in the UK, Germany, and the US..

We’re now looking for a Senior Data Scientist, someone with prior experience in fintech who is hands-on, outcome-driven, and deeply curious about solving business problems with data and AI.

You would be joining a flexible and dynamic team and your role will include:


selecting features, building and optimizing classifiers using machine learning techniques
processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
deep dive on the problems using SQL and scripting languages to drive solutions leveraging Statistical Analysis
implement and scale data pipelines and solutions using Big Data technologies
design, train, and deploy machine learning models and AI-based solutions for credit scoring, fraud detection, and other core financial applications.
collaborate closely with the development team to recommend and build innovations based on Data Science
own the process: identify and execute on high impact projects, triage external requests, and make sure you bring projects to conclusion in time for the results to be useful
leverage AI tools to achieve even better and faster results


Requirements:


6+ years of experience in Data Science, ideally in fintech or financial services
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics or related field (MSc/PhD preferred)
Strong understanding of Big Data frameworks and cloud platforms.
Expertise in machine learning and AI techniques
Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Skilled in working with SQL/NoSQL databases
Experience with version control (Git) and writing clean, maintainable code
Experience with financial datasets, credit scoring, or risk modeling is a strong plus


Not sure you meet evert single requirement? Don’t worry — if this role excites you and you believe you could be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you. At Prestatech, we value potential, curiosity, and passion just as much as experience.

Benefits


Excellent compensation aligned with your experience and impact
A career path that allows you to take yourself to the next level
Annual training budget to help you grow and develop
2 days per week of WFH (+ 3 days at the office)
Flexible working arrangements, with the understanding that building a successful startup sometimes requires periods of focused, intense work
Bi-annual company offsites
Referral bonus
a very nice office in one of the best district of Berlin (Mitte)


Recruitment Process:


HR Interview (30 minutes)
Assessment Test (up to 60 minutes)
CEO/CTO Interview (30 minutes)


If you have any specific requirements or need accommodations during the recruitment process, please let us know — we’re happy to support you.

At Prestatech, we actively embrace diversity and are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming workplace for everyone. Our recruitment process is free from discrimination of any kind — including on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The Team

In the Marketing Analytics team we are focused on improving the effectiveness of our marketing spend and help grow Wolt. We solve a variety of marketing challenges and help optimise Wolt’s marketing mix through attribution, MMM and Experimentation, enabling effective measurement of different marketing initiatives and working with the marketing team to identify areas for improvement and growth across all Wolt countries. Considering the scale of Wolt’s marketing function, there are many exciting problems to be solved and plenty of opportunities to make a business impact.

Data Scientists at Wolt work to uncover insights and turn them into relevant recommendations, driving decisions for the entire organisation. We partner closely with Marketing, Product, Engineering and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics and data science skills to drive business outcomes, we're looking for someone like you.

What you’ll be doing


Use statistical techniques, hypothesis testing, and experimentation to validate findings and drive business outcomes
Provide insights on marketplace dynamics, user behaviors, and long-term trends to our business
Conduct quantitative analysis and present data to uncover business drivers and insights beyond the numbers
Build analytics experiments, reports, and dashboards; perform ad-hoc data analyses using tools like SQL, R, or Python
Identify and measure levers to enhance metrics; make actionable recommendations
Offer clarity in ambiguous environments and collaborate across multiple teams and collaborate effectively across teams, including Marketing, Strategy & Operations, Product, Finance, and Engineering.
Mentor team members towards achieving actionable outcomes


Our humble expectations


5+ years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or related quantitative field
Skills in SQL queries, predictive modeling, and using visualization tools such as Looker or Tableau; experience with Python or R is a plus
Proficiency in experimentation techniques, including causal inference and A/B testing, with experience in experiment design and statistical analysis, with the ability to define success metrics and implement measurement strategies
Experience working closely with Marketing business teams using data to grow the business and familiarity with growth efficiency metrics
A creative and critical mindset, thriving in fast-paced, dynamic environments to resolve ambiguous problems using a structured, hypothesis-driven, and data-supported approach
Strong interpersonal skills, with the ability to work cross-functionally and influence both technical and non-technical audiences and ability to lead strategic projects to completion with cross-functional teams in scrappy environments
Humility and a team-player attitude, going out of your way to help teammates


What we offer


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can work onsite at our offices in Berlin, Helsinki, Stockholm, or Tallinn. Alternatively, you can work remotely anywhere in Germany, Finland, Sweden, or Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote, within the location above. 💙
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to the Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

You’ll join our central AI/ML function, collaborating across departments to drive innovation and enable AI-driven decision-making at scale.

What You’ll Do


Design, develop, and deploy robust machine learning and AI systems for a range of business use cases, including generative AI.
Build and operationalize ML solutions to address business challenges and unlock new opportunities.
Integrate ML and AI models into production systems, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
Deploy and monitor MLOps workflows, including CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, monitoring, and model versioning.
Leverage cloud platforms (AWS + Snowflake) and ML infrastructure (e.g., SageMaker, feature stores) for scalable deployment.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Product, Sales, Marketing, etc.) to deliver AI-driven features and insights.
Ensure all ML/AI solutions adhere to best practices in data privacy, security, and ethical standards.
Contribute to a culture of technical excellence, knowledge sharing, and continuous learning.


What You Need To Succeed


University degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
5+ years’ experience building and deploying production-grade machine learning models.
Strong software engineering mindset — ability to write clean, reusable, and scalable code in Python.
Experience integrating ML/AI models into production software systems.
Solid understanding of MLOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and automated testing frameworks.
Background in data science: comfort with experimentation, A/B testing, and measuring ROI/impact of ML projects (not just accuracy).
Hands-on experience with ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face).
Experience with NLP or generative AI techniques is a strong plus. Familiarity with cloud-based ML infrastructure (AWS, Snowflake, SageMaker, etc.).


Why this role?


Join a newly created AI sprint team focused exclusively on delivering LLM and ML-powered projects with real business impact.
Work in a lean, well-supported environment (dedicated TPM, analytics engineer, and data platform support — no need to build ingestion pipelines).
Full ownership of end-to-end ML delivery: from prototype to production.
Exposure to high-impact use cases (e.g., automating marketing campaigns, personalization engines) backed by executive sponsorship.
A chance to bridge the gap between data science and engineering, bringing cutting-edge AI into production at scale.

          You'll be our Gen AI scout, prototype builder, and client enabler—all in one. We're looking for someone who gets genuinely excited about a new LLM release, can build a working demo before lunch, and explain why it matters—clearly and confidently.

You'll dive into new tools, test ideas fast, shape solution concepts, and help people across the company make smarter, more confident GenAI decisions. From discovery sessions to internal knowledge sharing, you'll be the person turning ""what's new"" into ""what's next.""

We are Inca – a venture-backed startup on a mission to automate insurance claims through Agentic AI.





🚀 We bring Agentic AI to insurance industry with a no-bullshit approach — delivering cutting-edge results, where others overpromise.


🔥 The market is on fire: we’re flooded with inbound interest from insurers eager to transform their claims processes.


🧠 Our team combines former BCG Project Leaders, industry- and AI-experts. Together, we’re redefining how insurances are operating in Europe.


💥 We're backed by top-tier VCs from one of the most competitive InsurTech Pre-Seed rounds in Europe



Tasks



Act as the CEO’s right hand, helping drive all strategic and operational topics


Build the structures, processes, and culture of a rapidly scaling AI company

Help manage relationships with VCs and investors, help steer the next funding rounds


Work hand in hand with our AI product team to align commercial priorities with cutting-edge product development


Shape and evolve our storytelling and messaging for clients, partners, and investors


Own high-impact, high-autonomy strategic projects



Requirements



Drive. Drive. Drive. You take charge, think clearly, and execute with sharpness and commitment.


1–2+ years experience at a Tier A company: VC-backed startup, top consulting firm, investment bank, VC fund, or similar


Structured, analytical mindset: you solve problems and build systems


Entrepreneurial energy: you love ambiguity, building from scratch, and making things happen


Strong communication skills: you pitch, negotiate, and win people over


Curiosity and passion for AI, automation, and transforming traditional industries


Nice to have: Early-stage startup or company building experience; Exposure to AI, SaaS, or B2B enterprise sales; Experience working with investors or C-level stakeholders



Benefits


Why INCA?





🤖 Real AI, real impact: We don’t play AI theater. We build agentic systems that actually work — and transform an industry that’s been asleep for decades.


💥 No bullshit culture: No politics, no empty promises — just clarity, ownership, and results.


🧠 Once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity: Grow with a team of top-tier BCG Project Leaders and AI experts. Full exposure to what it takes to create and scale a venture-backed company.


💸 Highly competitive salary + meaningful equity: You’re not just an employee — you’re an owner.


🌍 Berlin-based, hybrid-friendly, regular offsites


🌴 30 vacation days + 2 weeks work-from-anywhere


⚡ High-speed environment: We move fast, we execute — and we’re here to win

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-5 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €76,000 - €114,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

We’ve sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.




Who we're looking for

We are looking for a highly motivated Data Scientist, who is keen on building advanced predictive models and joining our growing Core Pricing team. The mission is to build a world-class Data Science team that turns ideas and resolves complex challenges into production-grade pricing and risk models effectively, safely, and consistently.




What you’ll do

Explore & analyse large telematics, policy and quote datasets to uncover trends and opportunities
Build and validate statistical & machine learning models that power pricing and risk selection
Collaborate with Engineering, Actuarial and Product to frame business problems and productionise models
Communicate insights clearly through dashboards, visualisations and storytelling
Contribute to best practice in code review, experimentation and shaping our ways of working as you grow




What you’ll bring

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Data Science or related field
Experience: At least 3 years of proven experience as a Data Scientist
Python Proficiency: Strong Python programming skills, with experience in training predictive models. Familiarity with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
SQL: Proficient in SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake
Statistical Methodology: In-depth knowledge of GLMs and other machine learning algorithms
Data Tools: Familiarity with cloud-based data platforms (we’re on AWS) and data visualisation tools (Looker, matplotlib, seaborn)
Software Engineering:
Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) and software development best practices in a data-intensive environment
Care about documentation and reproducibility
Curiosity and a problem-solving mindset
Excellent communication skills, with a proven ability to present complex information in a clear, accessible way




Nice to have (but not essential)

Experience with CI/CD pipelines (we use buildkite and argoCD)
Hands-on experience with insurance pricing tools like Akur8, Emblem or similar pricing modelling tools
Exposure to telematics or usage-based insurance data
Experience with time series analysis and/or graph technologies




What’s it like to work at Zego?

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things.

We’re spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We’re proud of our company and our culture – a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

Together, we’re setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There’s loads of room to learn and grow, and you’ll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you want.

You’ll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren’t afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we’re making insurance matter.




How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid.

Our hybrid way of working is unique. We don't mandate fixed office days. Instead, we foster a flexible approach that empowers every Zegon to perform at their best. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. You have the flexibility to choose the day that works best for you and your team. We cover the costs for all company-wide events (3 per year), and also provide a separate hybrid contribution to help pay towards other travel costs. We think it’s a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.




Our approach to AI

We believe in the power of AI to meaningfully improve how we work - helping us move faster, think differently, and focus on what matters most. At Zego, we encourage people to stay curious and intentional about how AI is leveraged in their work and teams to drive practical impact every day. This is your chance to do the most meaningful work of your career - and we’ll provide you with the tools, support, and freedom to do it well.




Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you’ll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. We also offer an annual flexible hybrid working contribution, which you can use to support with your travel to the office or towards your own personal development. And that’s just for starters.




We’re an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

We believe every decision maker can be empowered by technology. Skyral combines AI, leading edge simulation technology and world class expertise to transform the decision making experience. Our products and services enable faster and more confident decisions in a complex, unforgiving world. We deploy practical, intuitive and efficient solutions to governments and enterprises, delivering outstanding outcomes at the speed of relevance.

What We Do:

We are the Cities team. We build Digital Twins of Cities with a specific focus on providing data analytics not just of the city as-is, but - most importantly - what would happen as a result of a manipulation (answering the question “what if?”) We do so by modelling how population and infrastructure interact in systems such as transport networks and influence the environment, economy, policy, and terrain to allow decision makers to see the possible outcomes of their plans over systems with large geographic scale and complex requirements.

We are a multi-disciplinary team working together to build customer solutions from Core components (including an application development kit, base models that come with the platform, tools to help modellers build models more quickly and tools to help store, manage and process data) and customised data and integrations.

This is a fantastic opportunity for an individual who is early in their Data Science career or has recently completed a relevant PhD. We are looking to help develop individuals who have a keen interest in Traffic/Transport and/or Population/Behavioural modelling. As well as the work that we carry out for Urban Digital Twins, you will gain exposure to our projects relating to Defence and National Security.

Please note that due to the nature of this role, we can only consider applications from individuals who meet the criteria for Government SC Security Clearance.

What We Are Looking For:



You have experience with one or more of the following: human behavior modelling, crowd dynamics, social modelling, information dynamics, social media modelling, transport modelling, logistics modelling
Proficiency with Python is essential
Experience with geospatial data is a strong advantage
An understanding of agent-based modelling approaches
You have previously implemented models either by yourself or by closely collaborating with engineers
You have a degree in a STEM subject with a significant mathematical component. A PhD is not required but is an advantage





We You Will Be Responsible For:



Creating scientific models for our solutions as well as being hands-on in the process of model implementation
Working with delivery teams to interpret technical requirements and formulate them into scientifically defensible products
Delivering prototype and production-level implementations of model tooling as notebooks and code
Critically evaluating the results of simulations and presenting these back to key stakeholders and decision makers, while adapting your communication style to the relevant audience
Telling a story with the data from our products and simulations, remaining pragmatic about their limitations and providing a realistic view to colleagues, stakeholders and clients of the benefits and risks inherent to data-driven decision making
Spending time with our customers to understand their perspectives and inform their thinking as we create new products





At Skyral, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equality and inclusion. We also ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to reasonable adjustments. If you require such accommodations during the job application process we ask that you inform a member of our talent team.

We are a rapidly growing startup developing solutions that blend human expertise and AI agents to handle manual customer and marketplace operations tasks. Our unique approach combines the strengths of human expertise (high accuracy and nuanced decision-making) with the advantages of AI automation (speed and cost efficiency). This cutting-edge technology helps businesses solve real-world challenges in trust & safety and beyond without complex technical integration. We believe in an online world free from harm, where we can trust AI to make safe and fair decisions.

We have raised about $25M in VC funding from top tier funds including Creandum and Plural, and operate at significant scale - analysing millions of daily images and videos. But we are just at the beginning of our journey - and we are very excited about our plans for growth over the coming year and beyond!

The role

We are now looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to build and deliver innovative AI products to our customers. Your software expertise and machine learning knowledge will help transform our customers' manual processes into AI automated solutions.

Your mission will be to ensure our customers receive the most effective AI solutions for their specific needs. You will apply your technical and analytical skills to understand customer challenges and collaborate with them to leverage our AI in the automation of their work. Initially, you will provide hands-on support for our machine learning models as they come to market but then will gradually develop self-service tools that empower customers to achieve value independently.

As part of this role, you will:


Collaborate with customers to thoroughly understand their workflows, then design and build AI agents that automate their processes
Contribute to the development of our AI agent development platform that scales with our product strategy
Ensure our AI services maintain high standards of reliability, observability, availability, and performance
Participate in our machine learning community to influence how we implement machine learning and computer vision technologies, shaping Unitary's future
Take ownership of customer outcomes with the autonomy to make decisions that surprise and delight our customers
Contribute full-stack development including software engineering, DevOps, and MLOps, along with light task and project management to ensure your AI solutions deliver maximum value


Requirements

You

We are looking for someone who is as excited about Unitary's mission as we are, who wants to have a large impact at an early-stage startup, and be a key part of defining Unitary's future as one of our early employees. We need versatile people who are happy to get stuck into whatever needs doing, and are ready to learn and grow with the company.

For this particular role, we need a proactive software engineering expert who is familiar with using AI tooling and prompt engineering, and who is comfortable engaging with customers and exploring and presenting new ideas. Strong communication skills are essential, as you'll lead technical deliveries and bring others along on the journey. You embrace a product mindset in everything you do and should demonstrate a genuine curiosity for solving current and future customer challenges.

We would love to hear from you if you:


Have strong Python and engineering skills, with experience using and applying AI to solve customer problems
Can (or want to learn to) develop agentic AI systems that can automate human processes
Have an understanding of (or want to learn) how software is deployed through Kubernetes, and with the capability to deploy some infrastructure elements independently
Can demonstrate problem solving and project management skills in order to analyse workflows and design automated solutions
Thrive in a collaborative environment where group output and team achievements weigh heavier than individual input
Can travel to our company-wide offsites three times per year


It would be even better, but not essential, if you have:


Experience working in a fully remote, international team
Previous startup experience
A background in building and operating agentic AI systems
Experience with MLOps practices and tools, and monitoring machine learning systems in production
Knowledge of CI/CD practices and tools such as GitLab CI, Argo CD
Proficiency with SQL and NoSQL databases
Worked with Kubernetes and infrastructure as code (IaC) tools such as Terraform
Experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and a keen interest in staying current with the latest AI technology advancements


This role will report to the VP of Engineering and can be placed anywhere within 3 hours of the UK time zone.

Benefits

The Team

Unitary is a remote-first team of c. 20 people spread across Europe and North America who are fiercely passionate about making the internet a safer place, and deeply motivated to become a force for good.

Built in-house at Octopus Energy, we took them to become the biggest supplier in the UK, and now we power energy companies and utilities around the globe - in 10 countries and counting, licensing software to giants like Origin Energy in Australia and Tokyo Gas in Japan. We’re on a mission to accelerate the renewable transition, and bring affordable green energy to the world.




We’ve reinvented energy products with smart, data driven tariffs to balance customer demand with renewable generation, and Kraken’s platform controls more than half of the grid-scale batteries in the UK. We’re driving the uptake of low carbon technologies like solar panels and heat pumps via our software for engineers in the field. Our platform allows our energy specialists to be the most productive in the industry, with our suite of AI tools making us pioneers in using ML and AI to make agents' lives easier and customers happier. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.




Our ML team consists of ML, front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative tools in use at breakneck speed. 







We’ve had great success in using AI to bring better service to customers, and we want to bring that success to the whole business. You’ll be part of a small expert team working on the most pressing problems for the business, whether it’s internal AI tooling to make our developers twice as productive, or automating processes to cut months off migration times for new clients. You’ll work across the whole product lifecycle: identifying uses of new technologies via exploration, working closely with teams around the business to validate that your ideas will bring value, and rapidly prototyping. The work you do will define the pattern for AI success at the company.




You’ll have wide open problems to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, figuring out an approach and validating it fast. You’ll stay up to date with changes in the field, using your knowledge of state-of-the-art techniques to solve problems. LLMs will be your bread and butter, customized with advanced RAG techniques, finetuning and reinforcement learning. You’ll work closely with other engineers to build fast, and you’ll use Python and Kubernetes to deploy systems in production.




What you'll do
Work with a high performance team of LLM, MLOps, backend and front end engineers
Tackle the biggest problems facing the company, giving a wide experience across the business, with the freedom to define novel approaches
Work to help LLMs understand and interact with the millions of lines of code that run Kraken, leveraging techniques at the cutting-edge of the technology like GraphRAG, agentic workflows, finetuning, and reinforcement learning
Use classic ML and NLP techniques to complement and improve LLM systems
Act as a center of excellence for the whole business in AI, as a floating resource that consults other teams use of LLMs and lifts the quality of products around the whole business
Be on the forefront of understanding AI advancements and their technical implications for the team and business






What you'll need
Curious and self driven - in a field that changes so quickly, its essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
1+ year experience with LLMs in production beyond POC and a deep technical understanding of diverse technologies and techniques to adapt LLMs to domains (like advanced RAG techniques, tool calling, finetuning and RL) Of particular interest are cutting-edge AI systems in software engineering, for example working on AI software copilots or autonomous software engineering bots
3+ years experience of traditional ML techniques including training and deploying non-LLM ML models, and ongoing monitoring of production models that incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve 
A keen interest in Gen AI and classic ML, understanding of emerging trends and research, and proven experience aligning and applying this to real world objectives





It would be great if you had
Experience working with large codebases and collaborating with multiple engineering teams in large companies
Experience in diverse LLM deployment methods (eg hosted finetuned models via services like Bedrock, and running directly via engines like vLLM)

Immersive Gamebox (IGB) is a fast-growing entertainment company bringing multiplayer gaming experiences to global audiences. With 30+ venues across the UK, US, and beyond, we partner with leading studios like Netflix, Sony, WB, and Paramount to create world-class interactive content using cutting-edge technology.




Role Description

This is a full-time role for an Applied Data Scientist (Strategy & Analytics), based in London. You will be at the heart of IGB’s decision-making, turning data into clear insights and strategies that drive growth across pricing, marketing, content, and venue expansion.




As an Applied Data Scientist your primary job will be using data to answer crucial questions such as:




What is the price elasticity of our customers?
How can we optimise a seven-figure paid media budget?
Which markets should we enter next, and how can we map them using spatial analysis?
Which marketing initiatives are driving genuine incremental impact?
What is the causal lift of new game launches on revenue, and which games should we pick next?
How should we forecast revenue and model new initiatives to guide planning?
What dashboards will sharpen KPIs and support investor and board decisions?




But this is a start-up: priorities shift, opportunities emerge, and you’ll need the initiative to ask your own questions and pursue the analyses you believe will move the needle.




Who you are

We’re building the future of immersive entertainment and need an applied data scientist who thrives on turning data into strategic decisions that drive growth.
A personable, concise communicator who goes beyond presenting results – able to think critically about insights, translate them into recommendations, and judge when deep analysis is needed versus structured, decisive thinking.
Confident in testing bold ideas, taking calculated risks, and being accountable for outcomes – with decisions that have an immediate and visible impact on revenue.

Thoughtful

Thoughtful at Iso is about curiosity, creativity and care. It is about good people doing good, rigorous and future-making science every single day.

Brave

Brave at Iso is about fearlessness, but it’s also about initiative and integrity. The scale of the challenge demands nothing less.

Determined

Determined at Iso is the way we pursue our goal. It’s a confidence in our hypothesis, as well as the urgency and agility needed to deliver on it. Because disease won’t wait, so neither should we.

Together

Together at Iso is about connection, collaboration across fields and catalytic relationships. It’s knowing that transformation is a group project, and remembering that what we’re doing will have a real impact on real people everywhere.

Creating An Extraordinary Company

We believe that to be successful we need a team with a range of skills and talents. We're building an environment where collaboration is fundamental, learning is shared and every employee feels supported and able to thrive. We value unique experiences, knowledge, backgrounds, and perspectives, and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact.

We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Hybrid working

It’s hugely important for us to share knowledge and build strong relationships with each other, and we find it easier to do this if we spend time together in person. This is why we follow a hybrid model, and would require you to be able to come into the office 3 days a week (currently Tuesday, Wednesday, and one other day depending on which team you’re in). If you have additional needs that would prevent you from following this hybrid approach, we’d be happy to talk through these if you’re selected for an initial screening call.

We’re creating cocoa-free chocolate that looks, melts and tastes like the real thing, while avoiding the ethical, social and environmental issues linked to cocoa. We use low-carbon, abundant ingredients, proprietary fermentation and standard chocolate manufacturing equipment to make award-winning vegan m.lk, milk and dark “easy-melt” buttons for B2B partners.




The role




You’ll help develop the next generation of our cocoa-free chocolate, from first formulations through to products ready for scale-up. It’s a practical role with lots of hands-on time in the lab, close collaboration with Operations and Sales, and regular sensory work to make sure our products deliver on taste, texture and functionality. You’ll have day-to-day responsibility for maintaining high food hygiene standards on site, ensuring compliance with HACCP and other food safety requirements, and keeping clear, detailed records of your work. You’ll use statistical and data science approaches to interpret product testing results to ensure decisions are evidence-based.




What you’ll do




Formulate and prototype new cocoa-free chocolate products, with a focus on flavour, texture and shelf life
Recruit, train and run sensory panels, and evaluate panel data to guide decision making
Collaborate with Operations on scale-up and with Sales on customer applications and customisation
Take responsibility for food hygiene and safety standards on site, including HACCP compliance
Maintain accurate documentation, batch records and testing data




What you’ll bring




BSc and MSc in Food Science, Food Chemistry or a related field
3+ years in product development, ideally in chocolate, confectionery, plant-based or sensory-led categories
Strong understanding of ingredient functionality, sensory science and flavour chemistry
Experience with data science and statistical analysis for sensory and product testing
HACCP Level 3 or higher, with practical experience applying food safety systems
A practical, collaborative approach and an interest in sustainable food innovation




If you don’t meet every single point but have relevant skills and motivation, we’d still like to hear from you.




How we work




This role is based in our London lab and office with at least 4 days per week on site. Occasional travel may be required.




Salary and benefits




£39,000–£45,000 per year, depending on experience, plus performance-based incentives
Professional development and opportunities to grow with a rapidly scaling company
A collaborative, inclusive workplace that values different perspectives and creativity
A vibrant office in the centre of East London with a barista-level coffee machine and great snacks
The chance to contribute to a more sustainable and ethical food system




Right to work




Applicants must already have the right to work in the UK. Unfortunately, we cannot offer visa sponsorship for this role, and applications from candidates who require sponsorship cannot be considered.

Your title will be Staff AI Engineer
This role pays £170k + a year + generous stock options
Matt, Cofounder and CTO, is the hiring manager
We work Mon-Thu in our office in Chancery Lane, London, Fri from anywhere




What are we building?

Cursor built a $500m ARR business that predicts the next code change a software engineer wants to make. Why is there not a $500m ARR business that predicts the next email a salesperson wants to send? That's the business we've set out to build. The market is 10x bigger. Most of the modern economy is services - think real estate agents, recruiters, salespeople, insurance brokers, marketing agencies. And these people spend most of their time in email, doing admin: keeping their inbox organised, scheduling meetings, replying to repetitive emails, sending follow ups.

The goal is wide open. Big tech has failed to build anything useful for this type of customer, and there isn't a startup we know that's doing this that even has $1m ARR.

Since launching in April 2024, we've gone from $0 to $16m in ARR and raised a $30m Series B from top investors.


That's because we deeply understand the domain. Two of our cofounders, Rich and Archie, spent 8 years running an executive assistant agency, providing a manual service for what we're now automating using AI.


Email is an incredibly hard problem, and we've spent the past 18 months building all the pieces we need to succeed:

Training data: We've assembled a world class human data division, composed of annotators that have experience at the world's top AI labs and model providers, to provide the training data for our models. And we've learned the playbook to get the most out of them
Context: To predict the next email someone will send, you need to deeply understand their work. We've built battle tested, production grade integrations with our users' emails, meetings, documentation and messaging (slack etc) to do this. And have fine tuned models that read these and decide what makes it into our knowledge base
Feedback loop: No thumbs up thumbs down. We've developed an incredibly strong feedback loop that tells us whether a change we've made to our system works. Down to the word, and even character
Tools: There's lots of hype around generative AI. Different models coming out every day, new techniques. We've sorted the signal from the noise by experimenting with tools in production, to find what actually works. As a result, we know which base models to use, when and how to fine tune, when to use workflows vs agents, how to build the best RAG pipeline, etc. And we're refining our learning every day



We're hiring a Staff AI Engineer to assemble all these foundations into something truly exceptional. Our goal is to predict the next email a salesperson will send 100% of the time.

What do we value?



Ownership

Each of our engineers owns a business area end to end. You'll be given a metric to optimise, and it's up to you to define the strategy to move that metric, as well as execute against it. We have no product managers and have no plans for that to change.

You'll be increasing the percentage of our draft content that gets sent.

Speed

We're very intentional about adding new people. We think a small team of exceptional people working hard at a problem they care about will always beat a larger, less focused team. That does mean you'll need to bring an intensity to this role that might not be asked at other companies. But it also means you will be fast tracked into more senior roles and responsibilities far earlier.


What will I do?



You'll be increasing the percentage of our draft content that gets sent. Here's what we think will move that metric:

Jumping on calls with customers, and getting them to narrate their thoughts to you as they work through your email, giving you ideas for what we should build into the system to improve our performance
Using the above to define what models we need to build, and how they should fit within the wider system
Designing strategies to validate and troubleshoot the accuracy of each model step you design, as well as the accuracy of the whole system, and feedback the learnings to the product engineering team, and human data division. Whether using LLM evals or deterministic code
Working with product reliability engineers to improve the quality of our raw email, meeting, document and messaging data
Architecting the structure of our knowledge base, how we save down to it, and how we retrieve from it
Working with our human data team to get them to produce training and validation sets for those models, and checking data quality
Working out where we need human data vs synthetic data


What does our ideal hire look like?


You're truly obsessed with harnessing LLMs, agentic systems, and retrieval to achieve real world results, and have spent disproportionate time improving your understanding over the last 3 years, both in your day job, and in side projects
You have an expert level understanding of Typescript or Python, so that you can implement your ideas
You have experience architecting and evaluating generative AI systems, working with some of the following:
LLM evals
Deterministic code based evals
Vector database indexing and retrieval
Fine tuning (supervised and direct preference optimisation)
Interaction with human data teams
Experimentation frameworks
Urgency and intensity in your work. This is very hard problem, and will require disproportionate effort from you
Proactivity. This isn't a role where you'll be handed tickets. You'll be deciding how our AI system for predicting email replies develops alongside our CTO, with scope to change pretty much anything. You'll only be successful if you gain an understanding of the problem at a deep level by talking to customers and looking at individual data points, then continually update your knowledge on cutting edge approaches to applied generative AI


Our tech stack



Broadly, we use a fairly typical serverless Typescript stack. It's not a requirement to have worked with every tool in this stack, but the more the better!

Typescript for all production code
Pinecone as our vector database
APIs into the models of all major providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Llama, Anthropic) for both fine tuning and inference
Our custom human data and ML ops platform
Vercel's agents SDK
Firestore as our production database
Firebase Auth as our auth system
Backend deployed on Firebase Functions, and making use of PubSub and Cloud Storage
BigQuery as our data warehouse
Sentry and Google Cloud Logging for monitoring
Github Actions for CI/CD


The application process


Submit your CV (no need for a cover letter)
An initial call with someone from the Fyxer AI team to review your experience and motivation for joining (15 mins)

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

We are a Toronto-based technology company transforming inspection workflows in high-stakes environments, starting with airfields. Our flagship platform, InspectEx, integrates data from multiple sensors (visible, thermal, LiDAR, GPS, IMU) to detect issues such as foreign object debris, pavement surface conditions, lighting faults, and non-compliant snowbanks in real time. We automatically log inspection data, deliver actionable alerts, and provide insights that help organizations operate more safely, efficiently, and intelligently.




Who We're Looking For

We’re looking for a pragmatic, resourceful ML Engineer to join our startup team. This role isn’t about chasing perfect models, it’s about shipping effective solutions that solve real industrial problems and make airfields safer, smarter, and more efficient.




We want people who are fast learners, independent thinkers, and natural problem-solvers. If you thrive in ambiguity, can ship production ML under real-world constraints, and believe communication is as important as code then you’ll fit right in.




What You'll Do

Design, build, and deploy ML models, with emphasis on computer vision.
Drive the ML lifecycle (data collection/creation, preprocessing, storage, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring) in collaboration with our VP Engineering and Technical Artists.
Optimize models for edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) and cloud platforms.
Translate messy operational challenges into clear, technical solutions.
Ship fast: deliver a simple, working solution in weeks, then improve it.
Share openly. We succeed as a team, not as siloed researchers.




What You Bring

3+ years of professional, hands-on ML and software development experience. Academic projects are fine, but we hire people who have shipped and maintained live systems.
Proven production deployment. You’ve dealt with performance, scaling, and things breaking in the field, not just benchmarks in a lab.
Strong communicator. Clear communication is a core technical skill. You can explain trade-offs, set expectations, and build trust across teams.
Problem-solver’s mindset. You’re curious, adaptable, and driven to find the fastest path to real value.
Technical foundation. Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, solid ML theory, software engineering fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, testing).
Degree in CS, Engineering, or related field.




Bonus Points For:

Exposure to AI for autonomous driving and sensor fusion is a big plus. For example, BEVFusion or V2XFusion models, or Kalman filtering for location estimation.
MLOps tools + cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).
C++ for ML/CV libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV).
Point-cloud (e.g. LiDAR) or database (e.g. SQL) experience.




Compensation & Benefits

Salary: $115,000–$145,000 CAD, based on experience.
Equity: Meaningful participation in our plan.
Vacation: 3 weeks to start, 4 in year 2, 5 in year 3.
Purpose Leave: 30 days off every two years at 75% pay.
Flexibility: Remote-first, flexible hours.




Our Interview Process

We value your time and aim for a transparent and efficient process:




Phone screen (30 min): Background + project discussion.
Technical interview (Karat): 1-on-1 tailored interview focused on problem-solving & coding.
Leadership interview (90 min): Project presentation & discussion + team fit.




Illuminex AI is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive, supportive, and kind environment for all employees.

CSC Generation is on a mission to build the most advanced AI-driven retail operating system in the industry. Our brands—including Sur La Table, One Kings Lane, and Backcountry—rely on fast, intelligent decision-making rooted in high-integrity data.

We’re hiring an AI-First Data Scientist who combines deep statistical and machine learning expertise with modern MLOps tooling and automation instincts. You will design and deploy production-ready ML solutions, leveraging cutting-edge platforms like AWS Sagemaker, Vertiv, and advanced causal inference techniques such as Double Machine Learning (DML). Your work will not just inform decisions—it will automate, scale, and embed intelligence directly into our operating systems.

This is a highly technical, hands-on role with direct business impact. You’ll be embedded with senior operators and report directly to a brand CEO or platform leader, supporting mission-critical decisions and creating AI systems that improve themselves over time.




What You Get to Do Every Day

Lead the end‑to‑end ML lifecycle—from problem framing and data preparation through model training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
Build reliable data pipelines and features; ensure data quality, reproducibility, documentation, and auditability, on cloud-native platforms (e.g. AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI)
Develop predictive and causal models; design experiments to quantify impact and guide decision‑making.
Apply modern MLOps practices (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, CI/CD, observability) to keep models robust and maintainable.
Translate model outputs into clear recommendations; partner with stakeholders to drive adoption and iterate based on results.
Collaborate with engineering and product on secure integration, performance, and cost‑efficiency.
Continuously research and apply emerging techniques in AI, including generative AI, automated feature engineering, and reinforcement learning.




What You Bring to the Role

5+ years’ experience in applied data science/ML with a track record of deploying models to production.
Bachelor’s or Master’s in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, or related quantitative field.
Proficiency in Python and SQL; strong software engineering practices (version control, testing, reproducibility).
Experience with cloud‑based ML workflows and processing data at scale.
Familiarity with MLOps concepts (experiment tracking, model registry/monitoring, automated deployment, CI/CD).
Experience across predictive, time‑series, and causal modeling; ability to design experiments, A/B testing, and interpret impact.
Excellent communication: able to present complex work to non‑technical stakeholders and drive action.
Curiosity and a bias for building autonomous, decision‑supporting systems.




Why This Role is Different

Most data scientist roles focus on building models that live in notebooks. This one takes those models all the way to production—where they shape decisions in real time.

You won’t just be running experiments—you’ll be building the future of how our business thinks and operates. You’ll integrate AI directly into decision loops, create reusable data science products, and champion a culture of AI-first thinking across the organization.




What’s in it for you? Joining CSC Generation isn’t just about having a seat at the table—it’s about helping redesign the table entirely. You’ll be challenged, stretched, and supported as you grow faster than you thought possible. In addition to competitive compensation, we offer:

Executive Access: Work directly with brand CEOs and senior leadership, solving real business problems and earning mentorship from top operators.
AI-First Skill Building: Get hands-on with the most advanced AI tools in the market. From automation to prompt engineering, you’ll build a modern tech stack that sets you apart in any industry.
Accelerated Career Path: High performers are quickly entrusted with greater responsibility, new challenges, and leadership opportunities across our portfolio of brands.
Competitive benefits: Paid time off policies, 401(k)/RRSP match, medical/dental/vision and a variety of supplemental policies, and employee discounts at our portfolio companies

What our interview process looks like:

📞 Step 1: If you align with our vision and meet the qualifications, we’ll reach out to schedule a conversation and introduce CSC.
🧠 Step 2: You’ll complete a short AI or product-building challenge so we can understand how you approach problems and execution.
💬 Step 3: Participate in deep-dive interviews with CSC leadership focused on your experience, product mindset, and operational thinking.
📩 Step 4: Offer. We’ll move fast for the right candidate.

Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.

Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.

We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 6, including 5 engineers hailing from Yale, University of Toronto, UCLA, and more; and 1 designer. We’re a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.

We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.

What You’ll Do

As an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You’ll be expected to:


Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.)
Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it!
Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web.
Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested.
Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows.
Review code written by other engineers.
Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt.


This position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.

What You Might Work On


New, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier.
AI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention.
Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones.
A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels.
Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them.
A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.


You May Be a Good Fit If You


Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native.
Are a product person: you’ve built products end-to-end before, and really care about the people who use them.
Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too.
Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats.
Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.


What’s it like to work here?

We’re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel’s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.

Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.

We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.

Our hiring process

We’ll first have you do 2 short rounds of asynchronous programming challenges, including one with a virtual interviewer. After that, we’ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language with one of the founders, followed by a half-day final-round virtual onsite via video call.

Founders

Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive.

Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.

Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier!

By transforming muon data into reliable 3D density maps, Ideon helps geologists identify, map, characterize, and monitor mineral deposits with confidence. This reduces risk and cost of traditional methods, while saving time, optimizing return, and minimizing environmental impact across the mining value chain. In turn, this is helping accelerate the world’s transition to low-impact mining and transform how companies recover the critical minerals required to power the global shift to clean energy – improving peoples’ lives and enhancing economic prosperity.

Ideon’s salary ranges are determined by role and level and are benchmarked against companies of similar size and stage in the Vancouver, BC, Canada market. The range reflects the minimum and maximum new employee salary. It is not typical for a new employee to be hired at the top of the range; as experienced as someone may be they likely won’t have the directly related experience unique to working at Ideon. In exceptional circumstances, though, where a person has the knowledge, skills, and experience to exceed those needed for the position, we may consider compensating at the top of the range. In the application process you will be asked to provide your salary expectations.

          <p>Founded and based in Richmond, BC, <strong>Ideon Technologies </strong>uses the energy from supernova explosions in space to image deep beneath the Earth’s surface.&nbsp;The&nbsp;world pioneer in cosmic-ray muon tomography, Ideon has developed the REVEAL™ Subsurface Intelligence Platform™, comprising an advanced suite of proprietary data-generation hardware, software, AI-powered services, and multi-physics fusion that provide x-ray-like visibility deep underground and unlock the exponential power of integrated spatial data.</p><p><br></p><p>By transforming muon data into reliable 3D density maps, Ideon helps geologists identify, map, characterize, and monitor mineral deposits with confidence. This reduces risk and cost of traditional methods, while saving time, optimizing return, and minimizing environmental impact across the mining value chain. In turn, this is helping accelerate the world’s transition to low-impact mining and transform how companies recover the critical minerals required to power the global shift to clean energy – improving peoples’ lives and enhancing economic prosperity.

Picture your favorite boutique in town — we help them discover the best products from around the world to sell in their stores. With the right tools and insights, we believe that we can level the playing field so that small businesses everywhere can compete with these big box and e-commerce giants.

By supporting the growth of independent businesses, Faire is driving positive economic impact in local communities, globally. We’re looking for smart, resourceful and passionate people to join us as we power the shop local movement. If you believe in community, come join ours.

About The Role

As an Applied AI/ML Scientist on the Search Group, you’ll work with world-class machine learning scientists to execute the ML algorithm strategy and system design powering one of the most critical levers for customer value and company growth—Search. You’ll collaborate on the advancement of real-time Search and Recommendation systems behind our next-generation shopping experiences.

You’ll operate at the forefront of algorithms—combining large language models, natural-language processing, query understanding, deep learning, transformer-based sequential modeling, graph neural networks, and structured behavioral data to return hyper-relevant, personalized products and brands for any given query.

This is a rare opportunity to work on end-to-end Search/Recommendation in a high-scale, deeply multi-modal environment, where we bring together the top talents from companies including Google, Meta, Amazon, LinkedIn, Uber, Airbnb, Salesforce, Twitter, Square, Pinterest, Instacart, and Coupang.

What You’ll Do

Contribute to the next-generation Search engine, integrating LLMs, query understanding, dense vector retrieval, deep personalization embeddings, multi-stage ranking, and reinforcement learning to serve personalized product feeds with <100 ms latency.
Design and productionize natural-language search and discovery systems, enabling intelligent agents to generate relevant and personalized collections, explain search results, and assist retailers in browsing, filtering, and evaluation.
Collaborate on model development and GPU-based deployment efforts, leveraging frameworks like Triton to scale inference reliably and efficiently.


You’re a Great Fit If You Have…


1-3 years of industry or research experience using machine learning to solve real-world problems, ideally including work in search, recommendations, or ads ranking.
Hands-on experience with deep-learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch) and vector-search infrastructure (e.g., Faiss, ScaNN, Pinecone).
A strong track record of productionizing models that blend LLMs (e.g., BERT, GPT-class) with structured features to drive personalization.
A product-focused mindset and a bias toward execution—you move quickly from paper to prototype to production.
Strong Python skills, deep respect for system reliability and ownership, and experience operating in high-stakes environments.
Excellent communication and cross-functional influence—you raise the technical bar beyond your immediate team.


Bonus Points For…


Contributions to open-source ML libraries or peer-reviewed publications in ML/AI.
MS or PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, or a related STEM field.

Our agentic AI platform brings ""AI employees"" into the workplace to take over the repetitive, soul-crushing workflows that slow teams down. The result: organizations move faster, with sharper focus, and deliver better outcomes where it matters most, like improving patient care.

The shift to agentic work is inevitable, and we’re leading it. We've scaled from $0 -> $XM ARR in 3 months with our agentic product, and we're looking for AI Prompt Engineers to help us reach $XXM ARR in the next 9 months. As a founding Prompt Engineer at Magical, you will play a critical role in bridging the gap between our cutting-edge AI automation platform and our customers’ needs. You’ll work directly with customers, helping them deploy, integrate, and optimize Magical’s solutions to drive business value. This role requires a blend of technical knowledge, problem-solving, customer engagement, and product customization to ensure the customer’s seamless adoption, success, and expansion over time.

We're backed by the investors behind OpenAI, Anthropic, Huggingface, and Notion, including Greylock, Coatue, and Lightspeed. The runway is long. The ambition is high. And the market is wide open.

What You’ll Do


Build custom workflow configurations via AI prompting and internal tools to extend Magical’s capabilities for specific customer use cases.
Provide technical guidance and best practices to customers, ensuring smooth onboarding and adoption.
Build relationships with customers to understand their workflow challenges and design tailored AI-powered automation solutions using Magical’s platform.
Deploy, configure, and integrate Magical’s automation technology with customer environments, including CRMs, EHRs and loan origination systems.
Act as the technical liaison between customers and Magical’s product and engineering teams, capturing feedback and driving improvements.
Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues related to deployments, integrations, and performance optimization.
Be a vocal member, helping the engineering team build internal tools and documentation to streamline future customer implementations.
Identify opportunities for customers to expand their use of Magical’s platform, upselling additional solutions and driving account growth.


Who You Are


3+ years of experience in engineering, solutions engineering, QA engineering, or similar technical background
Deep AI prompting proficiency
A top project manager. You can wrangle something fuzzy into a project plan and you’ll do whatever is needed to make it happen
Familiarity with business process automation, workflow optimization, or AI-driven solutions is a plus
Ability to manage multiple projects, engage with senior stakeholders, and communicate technical concepts in a clear and structured manner.
Willingness and ability to travel to customer sites as required for setup and implementation.
A self-starter with a strong ability to adapt, learn quickly, and thrive in a fast-paced, startup environment.


Who We Are

At Magical, we empower organizations to automate the complex, manual workflows that are essential to their operations. These workflows are the backbone of industries that keep the world running, yet many organizations remain burdened by resource constraints and outdated manual processes, hindering their efficiency and innovation.

Magical leverages AI and a purpose-built workflow automation platform to seamlessly transform long-form, multi-system workflows into fully autonomous processes. We enable teams to scale operations, reduce costs, and focus on what matters most.

Backed by leading investors, including Coatue, Greylock, Lightspeed and Bain Capital Ventures, Magical is reimagining the future of work by equipping teams with the tools to unlock hidden inefficiencies, automate with precision and achieve unprecedented operational scale.

Employment Type: Full-time

Seniority: Intermediate–Senior (open to PhD new grads with strong portfolios)

Industry: Medical Devices • Digital Health • Neuroscience

Functions: Research • Data Science • Machine Learning




About the Role

We’re looking for an AI researcher who lives at the intersection of brain biosignals and machine learning. You’ll turn raw signals (EEG, fNIRS, HR/HRV, PPG, motion) into robust, clinically meaningful insights—building models that detect cognitive states, track recovery, and quantify intervention effects. If you enjoy end-to-end work—from study design and data curation to modeling, deployment, and publications—this is for you.




What You’ll Do
Own the biosignal ML pipeline: preprocessing (filtering, ICA/ASR, artifact handling), feature engineering (time/frequency/time–frequency, connectivity), and model training (classical ML + deep learning).
Model development: sequence and time-series models (CNN/RNN/Temporal CNN/Transformers), self-supervised/contrastive learning, domain adaptation, and multimodal fusion (EEG + HRV/PPG/fNIRS).
Experimental design & analysis: collaborate with clinicians/researchers on protocols, labeling strategies, power analyses, and statistical validation.
Deploy & iterate: productionize models (Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow), manage experiments (MLflow/W&B), build eval dashboards, and monitor drift.
Publish & communicate: contribute to whitepapers, posters, or manuscripts; present findings to internal stakeholders and external partners.
Compliance & privacy: follow IRB/REB processes and PHIPA/HIPAA-aligned data governance (de-identification, consent, data lifecycle).




What You’ll Bring
Background: MSc/PhD in CS, EE, Biomedical Engineering, Neuroscience, or similar; or equivalent applied experience.
Biosignal expertise: hands-on EEG (preferred) and at least one of fNIRS/PPG/HRV/ECG/EMG. Comfortable with MNE-Python (or EEGLAB), signal QA, and artifact mitigation.
ML toolkit: strong Python, NumPy/Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch or TensorFlow/JAX; time-series DL, cross-validation, stats, and error analysis.
Software practices: Git, code reviews, reproducible research, containers (Docker), and at least one cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).
Communication: clear writing, strong data storytelling, and ability to translate research into product impact.




Nice-to-Haves
Foundation/self-supervised models for time series; representation learning for biosignals.
Graph/functional-connectivity modeling, source localization basics.
MLOps (Kubernetes, batch/real-time inference), edge ML.
Clinical or regulated device experience (ISO 13485/62304 awareness).
Publications or open-source contributions (please share links).




Why Join Us
Impact: help define biomarkers and algorithms that move the needle in brain health and performance.
Data access: multimodal datasets (EEG ± fNIRS/PPG/HRV), real-world deployments, and research collaborations.
Growth: publish, attend conferences, and lead projects end-to-end in a fast-moving, supportive team.




Compensation & Work Setup
Salary: Competitive; CAD $–$ + benefits + potential performance bonus (fill in).
Schedule: Hybrid in Toronto (2–3 days on site); flexible hours.
Start date: As soon as available.




How to Apply

Please apply on LinkedIn and include:

CV or LinkedIn profile, 2) short note on your most relevant biosignal project, 3) links to GitHub/papers/demos, and 4) earliest start date.
(Optional) Email: dominic@vielight.com
with subject “AI Researcher – Biosignals”.
