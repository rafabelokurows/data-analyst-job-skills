Job Description

We are on a lookout for a hands-on Senior Data Scientist-Generative AI & Agents to join the Vendor Data Team on our journey to always deliver amazing experiences and go beyond prompt engineering into autonomous orchestration: designing agents that generate their own prompts, tools that empower AI with real-world actions, and judge models that validate outputs. Your work won’t sit in research notebooks — it’ll ship.

The Agentic AI team is building the next generation of AI-native products — intelligent systems that reason, act, and adapt. We combine the power of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to move beyond static prompts and chatbots into dynamic AI systems that solve real problems at scale. We don’t treat LLMs as tools to micromanage — we treat them as collaborators. Our products are designed to build and evolve themselves, leveraging AI to orchestrate workflows, make decisions, and continuously improve. If you’re ready to stop building brittle bots and start building AI that builds AI — this is your playground.


Architect and deploy agent-based systems using LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom frameworks
Build and optimize RAG pipelines — from smart chunking to embeddings and vector search - Fine-tune and evaluate LLMs for reliability, relevance, and factuality
Design evolving prompt and memory systems driven by LLMs and user feedback
Implement simulation and feedback loops using judge models or agent testing harnesses
Partner cross-functionally with product, research, and engineering teams
Stay current with the latest research in LLMs, generative modeling, and agent systems


Qualifications


Machine learning fundamentals (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning) - Data wrangling and preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
LLMs and NLP expertise (Transformers, BERT, GPT, etc.
Prompt engineering & fine-tuning
Knowledge of tokenization, embeddings, and attention mechanism
Using and fine-tuning Hugging Face models
Evaluation metrics for generative models (BLEU, ROUGE, faithfulness, hallucination detection)


Nice to have:


Open-source model experience (LLaMA3, Mistral, Mixtral) or custom inference stacks - Judge models, feedback loops, or synthetic user testing architectures
Familiarity with prompt injection defenses, output validation, or agent safety
Experience deploying generative AI in web or mobile products
Academic or industry background in statistics, cognitive science, or human-AI interaction

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

About The Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has earned Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years, we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app, we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team, working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

What You’ll Be Doing

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on identifying opportunities to optimize an in-house tool developed for support operations to resolve customer queries by identifying support ops needs, building supporting KPI & dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for product improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine product roadmap & automation capabilities.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track customer journey through the support, time to resolve queries and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation, and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communication skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in event tracking and product analytics.


What we offer


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can work onsite at our offices in Berlin, Helsinki, Stockholm, or Tallinn. Alternatively, you can work remotely anywhere in Germany, Finland, Sweden, or Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote, within the location above. 💙
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.


Next steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

Requirements

Location: Only for applicants from Germany

Language: German - Fluent, English - Fluent

Your Toolbelt


3+ years of hands-on experience in Data Science
You’re comfortable working with large-scale, messy datasets – even the kind that don’t fit into memory
For you state-of-the-art-methods are not just the methods everybody use. You are not afraid to search for answers in scientific literature.
Strong mathematical intuition – you don’t just apply models; you want to understand why they work
You follow best practices by default, and know when it’s time to question them


Your Tools


Python – comfy with pandas, scikit-learn & friends
Data Science basics – from feature engineering to model validation
SQL – joins, aggregations, subqueries? No problem
Docker & Linux – smooth setup and deployment
AI/ML – real models, not just slide decks
Git – because version control is second nature


Bonus Skills (nice to have):

Apache Spark / Kubernetes / Prefect, Airflow or similar / Torch, VLLM, or LLM-related tooling / pydantic.ai or similar / Shell scripting

Activities

Is your idea of fun wrangling messy data, debugging ML pipelines, and running experiments that actually tell you something? Do you know that correlation ≠ causation, and that pandas aren't just cute animals? 🐼 If your heart beats faster for code, queries, and questions, keep reading. At smartclip, we’re on the hunt for a Data Scientist who’s less into dashboards for the sake of dashboards, and more into uncovering what really matters behind the metrics.


Explore terabytes of real-world data, not toy datasets
Work on questions that don’t have answers on StackOverflow (yet)
Build and improve data products and ML models with a team of domain experts
Have the freedom to use the right tool for the right job, not just the fashionable one


Team

🤝 We believe in flat hierarchies and fast decision-making processes.

Companies like TravelPerk, QA, and Mural use Flank to automate contract negotiation, email triage, and security reviews. What used to take hours of manual work now happens automatically.

We're building in an emerging market that's reshaping how businesses operate. Instead of incremental software improvements, we're designing entirely new ways for AI and humans to collaborate.

If you're excited about defining what's possible when AI becomes a true colleague, you'll find a home here.

We’re seeking an experienced AI Engineer to drive our applied AI initiatives.

We’re a fast-moving start-up where you’ll work closely with product, design, and commercial teams to ship real AI into production — not just research experiments.

You will be tasked with leveraging emerging technologies and a team of legal experts to improve the intelligence and autonomy of our agents.

This might start with building an evals framework in collaboration with our team of lawyers, it might spawn a hypervisor that governs every step of our agentic system and that “knows what good looks like”, and it might end with us building the first alignment program for legal AI systems.

What you’ll be doing:


Drive Applied Research: Drive applied research into LLMs and agentic systems, rapidly prototyping, validating, and shipping production-ready capabilities.
Stay Ahead of the Curve: Stay hands-on with the latest advances in foundation models, LLM-as-a-judge, agentic frameworks & tools (e.g. MCP), and move fast to bring them into the product.


Who you are:


Demonstrated Experience: A strong track record of leading and delivering cutting-edge AI initiatives that have driven meaningful product and business impact. Hands-on experience building and deploying ML/AI products is essential.
Technical Expertise:
Strong programming skills in Python (and familiarity with TypeScript/Go a plus).
Experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face).
Hands-on experience deploying ML/LLM models in production environments.
Solid understanding of data pipelines, APIs, and distributed systems.
Knowledge of prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and embeddings for LLMs.
Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes
Thought Leadership: Ph.D. or Master’s in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related field from a leading academic institution.
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Proven ability to build strong partnerships across product, engineering, and research teams to drive innovation.


What’s In It For You


Innovative Work: Be part of a team making bold bets to create a new paradigm in AI-enhanced legal services.
High Standards Culture: Join a team that demands excellence and accountability through direct and candid communication.
Empowered Environment: Operate in a high-agency culture where you can lead yourself and make a real impact.
Global Team: Remote-first, collaborate with a diverse, talented team across the globe.
Competitive, Benchmarked Salary

Recent hands-on experience in deploying and maintaining an AI agent/workflow powered by LLMs, using both low level SDKs (openai, anthropic, google-genai,..) and prompt engineering frameworks (llama-index, langchain, dspy, ..)
General understanding of LLMOps principles, for evaluating, testing, versioning and experimenting prompts in staging and production (langsmith, langfuse, arize-phoenix, lunary, ..)




WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY NOW




Our culture rewards ownership, excellence, and high energy. We care deeply about outcomes and hold each other accountable - we’re here to win and fix one of the largest challenges Europeans face - closing the pension gap and democratising wealth. If this gets you fired up, reach out!

Job Description

Join us in our Vendor Data team, where you will design, build, and implement advanced monetization and pricing models that shape the economic success of hundreds of thousands of restaurants and local businesses globally.

Your contributions will unlock new revenue streams, optimise vendor monetisation, and guide data-driven decision-making – having a decisive impact on our global bottom-line. Furthermore, you will support our restaurant partners to provide affordable meals to more than 10 million people every day across 60+ countries.

We’re looking for a scientifically rigorous, yet strongly pragmatic and commercially-minded data scientist who thrives on complexity, impact, and autonomy. If you are a go-getter who is excited about high-performance environments and combines intellectual sharpness, strong commercial acumen, and a positive attitude, we would be excited to get to know you.

What you’ll do


Lead the development of econometric and machine learning models to optimise take rate, pricing strategies, and vendor monetisation, working alongside top commercial leaders and technical experts.
Design, run, analyse, and improve experiments and A/B tests to validate your hypotheses in real-world settings.
Present research and recommendations to senior executives, shaping company-wide strategy to enable our 1m+ restaurant partners across the globe to grow while monetizing our services sustainably.
Partner closely with the Commercial, Product, and Data Engineering teams to embed advanced modelling and experimental insights into pricing, incentive, and vendor engagement decisions, while regularly delivering recommendations and insights to senior business leaders.
Join a team with a proven track record in scaling billion-dollar tech business from scratch.

Experience with marketplace pricing dynamics, multi-modal optimisation, and revenue forecasting models, plus deep understanding of economic concepts such as price elasticity, contribution margins, ROI metrics, rebate mechanics, and segmentation analyses
You're a fast learner, critical thinker, and creative problem solver who strives for excellence - and you’re hungry to take on complex, ambiguous challenges
Willingness to take responsibility on high-stakes, company-defining projects with substantial financial impact and eagerness to deliver clear recommendations to top management
Passion for data, with creative problem-solving abilities and an eye for detail
Proficiency in Python and/or R, and SQL (preferably with BigQuery), with experience in statistical modelling and data visualisation (Tableau or similar) with continuous iteration
Excellent English communication skills, both written and oral, and able to explain complex modelling outcomes to both technical and non-technical audiences in a concise way

Our growing team of 1,800+ Personios across Europe and the US are building user-friendly products that delight our 14,000+ customers and their 1.5 million employees. Ready to make an impact from day one?

ML Engineer - with Data Science Background (d/f/m)

Personio is growing rapidly. With that growth comes the increasing demand for machine learning solutions that don’t just provide insights, but power real, production-ready products.

As an ML Engineer, you will play a pivotal role in shaping Personio’s AI and ML capabilities. We are looking for someone who can build high-quality ML systems with the rigor of an engineer, while also bringing the curiosity and experimentation mindset of a data scientist. Your work will involve productionizing ML and generative AI models, ensuring they deliver measurable business impact.

You’ll join our central AI/ML function, collaborating across departments to drive innovation and enable AI-driven decision-making at scale.

What You’ll Do


Design, develop, and deploy robust machine learning and AI systems for a range of business use cases, including generative AI.
Build and operationalize ML solutions to address business challenges and unlock new opportunities.
Integrate ML and AI models into production systems, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
Deploy and monitor MLOps workflows, including CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, monitoring, and model versioning.
Leverage cloud platforms (AWS + Snowflake) and ML infrastructure (e.g., SageMaker, feature stores) for scalable deployment.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Product, Sales, Marketing, etc.) to deliver AI-driven features and insights.
Ensure all ML/AI solutions adhere to best practices in data privacy, security, and ethical standards.
Contribute to a culture of technical excellence, knowledge sharing, and continuous learning.


What You Need To Succeed


University degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
5+ years’ experience building and deploying production-grade machine learning models.
Strong software engineering mindset — ability to write clean, reusable, and scalable code in Python.
Experience integrating ML/AI models into production software systems.
Solid understanding of MLOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and automated testing frameworks.
Background in data science: comfort with experimentation, A/B testing, and measuring ROI/impact of ML projects (not just accuracy).
Hands-on experience with ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face).
Experience with NLP or generative AI techniques is a strong plus. Familiarity with cloud-based ML infrastructure (AWS, Snowflake, SageMaker, etc.).


Why this role?


Join a newly created AI sprint team focused exclusively on delivering LLM and ML-powered projects with real business impact.
Work in a lean, well-supported environment (dedicated TPM, analytics engineer, and data platform support — no need to build ingestion pipelines).
Full ownership of end-to-end ML delivery: from prototype to production.
Exposure to high-impact use cases (e.g., automating marketing campaigns, personalization engines) backed by executive sponsorship.
A chance to bridge the gap between data science and engineering, bringing cutting-edge AI into production at scale.


Why Personio?

We’re one of Europe’s fastest-growing tech companies, building the leading HR platform for SMEs. With over 15,000 customers, offices across Europe, and strong backing from top-tier investors, Personio is scaling fast — and AI is a critical enabler of that growth.

We’re also proud of our culture:


A diverse, inclusive workplace where your voice matters.
Competitive compensation, equity, and benefits. 28 days’ vacation, plus an additional day after two and four years.
Flexible, office-led but remote-friendly working with the option for international work weeks.
Mental health support, family leave, Impact Days, sabbaticals, and regular team events.

Join us in our Vendor Data team, where you will design, build, and implement advanced monetization and pricing models that shape the economic success of hundreds of thousands of restaurants and local businesses globally.

Your contributions will unlock new revenue streams, optimise vendor monetisation, and guide data-driven decision-making – having a decisive impact on our global bottom-line. Furthermore, you will support our restaurant partners to provide affordable meals to more than 10 million people every day across 60+ countries.

Experience with marketplace pricing dynamics, multi-modal optimisation, and revenue forecasting models, plus deep understanding of economic concepts such as price elasticity, contribution margins, ROI metrics, rebate mechanics, and segmentation analyses
You're a fast learner, critical thinker, and creative problem solver who strives for excellence - and you’re hungry to take on complex, ambiguous challenges
Willingness to take responsibility on high-stakes, company-defining projects with substantial financial impact and eagerness to deliver clear recommendations to top management
Passion for data, with creative problem-solving abilities and an eye for detail
Proficiency in Python and/or R, and SQL (preferably with BigQuery), with experience in statistical modelling and data visualisation (Tableau or similar) with continuous iteration
Excellent English communication skills, both written and oral, and able to explain complex modelling outcomes to both technical and non-technical audiences in a concise way

We're looking for someone who gets genuinely excited about a new LLM release, can build a working demo before lunch, and explain why it matters—clearly and confidently. You're not here to chase hype — you want to explore what's possible and help teams and clients build what's useful. This role blends research, rapid prototyping, client enablement, and internal education. You'll dive into new tools, test ideas fast, shape solution concepts, and help people across the company make smarter, more confident GenAI decisions.

Do you thrive on solving hard problems (individually and collectively), yet humble and hungry to learn and grow within a team on your path to greatness?




Do you desire to become a part of a close-knit pack led by SV startup veterans who can accelerate your growth 10X (compared to the corporate trajectory/culture)?




If you’ve answered with 3 resounding ""yes"", then we want to meet you!




We are seeking a passionate and proactive AI/GenAI Engineer with at least 2 years of professional experience to join us at a pivotal moment. We are also open to talented individuals who are driven, curious, and of high character, and can showcase prolific contributions to open-source or personal projects.




The ideal candidate is a self-starter who loves solving hard problems and can work backwards from the goal and thrive in dynamic team environments and is eager to make a significant impact. Experience with Computer Vision, LLMs, Voice, RAG, and Classification is highly valued.


Tasks



Navigate ambiguity and adapt quickly in a fast-moving team


Demonstrate ownership: proactively identify challenges and raise your hand to drive solutions


Work hard and maintain a strong work ethic in a dynamic environment. Embraces in-person collaborations (whiteboard sessions, anti-fragile discussions to reach team clarity)


Collaborate across distributed teams to design, build, and iterate on innovative AI solutions from concept to production


Champion a culture of curiosity, resilience, and continuous learning


Communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively, both in writing and verbally, with an emphasis on over communication


Participate in code reviews, architecture discussions, and knowledge sharing


Show enthusiasm for the advancement of agentic and decentralized AI systems



Requirements



Minimum 2 years of professional-level experience with Python and TypeScript (required)


Familiarity with LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, Google ADK (preferred)


Experience with containerization and Docker (preferred)


Familiarity with chain-of-thought prompting, in-context learning, or multi-agent pipelines


Knowledge of vector databases such as Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS (preferred)


Experience with React (nice to have)


Familiarity with MCP and A2A (nice to have)


Experience fine-tuning Computer Vision models (nice to have)



Benefits



Competitive Compensation & Meaningful Equity: We value talent and back it with fair, founder-level alignment. You’ll own a real stake in the company’s future.


High-Impact, High-Ownership Role: You won’t be a cog in the machine. You’ll own initiatives end-to-end and help shape the core of our AI stack and company direction.


Work Directly with the CEO & Founding Team: Collaborate daily with the CEO and technical leadership to drive product, strategy, and long-term vision.


Build What Doesn’t Exist (Yet): We’re working on first-principle AI infrastructure that doesn’t exist elsewhere. If you’re here to do original, meaningful work — this is it.


Zero Bureaucracy, Maximum Autonomy: We move fast, stay lean, and keep decision-making close to the builders. Your input drives the roadmap.


Flexible, But In-Person Matters: We’re remote-first, but we believe in the power of face-to-face time. We hold monthly gatherings/hackathons in SF and Europe, to stay aligned and build real momentum together. Results still matter more than hours — but we show up when it counts.





Our Hiring Process




We move fast, stay transparent, and focus on real collaboration. Here’s what the process looks like:





Intro Call – A quick chat to align on expectations, interests, and team fit.


Technical Deep Dive – A focused conversation with our Engineering Manager to explore your technical thinking and past work.


CEO Interview – A strategic discussion around vision, mindset, and long-term alignment.


Reference Collection – We’ll speak with a few people you’ve worked closely with.


Paid Trial (~5 Days) – A short, real-world engagement so we can see how we work together — happening in parallel with offer and terms discussion.





Please note:





As a startup, you can expect a fast-paced environment where extreme ownership is required.


If you are seeking a traditional corporate 9-to-5 role, this may not be the right fit.

Get connected: Take the opportunity to engage in our Digital Empowerment Communities for collaboration, learning, and network building.
Recharge your battery: You have 30 days of paid vacation per year plus Christmas and New Year's Eve off. Your battery still needs charging? You can exchange parts of your salary for more paid vacation or you can take a sabbatical.
Elevate your mobility: From car and bike leasing offers to a subsidised Deutschland-Ticket – your way is our way.
Think ahead: With our company pension scheme and a great insurance package we take care of your future.
This is by far not all… We are looking forward to speaking with you about further benefits during the hiring process.

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we’re building the delivery of (almost) everything and you’ll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely exciting. Here you’ll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You’ll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you’re a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

Now is your chance to join an international team of experts driving growth and quality at Wolt! The Global Delivery Operations Supply team is building the future of courier operations at Wolt.

In this role you are responsible for supporting our Operations teams in meeting the set KPIs on customer and courier experience through developing our planning process, developing our OKRs and target setting process, and offering project based support on supply topics on need basis.

This is not an easy role, and requires a versatile skill set to succeed. This role includes frequent collaboration and alignment with Global Operations, Region operations, Acquisition teams, Courier Marketing, Procurement, Product, and Analytics on top of great analytical skills.

Monitor & course-correct: Supporting Global and Region operations on needed ad-hoc strategy & operations projects. For example targeted acquisition efforts to support growth in a given market or driving investment asks for additional activation budget to improve quality on peak hours.


You will report to our Global Head of Courier Supply.

Our humble expectations

We are looking for someone with:


Experience working in operations or strategic business development in a fast-paced environment

Attitude for action and ownership beyond the obvious. You are constantly looking for opportunities to improve and have the determination to drive change
Master degree in a relevant field (Industrial Engineering, Business, or related)
The ability to work in cross-functional teams, maintain and manage relationships with multiple stakeholders

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities.

We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)

Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

It’s too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive.

That’s why, since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

What you’ll do

Explore & analyse large telematics, policy and quote datasets to uncover trends and opportunities
Build and validate statistical & machine learning models that power pricing and risk selection
Collaborate with Engineering, Actuarial and Product to frame business problems and productionise models
Communicate insights clearly through dashboards, visualisations and storytelling
Contribute to best practice in code review, experimentation and shaping our ways of working as you grow




What you’ll bring

Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Data Science or related field
Experience: At least 3 years of proven experience as a Data Scientist
Python Proficiency: Strong Python programming skills, with experience in training predictive models. Familiarity with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn

Software Engineering:
Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) and software development best practices in a data-intensive environment
Care about documentation and reproducibility
Curiosity and a problem-solving mindset
Excellent communication skills, with a proven ability to present complex information in a clear, accessible way




Nice to have (but not essential)

Experience with CI/CD pipelines (we use buildkite and argoCD)
Hands-on experience with insurance pricing tools like Akur8, Emblem or similar pricing modelling tools
Exposure to telematics or usage-based insurance data
Experience with time series analysis and/or graph technologies




What’s it like to work at Zego?

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things.

We’re spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We’re proud of our company and our culture – a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

Together, we’re setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There’s loads of room to learn and grow, and you’ll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you want.

How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid.

Our hybrid way of working is unique. We don't mandate fixed office days. Instead, we foster a flexible approach that empowers every Zegon to perform at their best. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. You have the flexibility to choose the day that works best for you and your team. We cover the costs for all company-wide events (3 per year), and also provide a separate hybrid contribution to help pay towards other travel costs. We think it’s a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.




Our approach to AI

We believe in the power of AI to meaningfully improve how we work - helping us move faster, think differently, and focus on what matters most. At Zego, we encourage people to stay curious and intentional about how AI is leveraged in their work and teams to drive practical impact every day. This is your chance to do the most meaningful work of your career - and we’ll provide you with the tools, support, and freedom to do it well.




Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you’ll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. We also offer an annual flexible hybrid working contribution, which you can use to support with your travel to the office or towards your own personal development. And that’s just for starters.




We’re an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

Can the Delivery food market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?


The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Masters Degree or PhD in Economics or Econometrics (preferred)
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail

This is a greenfield role in the media tech industry. You’ll be involved from the very beginning, helping shape and build rather than just maintaining existing systems. The work itself is hands-on and impactful: a lot of automation, data extraction and transformation, and feeding into LLMs.




What helps for this role:

Around 2 years’ experience in data science or data engineering (or a relevant degree plus some hands-on data work) - we are happy to consider less experience if there is relevant other internships/work experience
A background in computer science, maths, physics, or data-related fields.
Curiosity, problem-solving skills, and a real interest in applying data to practical challenges.




📍 London-based, 2 days a week in the office




It’s a role with plenty of space to learn and contribute... ideal for someone early in their career who’s ready to develop their skills and work with modern tools in a supportive team.

3+ years in product development, ideally in chocolate, confectionery, plant-based or sensory-led categories
Strong understanding of ingredient functionality, sensory science and flavour chemistry
Experience with data science and statistical analysis for sensory and product testing
HACCP Level 3 or higher, with practical experience applying food safety systems
A practical, collaborative approach and an interest in sustainable food innovation




If you don’t meet every single point but have relevant skills and motivation, we’d still like to hear from you.




How we work




This role is based in our London lab and office with at least 4 days per week on site. Occasional travel may be required.




Salary and benefits




£39,000–£45,000 per year, depending on experience, plus performance-based incentives
Professional development and opportunities to grow with a rapidly scaling company
A collaborative, inclusive workplace that values different perspectives and creativity
A vibrant office in the centre of East London with a barista-level coffee machine and great snacks
The chance to contribute to a more sustainable and ethical food system




Right to work




Applicants must already have the right to work in the UK. Unfortunately, we cannot offer visa sponsorship for this role, and applications from candidates who require sponsorship cannot be considered.

We’re on a mission to help the hospitality industry double their profitability, reduce their carbon footprint, and create better working environments for their teams.

Our CEO, Conor, founded and scaled Mad Egg - one of the fastest-growing restaurant groups in Ireland. After years of juggling “market-leading” systems, spreadsheets, and paper printouts, he set out to build the solution he wished he had from day one: Nory.

Nory is an all-knowing restaurant management system. It combines real-time data with AI predictive analytics to help restaurants operate with consistency, certainty and profitability. From food prep to forecasting, Nory puts operators in control of their margins.

Now, with demand growing faster than we imagined - and a recent Series A led by Accel - we’re scaling fast. We’ve grown to a team of 50+ across Ireland, the UK and Spain, and we’re just getting started.

We’re now looking for a Senior Applied ML Scientist to join our Data team. This role is ideal for a senior independent doer, someone who has owned the entire ML lifecycle and is ready to ship meaningful, production-grade ML systems from scratch. This is not a research or experimentation role; it's about building systems that work in the real world and move the needle on customer outcomes and business impact. It is about building production ML algorithms that move KPIs.

🌏 Please note you must have the right to work in the UK/EU to be considered for this role.

What you’ll be doing


Own the end-to-end development of machine learning systems, from business problem formulation and algorithm design through to deployment and monitoring in production
Collaborate with product managers and engineers to define KPIs, design data flows, and embed algorithms in product features
Apply best-in-class ML practices with clear problem framing, model evaluation, experimentation, and observability- to deliver real-world impact
Independently lead the development of models across the platform, acting as the primary ML owner; from data access and cleaning to modelling and integration
Work autonomously while contributing to a culture of collaboration, shared learning, and continuous improvement
Actively participate in peer reviews, team rituals, and cross-functional discovery, sharing insight and offering help where needed


What you’ll bring


Background: Master's Degree in a STEM subject, with a significant statistics component
Full Lifecycle Ownership: 4+ years of experience taking ML systems from idea through to production in a commercial setting - repeatedly and successfully. You’re confident in owning the process independently, from problem formulation to monitoring impact in production
Classical ML theory depth: You are familiar with time-series forecasting, regression/classification, causal signals, feature engineering, evaluation/monitoring, and drift
Technical Proficiency: Strong Python and experience with ML libraries (e.g., Scikitlearn, Pandas, LightGBM), plus working knowledge of cloud infrastructure and data tools (Snowflake, DBT, Omni)
Rigour & Impact: You apply rigorous statistical and experimental thinking, and can demonstrate how your work has driven measurable business outcomes
Collaboration: You thrive in highly collaborative environments, communicate clearly, and offer help where needed to improve team outcomes
Startup mindset: You thrive in fast-paced environments, move quickly, and take initiative to maintain momentum and resolve issues efficiently. You are comfortable with ambiguity and multitask effectively while delivering real impact


Nice-to-have:


You have worked in smaller data teams with a high ownership culture
You have worked on B2B SaaS products
Experience with LLMs is a plus, but this role is not for LLM specialists - we solve forecasting, optimisation, and statistical learning problems


What you’ll get in return:

💰 Competitive salary depending on experience

📈 Equity at our Series A valuation

🌴 35 days of paid leave per year (including bank holidays)

🏥 Comprehensive private health insurance

🍼 Enhanced parental leave and baby loss support

📚 Learning & development culture – €1000 personal annual budget + quarterly book budget

🖥️ €250 home office workspace budget

🎯 Regular team offsites & socials

📍Remote working with co-working office space in either London 🇬🇧 (LABS House, 15-19 Bloomsbury Way) or Dublin 🇮🇪 (Dogpatch Labs)

👏 And much more

How we work

Our vision is to build a better future for the restaurant industry.

One where operators are in control, margins are stronger, and frontline teams can build careers they’re proud of. To get there, we move fast, stay focused, and hold ourselves to a high bar. Our values guide how we work, grow, and win – together.

These are the values we live by:


We serve up impact with a side of profit


We prioritise work that delivers real financial results for our restaurant partners.


We prioritise speed of service


We move fast, unblock quickly, and deliver with urgency.


We act like owners


We own problems, raise the bar, and build better every day.


We win as a crew


We grow stronger through feedback, collaboration, and shared wins.

Interview Process


15-minute Initial Chat with Talent and People Partner
40-minute Hiring Manager Interview with our Head of Data
90-minute live problem solving session with our senior data team member (no prep required)
40-minute Culture Interview with a Head of Design or Product
30-minute Final Stage with our CEO


We hire humans.

At Nory, we believe that diverse teams build better products. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds, identities, and walks of life. Your individuality matters, and we’re committed to creating an inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive. We do not discriminate based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, family status, age, disability, or race.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We are a Toronto-based technology company transforming inspection workflows in high-stakes environments, starting with airfields. Our flagship platform, InspectEx, integrates data from multiple sensors (visible, thermal, LiDAR, GPS, IMU) to detect issues such as foreign object debris, pavement surface conditions, lighting faults, and non-compliant snowbanks in real time. We automatically log inspection data, deliver actionable alerts, and provide insights that help organizations operate more safely, efficiently, and intelligently.




Who We're Looking For

We’re looking for a pragmatic, resourceful ML Engineer to join our startup team. This role isn’t about chasing perfect models, it’s about shipping effective solutions that solve real industrial problems and make airfields safer, smarter, and more efficient.




We want people who are fast learners, independent thinkers, and natural problem-solvers. If you thrive in ambiguity, can ship production ML under real-world constraints, and believe communication is as important as code then you’ll fit right in.




What You'll Do

Design, build, and deploy ML models, with emphasis on computer vision.
Drive the ML lifecycle (data collection/creation, preprocessing, storage, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring) in collaboration with our VP Engineering and Technical Artists.
Optimize models for edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) and cloud platforms.
Translate messy operational challenges into clear, technical solutions.
Ship fast: deliver a simple, working solution in weeks, then improve it.
Share openly. We succeed as a team, not as siloed researchers.




What You Bring

3+ years of professional, hands-on ML and software development experience. Academic projects are fine, but we hire people who have shipped and maintained live systems.
Proven production deployment. You’ve dealt with performance, scaling, and things breaking in the field, not just benchmarks in a lab.
Strong communicator. Clear communication is a core technical skill. You can explain trade-offs, set expectations, and build trust across teams.
Problem-solver’s mindset. You’re curious, adaptable, and driven to find the fastest path to real value.
Technical foundation. Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, solid ML theory, software engineering fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, testing).
Degree in CS, Engineering, or related field.




Bonus Points For:

Exposure to AI for autonomous driving and sensor fusion is a big plus. For example, BEVFusion or V2XFusion models, or Kalman filtering for location estimation.
MLOps tools + cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).
C++ for ML/CV libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV).
Point-cloud (e.g. LiDAR) or database (e.g. SQL) experience.




Compensation & Benefits

Salary: $115,000–$145,000 CAD, based on experience.
Equity: Meaningful participation in our plan.
Vacation: 3 weeks to start, 4 in year 2, 5 in year 3.
Purpose Leave: 30 days off every two years at 75% pay.
Flexibility: Remote-first, flexible hours.




Our Interview Process

We value your time and aim for a transparent and efficient process:




Phone screen (30 min): Background + project discussion.
Technical interview (Karat): 1-on-1 tailored interview focused on problem-solving & coding.
Leadership interview (90 min): Project presentation & discussion + team fit.




Illuminex AI is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive, supportive, and kind environment for all employees.

Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU deep learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, NVIDIA’s GPU runs deep learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why NVIDIA GPUs are used broadly for deep learning, and NVIDIA is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.”

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


PhD + 3 years, MS/MA + 6 years or BS/BA 8 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

TERM: 6 MONTH CONTRACT

Company Overview

Ready to shape the future of AI-driven advertising and build products that transform how brands connect with audiences? We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our team at Salt Media and be a part of the evolution.

Every day at Salt Media, we’re facilitating more informed, valuable conversations between companies and the people they serve. We’re driven by our mission to “Bring Audiences Home”—helping brands cut through irrelevant noise and connect with people who truly care.

As an AI-driven media agency powered by our own proprietary products, we help clients make smarter, more impactful ad buying decisions while delivering a better experience for brands and consumers alike. Our product suite and unique in-house service models blend the best of data science and marketing, empowering clients to take ownership of their digital media, social buying, and first-party data strategies.

Media Mob, our creator discovery platform


…and this is just the beginning. We're constantly ideating and building. As one of our Data Scientists, you'll play a pivotal role not only in shaping and refining these products but also in envisioning and creating the next wave of transformative products that will define our future.

About You

If you’re an engineer who loves building product, has an ownership mentality and is someone who constantly wants to learn and evolve, here are a few reasons why you might be excited to join Salt Media:


Work with Cutting-Edge AI
AI isn’t just a buzzword for us — it’s in our DNA. As a Data Scientist, you’ll engage directly with generative models, ML-driven decision-making tools, and advanced data pipelines. You’ll use licensed AI tools internally to enhance your daily workflows and collaborate with colleagues, and will be given regular opportunities to explore and learn new tooling to help us all stay ahead of the curve and work smarter.

Instead, you’ll tackle a variety of challenges, on a variety of products, from improving backend architectures and optimizing models to experimenting with new tools and frameworks. Your work will make an immediate, visible difference to clients and the company’s trajectory.
Autonomy and Ownership
Rather than waiting for permission, you’ll propose solutions, influence product direction, and shape development processes. Our flat org structure eliminates red tape and encourages direct communication. If you see an opportunity to build something better, you run with it.
Exposure to the Entire Business
At Salt Media, you won’t be isolated in your own technical corner. You’ll collaborate closely with product leaders, data scientists, client-facing teams, and even the CEO. This cross-functional exposure expands your understanding of the product and customers, helping you hone both technical and business skills.
Fast-Paced Growth and Learning
Ad tech is evolving quickly, and we move with it. That means constant learning, continuous improvement, and never feeling stuck in outdated tech stacks or stale processes. As the company grows, so do your opportunities—new responsibilities, new projects, and a larger platform to showcase your talents.
A Culture of Curiosity and Transparency
Expect open communication, direct feedback, and a culture that values curiosity and problem solving over rigid hierarchies. You’ll join a team that encourages questions, celebrates breakthroughs, and is genuinely excited about building product to shake up a traditional industry.

DataRobot delivers AI that maximizes impact and minimizes business risk. Our platform and applications integrate into core business processes so teams can develop, deliver, and govern AI at scale. DataRobot empowers practitioners to deliver predictive and generative AI, and enables leaders to secure their AI assets. Organizations worldwide rely on DataRobot for AI that makes sense for their business — today and in the future.

Job Description

The Data Scientist role in the Customer Engineering team plays a pivotal role at the intersection of AI/ML engineering, solution development, and go-to-market strategy. We are looking for an experienced data scientist who excels in hands-on problem-solving, can lead technical initiatives, and can serve as a trusted advisor to both internal teams and customers.

Your work will focus on designing, developing, and delivering production-ready AI solutions that accelerate customer adoption of the DataRobot platform, with a particular focus on SAP workflows.

Beyond solution development, you will work directly with clients in various industries as the DataRobot product and data science subject matter expert.

This role is ideal for a motivated data scientist with proven experience who wants to work hands-on with Python, pandas, and modern AI tooling while making a significant impact on customer success and AI adoption. If you thrive in a fast-paced, highly autonomous environment and want to build AI solutions that truly scale, we'd love to hear from you!

Key Responsibilities:



Design and develop sophisticated, production-ready assets that accelerate AI/ML adoption for customers, ranging from reusable solution templates to deployable frameworks.
Lead the implementation of AI/ML workflows using Python, pandas, and modern AI tooling, ensuring they are scalable, maintainable, and customer-ready.
Establish and champion engineering best practices to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability of AI/ML solutions.
Work within existing infrastructure to support scalable AI deployments, including CI/CD automation, API integrations, and containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes).
Create comprehensive testing strategies and implement automated tests for AI/ML workflows.
Lead cross-functional collaboration with product, sales, and marketing teams to scale high-impact solutions.
Address complex real-world deployment challenges, including monitoring, logging, and improving reliability in AI/ML workflows.
Serve as a technical liaison in customer engagements, representing the DataRobot product to various personas from data scientists to C-level executives.
Lead proof of value processes and quantify the business impact of DataRobot solutions.
Ensure the success of our customers by collaborating with business stakeholders to ensure that AI solutions deliver successful business outcomes
Stay ahead of industry trends, continuously refining our approaches and advocating for best practices in AI/ML engineering.
Work closely with enablement teams to develop documentation, content, and training materials that scale adoption of our solutions.



What this Role is Not:



A SWAT demo team - while you will be customer-facing, this role is about building reusable solutions, not one-off demos.
A technical marketing role - you'll collaborate with marketing but won't be driving content strategy.
A pure research role - we need hands-on builders who can ship working solutions that make an impact.



Knowledge, Skills and Abilities:



Strong Python ecosystem expertise with the ability to design, develop, and troubleshoot complex ML workflows using libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and web server tools like FastAPI.
3-5 years of experience in data science, machine learning, or AI development with a proven track record of delivering production solutions.
Experience with ML model development, deployment, and evaluation. You should be comfortable leading data-to-insights projects and optimizing predictive models.
Strong data engineering capabilities, including working with structured/unstructured data, feature engineering, and optimizing ML pipelines.
Proficiency in writing efficient, maintainable, and well-structured code, with an emphasis on reusability, scalability, and production readiness.
Experience with software engineering best practices, including containerization (Docker), CI/CD automation, and cloud-based ML deployment.
Experience with APIs, SDK development, or ML platform integrations.
Proven experience in consultative sales processes in the data/analytics marketplace, with the ability to translate complex technical concepts into business value.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to influence stakeholders at various technical and business levels.
Self-motivated, driven, and eager to take on challenges. We're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-moving, high-growth, and high-autonomy environment.



Nice to Have:



Experience with SAP workflows and integration points
Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) for AI/ML deployment
Strong knowledge of automated testing and test-driven development
Familiarity with generative AI solutions like RAG, finetuning, etc.
Experience with DataRobot platform or similar enterprise AI platforms
Masters' degree in Data Science, Computer Science, or related field
Experience presenting at conferences or creating technical content



Why Join Us?



Hands-on, high-impact work - you'll be building real, production-ready AI solutions that customers actually use.
Small, elite team with direct influence - you'll work closely with product, engineering, and go-to-market teams to shape AI adoption strategies.
Fast learning environment - we invest in our people, providing opportunities to grow and expand your skills.
Clear career trajectory - whether you want to specialize in data science, transition into engineering, or take on leadership, we'll help you get there.
Work on cutting-edge AI solutions that have real-world impact and are used by enterprises worldwide.



This is a unique opportunity to build AI applications, ensuring that data scientists and developers can seamlessly create, customize, and deploy AI solutions at scale. If you're passionate about impacting the future of AI adoption, we'd love to hear from you.

This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Your models don’t just sit on a shelf—they shape strategy, optimize efficiency, and fuel company growth. You thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, validating hypotheses, and embedding machine learning models into real-world AI applications. If that sounds like you, read on.

AlgaeCal is on the hunt for a Data Scientist to develop mathematical algorithms and apply machine learning to analyze business data, test hypotheses, and turn raw information into strategies that drive measurable results.




This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we’re driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.




The good news? AlgaeCal has the world’s only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you’ll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal.




This job might be for you if you’ve got…

2+ years experience as a Data Scientist (or a similar role) and can back it up with a resume that shows real results. You’ve built predictive models, optimized AI applications, and refined data architectures that have had a measurable impact. You don’t just analyze numbers, you translate data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.
Serious coding skills in Python or R. You know how to build and refine machine learning models that actually work. You’ve used statistical modeling and data science tools to solve complex problems and unlock growth opportunities.
Expertise in SQL and relational databases. Writing efficient queries? Optimizing data structures? Your resume is packed with quantifiable examples that’ll make us drool with desire! You know how to work with large datasets, ensuring data is organized, accessible, and primed for analysis.
Kaggle-level knowledge of artificial intelligence models. And if you think RAG is something you clean your countertops with, this probably isn’t the role for you.
A deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Whether it’s regression, clustering, or neural networks, you know how to choose the right approach for the right challenge. You don’t just apply models, you understand how they work under the hood.
Hands-on experience with data warehouses. BigQuery or similar? Check. You understand how to design, maintain, and optimize scalable data storage solutions that support robust analytics.
A knack for standardizing and improving data models. You’ve worked with data at scale, refining schemas and improving architectures to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and usability across the organization.
A laser-sharp eye for detail. You’re the kind of person who spots trends, outliers, and opportunities that others miss. Your ability to catch anomalies helps ensure our models and analytics are always on point.
An entrepreneurial approach to data. You don’t just crunch numbers, you think strategically about how data can be leveraged to create business value. You’re proactive in identifying new ways AI and machine learning can drive efficiency, sales, and profitability.
Industry know-how that adds value. If you’ve got experience in consumer packaged goods, e-commerce, or the health/supplement industry, that’s a huge plus. You understand how data can shape customer experience, optimize operations, and maximize ROI.

Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you’re nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can’t wait to meet you.




Other Qualities You’ll Need

At AlgaeCal we’re going to insist that you have these 3 qualities:

You’re humble—you put the team and others’ needs ahead of your own
You’re hungry to learn more
You’re people smart––in the sense that you’re a great teammate

The truth is, if you don’t have these qualities you won’t last long at AlgaeCal. So if you’re missing one of them, be honest. Save yourself a lot of headaches and skip to a job posting that is a better fit for you.

What Will You Earn?

Our Data Scientist position starts at $75,000 and can go up to $90,000 depending on your experience. If your salary expectations differ from this range, let us know! We are open to discussing compensation that matches your unique skill set.




You’ll also enjoy the following benefits:

Monthly team events and activities
Flexible Stat Holidays with the option to bank days for later use
Weekly team lunches
Casual dress code
Incredible dog friendly, Yaletown office one block from SkyTrain
Remote working is okay with us too.

And above all, you’ll join a team that you’ll never want to leave. Culture is everything to us. Yes, we work extremely hard to change as many people’s lives as possible. But we know how to have fun and reward ourselves too.




How To Apply

So, do you have what it takes to become the next member of team AlgaeCal?

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Meroka is building the future of independent medicine in the United States. We provide operations, finance, tech, and strategic support to physician-owned practices-helping them grow sustainably and with soul. This is in addition to support for physicians transitioning ownership to the employees of the business.

We believe in clear communication, practical systems, thoughtful design, and long-term thinking. Our tone is warm, grounded, and confident-but never corporate or clinical.

❌ This Role Is Not for You If…


You only want to train models rather than build end to end AI powered workflows
You are uncomfortable integrating third party systems like EHR, billing, accounting, and HR software
You prefer to work in research mode rather than shipping production ready features
You want rigid specifications instead of working iteratively with product and operations teams
You avoid regulated industries where compliance and auditability are critical


✅ What You’ll Do


Agentic Workflow Design: Build and deploy AI powered agents that connect across billing, finance, HR, payroll, and other practice systems to give users a single operational login
System Integration: Work with APIs and data pipelines to connect EHR, billing, and accounting software seamlessly into the Meroka platform
Applied AI Automation: Translate repetitive operational tasks into AI driven workflows that save time for practice staff and physicians
User Facing Product Development: Collaborate with designers and product managers to ensure AI powered features are intuitive, reliable, and trusted by users
Compliance and Security: Design systems with HIPAA, SOC 2, and healthcare regulatory requirements built in from the start
Cross Functional Collaboration: Partner with operations, finance, and enablement teams to identify high impact workflows to automate and improve


🧠 We’re Looking For Someone Who…


Has 3 or more years of experience in software engineering with exposure to AI or agentic frameworks
Is fluent in building integrations with third party APIs and cloud based SaaS platforms
Brings strong programming skills in Python, TypeScript, or similar languages
Has experience working with LLMs and AI orchestration frameworks (LangChain, OpenAI tools, etc)
Understands how to build user facing applications with reliability, transparency, and auditability
Can work closely with product and design to deliver features that feel seamless to non technical users
Thrives in early stage environments where speed, ownership, and clarity are essential


💰 What We Offer


Competitive compensation and health benefits
Unlimited vacation and flexible working arrangements
The opportunity to shape the first AI powered workflows that unify all practice operations in one platform
Ownership of core features that directly impact how independent physician practices run every day
A thoughtful, ambitious team that values pragmatism, clarity, and long term thinking


🌍 Additional Notes


This role will require occasional travel to the USA and Canada for on-site campaigns, team collaboration, and brand activations. All travel will be coordinated and supported by the Meroka team.


📣 How To Apply


Send us your CV and examples of integrations, workflows, or AI powered features you have built. Bonus points if you include a Loom video walking us through a project where you automated a complex workflow or unified multiple systems into one user experience.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Are you passionate about building AI/ML/LLM-powered systems that help safeguard the authenticity & the integrity of a platform used by millions? Are you passionate about protecting users from fake reviews and deceptive behaviors?

Yelp’s Trust & Safety is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer with an infrastructure focus for the Spam team, the team behind Yelp’s review recommendation software. You’ll be shaping our ML infrastructure and, over time, contribute to core machine learning model development and experimentation.

Due to our work’s sensitivity, our team operates under strict internal non-disclosure agreements (NDA), collaborating only with select NDA partners. This role is focused on building and adapting ML infrastructure specifically for the Spam team, ensuring both privacy and compliance.

This opportunity is fully remote and does not require you to be located in any particular area in Canada. We welcome applicants from throughout Canada. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

What You'll Do


Design and build secure, compliant ML infrastructure and automation, adapting Yelp’s Core ML stack for our NDA protected environment.
Develop and maintain ML and data pipelines (training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring) serving models that fight fraud and spam.
Implement access controls and data handling protocols to safeguard sensitive data at all stages of the ML lifecycle.
Collaborate closely within the Spam team and with NDA partner teams in Core ML and Security, aligning with best MLOps and privacy practices.
Contribute to model development, prototyping, and experimentation as the role evolves and the team’s needs expand.


What It Takes To Succeed


A solid foundation in software engineering fundamentals and best practices.
Experience with modern ML/Data Engineering tools: Python, Spark, AWS (S3, Redshift), and databases technologies (SQL/NoSQL), as well as Kubernetes.
Proven background building or adapting ML infrastructure or MLOps tooling for internal teams.
Deep understanding of privacy, data protection, secure engineering, and access control.
Familiarity with ML operations (MLflow, Kubeflow, Airflow, versioning, experiment tracking, model serving, CI/CD for ML).
Excellent communication skills, comfortable operating under NDA, and able to work proactively and discreetly on sensitive projects.


What You'll Get


Compensation range is $101,000-196,000 annually. Depending on your role and level, you may also be offered a bonus, restricted stock units, and benefits.
This opportunity has the option to be fully remote in all locations across Canada.

Rapidly design and iterate on prototypes using LLMs, embeddings, RAG pipelines, and agent-based frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, etc.).
Translate complex business challenges into AI-enabled workflows and decision-support tools.
Build modular, reusable components (prompts, agents, connectors, evaluation harnesses) that other teams can adopt.


Agentic AI Enablement


Develop and operationalize AI agents for workflow automation, decision-making, and orchestration across business systems.
Implement guardrails, monitoring, and feedback loops to ensure reliable, safe, and compliant agent behavior.
Design human-in-the-loop mechanisms to balance autonomy with accountability.


Collaboration & Enablement


Partner with business SMEs, data engineers, and governance leads to co-develop solutions that are impactful and compliant.
Run workshops, training sessions, and co-creation labs to build AI literacy and enable teams to experiment responsibly.
Act as a trusted advisor to business leaders, showcasing how AI can improve investment, operational, and client outcomes.


Deployment & Lifecycle Management


Work with platform teams to deploy models securely on Azure, AWS, or OpenAI APIs, integrating with existing enterprise systems.
Establish CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, rollback, and documentation for production AI.
Continuously evaluate and recommend emerging tools, frameworks, and platforms that advance CC&LFG’s AI maturity.


What You Bring


Proven hands-on experience with large language models (LLMs), embeddings, RAG pipelines, and generative AI workflows.
Strong background in agentic AI frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, Hugging Face, or similar).
Expertise with cloud AI platforms (Azure OpenAI, Azure ML, AWS Bedrock, OpenAI API Platform).
Understanding of AI evaluation metrics, interpretability, ethical AI, and compliance.
Ability to translate business needs into AI workflows and communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
A growth and enablement mindset: passionate about teaching, upskilling teams, and building a culture of responsible AI adoption.


Why join us?

At CC&LFG, you’ll be part of a team that doesn’t just deliver AI solutions — we enable the business to adopt and scale AI responsibly. You’ll pioneer the use of agentic AI in financial services, creating frameworks that help teams innovate while staying aligned with compliance and governance.

The starting salary for this position is $150,000. The salary range provided reflects the base salary range for this position as required by legislation. In addition, there is an annual performance bonus which contributes to the total compensation of this position. Further questions may be directed to the HR team during the interview process.

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.




We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.




Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.




Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.




Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.




About the Role:




We're seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to bridge the gap between our data products, data science insights and production systems. You'll be responsible for taking ML models from concept to production, building robust MLOps infrastructure, and ensuring our machine learning systems operate reliably at scale. This role focuses on the engineering aspects of ML design, deployment, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure.




What you will do:




Design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion to model serving
Build automated model training, validation, and deployment workflows using CI/CD best practices
Develop and maintain MLOps infrastructure for model versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment
Create robust monitoring and alerting systems for model performance, data drift, and system health
Optimize model inference performance and cost for production workloads
Collaborate with our Data Engineers to design and implement feature stores and feature pipelines
Develop automated data quality checks and validation frameworks for ML pipelines
Build scalable feature engineering workflows that support both batch and real-time inference
Implement data versioning and lineage tracking for reproducible ML workflows
Partner with Software Data Scientists to productionize research models and experiments
Implement frameworks for model evaluation and gradual rollouts
Design automated retraining pipelines and model refresh strategies
Establish best practices for model governance, documentation, and compliance
Work closely with Software Engineers to integrate ML capabilities into existing applications
Contribute to architectural decisions for scalable, maintainable ML systems
Participate in code reviews, documentation, and knowledge sharing across teams
Mentor junior engineers on ML engineering best practices




The right person for this role will have:




3+ years of experience in machine learning engineering, MLOps, or related fields
Strong proficiency in Python for ML development and automation
Solid SQL skills for data manipulation and analysis
Hands-on experience with AWS or other cloud platforms (Azure, or GCP) and their ML services
Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for ML workloads
Proficiency with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and MLOps tools
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code principles
Databricks experience is a plus
Experience with feature engineering at scale and feature store implementations
Understanding of model monitoring, observability, and production ML challenges
Knowledge of data quality frameworks and automated testing for ML systems
Familiarity with distributed computing frameworks (Databricks or Sagemaker) for large-scale ML
Experience with experiment tracking and model versioning tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases, etc.)




Bonus points if you have:




Master's or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or related quantitative field Experience with real-time ML inference and streaming data pipelines
Knowledge of AutoML platforms and automated hyperparameter tuning
Familiarity with model compression, quantization, and edge deployment Experience with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud ML architectures
Contributions to open-source ML tools or platforms




Our guiding principles:




Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company.
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact.
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep.
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email.
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term.
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated.




Compensation and benefits:




Compensation range of $145k to $200K annually
Employee stock options based on experience level
Comprehensive health benefits, including Lifestyle Spending Account
4 weeks of paid vacation per year
Work anywhere in the world for 60 days of the year




Application process:

Please submit your resume highlighting relevant experience and include a cover letter explaining your interest in the specific role
Provide links to relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or publications
Be prepared to discuss technical projects and problem-solving approaches in interviews

Location: Our office is located at #150 - 4611 Viking Way, just off the No. 6 Road exit on the east-west connector in Richmond, BC, Canada. Lots of free parking is available and a bus stop is one block away.




This is a hybrid role. We love seeing folks in the office 2+ times a week; you’re welcome to work from home the remainder of the week or come into the office all 5 days if you prefer. Our “be an adult” approach means you have the flexibility to determine your in-office schedule while factoring in the positive impact of face-to-face connection and communication with your leader and teammates.




Hours of work: 8 hrs/day, M-F. Typical working hours are 9AM-5PM-ish pacific time; some employees shift slightly earlier or later based on business and personal needs. As Ideon is a high technology company, you may be asked to be flexible with your hours due to business requirements.

What We Offer




Salary: The annual salary range for this role, in Canadian dollars, is $140,000 - $200,000.




Equity option allocations upon hire plus the opportunity to earn performance-based option allocations annually.
Accreditation and tuition support.
Extended health and dental benefits, an employee assistance program, and a health/personal spending account to cover things that may not fall into other categories (i.e. exercise classes, transit, daycare, pet insurance).
An annual paid closure between the Christmas and New Year’s stat holidays, in addition to vacation time.
5 paid sick days annually, in addition to other leaves per employment standards legislation.
Parental leave top-up.

Ideon’s salary ranges are determined by role and level and are benchmarked against companies of similar size and stage in the Vancouver, BC, Canada market. The range reflects the minimum and maximum new employee salary. It is not typical for a new employee to be hired at the top of the range; as experienced as someone may be they likely won’t have the directly related experience unique to working at Ideon. In exceptional circumstances, though, where a person has the knowledge, skills, and experience to exceed those needed for the position, we may consider compensating at the top of the range. In the application process you will be asked to provide your salary expectations.

Meroka is building the future of independent medicine in the United States. We provide operations, finance, tech, and strategic support to physician-owned practices-helping them grow sustainably and with soul. This is in addition to support for physicians transitioning ownership to the employees of the business.

We believe in clear communication, practical systems, thoughtful design, and long-term thinking. Our tone is warm, grounded, and confident-but never corporate or clinical.

❌ This Role Is Not for You If…


You only want to train models rather than build end to end AI powered workflows
You are uncomfortable integrating third party systems like EHR, billing, accounting, and HR software
You prefer to work in research mode rather than shipping production ready features
You want rigid specifications instead of working iteratively with product and operations teams
You avoid regulated industries where compliance and auditability are critical


✅ What You’ll Do


Agentic Workflow Design: Build and deploy AI powered agents that connect across billing, finance, HR, payroll, and other practice systems to give users a single operational login
System Integration: Work with APIs and data pipelines to connect EHR, billing, and accounting software seamlessly into the Meroka platform
Applied AI Automation: Translate repetitive operational tasks into AI driven workflows that save time for practice staff and physicians
User Facing Product Development: Collaborate with designers and product managers to ensure AI powered features are intuitive, reliable, and trusted by users
Compliance and Security: Design systems with HIPAA, SOC 2, and healthcare regulatory requirements built in from the start
Cross Functional Collaboration: Partner with operations, finance, and enablement teams to identify high impact workflows to automate and improve


🧠 We’re Looking For Someone Who…


Has 3 or more years of experience in software engineering with exposure to AI or agentic frameworks
Is fluent in building integrations with third party APIs and cloud based SaaS platforms
Brings strong programming skills in Python, TypeScript, or similar languages
Has experience working with LLMs and AI orchestration frameworks (LangChain, OpenAI tools, etc)
Understands how to build user facing applications with reliability, transparency, and auditability
Can work closely with product and design to deliver features that feel seamless to non technical users
Thrives in early stage environments where speed, ownership, and clarity are essential


💰 What We Offer


Competitive compensation and health benefits
Unlimited vacation and flexible working arrangements
The opportunity to shape the first AI powered workflows that unify all practice operations in one platform
Ownership of core features that directly impact how independent physician practices run every day
A thoughtful, ambitious team that values pragmatism, clarity, and long term thinking


🌍 Additional Notes


This role will require occasional travel to the USA and Canada for on-site campaigns, team collaboration, and brand activations. All travel will be coordinated and supported by the Meroka team.


📣 How To Apply


Send us your CV and examples of integrations, workflows, or AI powered features you have built. Bonus points if you include a Loom video walking us through a project where you automated a complex workflow or unified multiple systems into one user experience.

Ideon’s salary ranges are determined by role and level and are benchmarked against companies of similar size and stage in the Vancouver, BC, Canada market. The range reflects the minimum and maximum new employee salary. It is not typical for a new employee to be hired at the top of the range; as experienced as someone may be they likely won’t have the directly related experience unique to working at Ideon. In exceptional circumstances, though, where a person has the knowledge, skills, and experience to exceed those needed for the position, we may consider compensating at the top of the range. In the application process you will be asked to provide your salary expectations.

          <p>Founded and based in Richmond, BC, Ideon Technologies uses the energy from supernova explosions in space to image deep beneath the Earth’s surface.&nbsp;The&nbsp;world pioneer in cosmic-ray muon tomography, Ideon has developed the REVEAL™ Subsurface Intelligence Platform™, comprising an advanced suite of proprietary data-generation hardware, software, AI-powered services, and multi-physics fusion that provide x-ray-like visibility deep underground and unlock the exponential power of integrated spatial data.</p><p><br></p><p>By transforming muon data into reliable 3D density maps, Ideon helps geologists identify, map, characterize, and monitor mineral deposits with confidence. This reduces risk and cost of traditional methods, while saving time, optimizing return, and minimizing environmental impact across the mining value chain. In turn, this is helping accelerate the world’s transition to low-impact mining and transform how companies recover the critical minerals required to power the global shift to clean energy – improving peoples’ lives and enhancing economic prosperity.
