Replica provides data about the built environment and ways people interact with it. With better data, human-context and an intuitive design, Replica helps public and private sectors make informed, effective, and responsive decisions. By showing how people live, move and work, we contextualize hard choices, allowing our clients to see around corners and understand the trade-offs surrounding their decisions. Whether for a city planner increasing public transit to underserved neighborhoods or for a grocery chain evaluating where to open a new location, Replica’s insights lets clients make more informed, people-centered decisions.

We spun out of Alphabet in 2019 and recently secured series B funding from venture firms including Founders Fund, Innovation Endeavors, Sidewalk Labs, Firebrand Ventures, and Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund. Today, we are a team of 34 employees with offices in San Francisco, New York, Kansas City and Remote.

We value our customers, believe in being resourceful, and work in service of each other to scale our product. As we build our team, we are committed to pursuing and bringing together a diverse workforce and creating an environment of inclusion. We value our differences and we encourage all to apply. We are committed to equal opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, gender, gender identity, parental or pregnancy status, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, Veteran status, or any other status protected by the laws or regulations in the locations where we operate.

Description

Are you excited to create efficiencies by automating processes through coding and AI Agents?

Do you love turning messy data into useful tools and dashboards?

Can you build with Python and Power BI and experiment with LLMs to make smart smarter?

Want your work used by real stakeholders the same week you ship it?

Overview

Join Internal Audit to prototype automation that speeds audit work and improves insight. You’ll use Python, SQL, and Power BI—and try LLMs/RAG—to transform enterprise data into reusable analytics, lightweight apps, and draft workpapers. You’ll pair with a mentor, collaborate with auditors, and ship practical solutions .

What You’ll Do


Build data prep scripts (Python/SQL): Ingest, clean, reconcile, and document datasets for repeatable use.
Create dashboards (Power BI): Model data (Power Query/M, DAX) and publish clear visuals and metrics.
Prototype AI helpers (LLMs/RAG): Summarize policies, extract facts from documents, draft outlines/checklists—with citations and an audit trail.
Translate problems into code: Work with auditors to frame questions, test ideas, and iterate quickly.
Document & QA: Track assumptions, lineage, and tests; communicate results to non-technical users.


Example projects: anomaly detection on transactional data, contract/PO/lease summarization, exception classification, remediation status roll-ups, lightweight notification bots, or automating a recurring data pull.

Basic Qualifications (Must-Haves)


Education: currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Data/Computer Science, Information Systems, Accounting/Analytics, or related field.
Python: pandas/numpy basics; comfortable writing clear, reusable scripts.
Power BI: Power Query/M and basic DAX; can build and publish dashboards from scratch.
Microsoft 365: Strong Excel; working knowledge of SharePoint/OneDrive file management and Teams collaboration (Power Automate a plus).
Clear communicator; resourceful and creative problem solver who learns fast.


Preferred Qualifications (Nice-to-Haves)


SQL fundamentals (joins, filtering, aggregation).
Interest in LLMs/RAG (grounding, citations) and document parsing (PDF/OCR).
Familiarity with enterprise data (ERP, expenses, timesheets, GRC) is a plus.


What You’ll Learn


How to scope ambiguous problems and ship usable tools fast.
The audit analytics lifecycle—from raw data to reproducible insight.
Data quality, change management, and documentation standards in a regulated environment.
All the exciting projects Leidos is developing to make the world safer, smarter, and more efficient.


At Leidos, we don’t want someone who ""fits the mold""—we want someone who melts it down and builds something better. This is a role for the restless, the over-caffeinated, the ones who ask, “what’s next?” before the dust settles on “what’s now.”

If you’re already scheming step 20 while everyone else is still debating step 2… good. You’ll fit right in.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


PhD + 3 years, MS/MA + 6 years or BS/BA 8 years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$172,000 - CA$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Comfortable with ambiguity and capable of navigating complex stakeholder relationships.
Able to communicate your ideas clearly and succinctly with the right amount of detail to audiences with varying technical backgrounds.


Generally, our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options.
