Programming experience with Python, SQL.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
Interest in AI, natural language processing, or data visualisation.

Exposure to cloud platforms (AWS, Docker) or CI/CD principles.
Previous projects involving NLP, machine learning, automation, or dashboard design.




Why Apply?




Impact: Contribute directly to shaping an AI-driven product used by leading brands.
Learning: Gain hands-on experience with modern AI tools and frameworks, working closely with the founding team.

This includes building predictive models with uncertainty estimates, improving model performance through rigorous evaluation, and creating data pipelines to support modelling and analytics. You’ll also prototype processes downstream of valuation models, such as optimization approaches, to enhance pricing strategies, collaborating with stakeholders to integrate these solutions into business processes.
Price optimization & forecasting for goods: Develop machine learning models to forecast demand and optimize pricing strategies for goods sold by a portfolio company. You’ll build predictive models that incorporate seasonality and competitive pricing data, while quantifying uncertainty and maintaining model explainability to support robust, transparent decision-making.




Your Experience:

We’re a small, high-impact team with a broad remit and diverse technical backgrounds. We don’t expect any single candidate to check every box below - if your experience overlaps strongly with what we do and you’re excited to apply your skills in a fast-moving, real-world environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Strong technical foundation: Degree in a STEM field (or equivalent experience) with hands-on expertise in a least two of applied statistics, machine learning, forecasting, NLP, or optimization. Experience with uncertainty quantification, model evaluation, and statistical inference is highly valued.
Python expertise: Skilled in building data pipelines and ML models using modern libraries across multiple domains:

Research mindset with business impact: Ability to translate complex problems into tractable modelling approaches. Strong problem-solving skills, intellectual curiosity, and a pragmatic approach to delivering solutions that drive measurable business value.
Collaboration and Communication: Demonstrated experience working in collaborative development environments using tools like Git and Azure DevOps. Comfortable contributing to shared codebases, participating in code reviews, and managing branches and CI/CD workflows. Proven ability to work cross-functionally with data scientists, engineers, and non-technical stakeholders to translate business needs into technical solutions and ensure successful delivery and adoption.










About Us:

We are a new, but growing team of AI specialists- data scientists, software engineers, and technology strategists - working to transform how an alternative investment firm with $65B in assets under management leverages technology and data. Our remit is broad, spanning investment operations, portfolio companies, and internal systems, giving the team the opportunity to shape the way the firm approaches analytics, automation, and decision-making.

This role sits at the heart of our platform and infrastructure strategy. You’ll be responsible for identifying the best approaches to model deployment, building scalable infrastructure using Terraform, and ensuring that the entire ML lifecycle - from experimentation to production - runs smoothly and cost-effectively.




Key Responsibilities




Design and implement scalable, automated infrastructure for deploying ML models in AWS, using Terraform as the primary provisioning tool.
Manage and optimise existing AWS environments (SageMaker, ECS/EKS, Lambda, Batch, and GPU-backed instances).
Build and maintain CI/CD pipelines for ML model delivery and monitoring.
Ensure the infrastructure can support both real-time inference and batch processing workloads.
Collaborate closely with Data Scientists and Engineers to productionise models efficiently.
Monitor system performance and cost, identifying opportunities for optimisation and automation.
Maintain infrastructure security, reliability, and compliance with best practices.




Essential Skills & Experience




Extensive hands-on experience with Terraform, including provisioning and managing complex AWS infrastructure.
Strong knowledge of AWS services relevant to ML Ops:
SageMaker for model training and deployment
ECS/EKS or Elastic Beanstalk for containerised workloads
Lambda and Batch for inference pipelines
S3, CloudWatch, IAM, Glue, and related orchestration tools
Proven experience deploying GPU-accelerated models in production.
Solid understanding of ML model lifecycle management, including versioning, packaging, and scaling.
Competence in Python and experience with frameworks such as FastAPI or Flask for serving models.
Strong understanding of CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and DevOps principles.




Desirable Skills




AWS Certified (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer, or Machine Learning Specialty).
Terraform Certification.
Familiarity with Kubernetes, Docker, and MLflow.
Experience in cost optimisation and performance tuning within AWS.




What We’re Looking For




This is a critical role - the infrastructure you build underpins the company’s ability to deliver and scale its AI products. We’re looking for someone who combines strong technical expertise with sound judgment and reliability. You should be confident working autonomously in production environments where infrastructure changes can have major impact.

About The Role


We are looking for a data scientist who understands financial markets to build real-time pricing systems that produce high-integrity references prices across thousands of assets. As a member of this team, you’ll design the models and detection logic that keep those prices trustworthy under stress.


Your Impact


You’ll build real-time pricing systems.
You’ll model complex, adversarial markets to understand where risk originates.
When incidents occur, you’ll lead the data forensics (pre/post-trade analysis, benchmark vs. pool price deltas, liquidity gaps), quantify user impact, and ship fixes that measurably reduce recurrence.


Requirements


Working knowledge of core DeFi primitives and how they generate on-chain signals.
Oracle literacy: how on/off-chain price feeds are constructed (CEX/DEX sourcing, outlier trimming, medians/TWAPs), and common failure modes (staleness, rubber-banding/instability, flatlining, thin-liquidity manipulation, flash-loan driven spikes).
On-chain data fluency: reading EVM logs/traces, ABIs and token standards (ERC-20/721/1155), identifying swaps/transfers/liquidations in event streams, and understanding subgraph/indexing patterns.
Blockchain fundamentals that impact alerting: block production/finality/reorgs, mempool dynamics, gas markets, and chain-specific latency characteristics that influence MTTD/MTTR and false positives.
Market microstructure awareness: liquidity depth, slippage, pool imbalance, funding rates/open interest (for perps), and how these drive benchmark construction and deviation alerts.


Preferred Requirements


Hands-on with Chainlink data products (Data Feeds/Mercury/Streams/CCIP) and oracle attack surfaces; prior incident response or post-mortem work on price/peg/latency events.
Ability to read simple smart contracts (Solidity/Rust) to validate event schemas; experience operating against major RPC providers and with indexing stacks (subgraphs, BigQuery public chains).
Experience designing anomaly detection for financial time series and standing up SLO-driven alerting with Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana/Flink + on-call tools (PagerDuty).

As a Care Home Manager at HC-One, you’ll value kindness above all. It touches upon every aspect of our Dementia, Nursing, Residential and Specialist care homes.

By joining HC-One, as a Care Home Manager, you’ll have a wonderful opportunity to give something back to those people.

In this role you will take responsibility for the well-being of our Residents, including making sure their physical, emotional and social needs are met. Leading, motivating and mentoring your team and delivering clinical guidance and training to ensure the safe, smooth and efficient running of the care home. Carrying out assessments, developing, implementing and evaluating individualised care plans for each of our Residents.

All colleagues are required to attend safeguarding training appropriate to their role and to undertake additional training in associated areas. You also have the ability to seek appropriate advice and report concerns, including escalation if action is not taken.

Artificial Intelligence can be a useful tool to support your application, however, all examples and statements provided must be truthful, factually accurate and taken directly from your own experience. Where plagiarism has been identified (presenting the ideas and experiences of others, or generated by artificial intelligence, as your own) applications may be withdrawn and internal candidates may be subject to disciplinary action. Please see our candidate guidance for more information on appropriate and inappropriate use.

Sift

The sift is due to take place week commencing 17th November 2025.

As part of the application process, you will be asked to include a CV and a 500-word personal statement. The personal statement should then align with the person specification.

Interview

GPA policy is for interviews to be held face to face, with virtual interviews only by absolute exception. The date and location will be confirmed if you are invited to interview. If you feel this will be a problem for you, please contact recruitment@gpa.gov.uk to discuss prior to submitting your application.

At interview, applicants will be scored against 4 behaviours - Working Together, Managing A Quality Service, Making Effective Decisions, and Changing & Improving.

Interview questions will be a blend of Behaviour, Experience, and Technical (core skill) questions.

Further Information

A reserve list may be held for a period of 12 months from which further appointments can be made.

Any move to GPA from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may however be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare; for further information visit the Childcare Choices website.

Reasonable Adjustment

If a person with disabilities is put at a substantial disadvantage compared to a non-disabled person, we have a duty to make reasonable changes to our processes.

If you need a change to be made so that you can make your application, you should:

Contact Government Recruitment Service via gparecruitment.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk as soon as possible before the closing date to discuss your needs.

Complete the ‘Assistance required’ section in the ‘Additional requirements’ page of your application form to tell us what changes or help you might need further on in the recruitment process. For instance, you may need wheelchair access at interview, or if you’re deaf, a Language Service Professional.

If successful and transferring from another Government Department a criminal record check may be carried out.

In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service on your behalf.

However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.

New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.

Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant’s details held on the IFD will be refused employment.

A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.

At HC-One, kindness is at the heart of everything we do across our Dementia, Nursing, Residential and Specialist care homes. Our residents are people with their own stories to tell, and by joining us you’ll have the chance to give something back while helping them live with dignity and purpose.

This vacancy is full-time 33 hours per week on nights.

We’re looking for an enthusiastic and committed Care Assistant to join our team. Working under the guidance of a Registered Nurse, you’ll support the physical, emotional and social wellbeing of our residents. This includes personal care such as washing, dressing, hygiene and meals, as well as helping with daily activities in the home.

You’ll deliver care that comes from the heart — making sure residents never lose their individuality. Whether you’re supporting someone with limited mobility, offering comfort to a resident who is distressed, or providing compassionate end-of-life care, you’ll always put their wellbeing first.

Safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility in adult social care and therefore it is important that you are able to recognise the signs which may indicate possible abuse, harm or neglect in its different forms and know what to do if there are any concerns. All colleagues are required to attend safeguarding training appropriate to their role and to undertake additional training in associated areas. You also have the ability to seek appropriate advice and report concerns, including escalation if action is not taken.

About HC-One

At HC-One, kindness is more than a word—it’s a way of life. We believe that caring for people means caring about what matters most to them, so we can support them to live their best possible lives.

To Provide The Kindest Possible Care, Everyone At HC-One Brings And Nurtures Five Key Qualities—what We Call Kindness The HC-One Way


We are curious—asking questions, seeking to understand.
We are compassionate—walking in the shoes of others.
We are creative—finding practical ways to make things happen.
We are courageous—supporting residents to live the life they choose.
And we are dependable—people can always count on us.


We champion inclusivity, fostering a workplace where everyone feels valued, respected, and empowered to be themselves. Our diverse workforce helps us learn from one another and better reflect the communities we serve. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds into our HC-One family and prioritise inclusive working practices across everything we do.

We are also enhancing the way we support residents through digital care planning. This technology is helping us streamline care, improve outcomes, and make daily tasks more efficient. As we continue to grow our digital capabilities, we’re looking for team members who are comfortable with technology—or open to learning. You'll be supported every step of the way.

We care about our colleagues and are committed to supporting your personal and professional development. From the moment you receive a job offer, we aim for the quickest possible turnaround to get you started, with full support every step of the way. With clear career pathways, continuous professional development, and postgraduate programmes, HC-One will invest in your growth—opening up opportunities at regional and national levels.
