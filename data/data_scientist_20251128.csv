Our innovative, fully automatic camera solution enables sports teams to record matches and training sessions without a camera operator. We’re democratizing the world of sports by granting video analysis for teams on all levels—a privilege that used to be only for the few. More than 40,000 clubs in 90+ countries record their games every week.

Growing as fast as we do in Veo means that every day is different, exciting, and challenging, both on the front line and in the back office.

But that’s not the most remarkable thing about us.

Hands-on experience with real-world, large-scale machine-learning projects
Great coding skills
Skilled at both autonomous tasks and contributing to group efforts
Ability to examine details closely and critically

We are a small team based in central Copenhagen specializing in power trading and asset management across Europe and North America. Technology is at the heart of our operations, supported by a team of top-tier talent. Our setup is one of the most advanced automated and analytical trading environments for power markets in Europe – and we believe we can do even better.




The Opportunity

That is where you come in. We are looking for an outstanding Staff Machine Learning Engineer with a proven record of building real-time trading strategies that operate with high reliability in regulated industries. You’ll play a key role in developing algorithmic trading strategies that trade power on the short-term power markets in Europe. It’s a highly technical role with lots of autonomy and independent decision-making backed by a close collaboration with experienced software engineers and expert traders who understand the markets inside out.

So, if you feel energized by the intersection of markets, analytics and trading technology and you want to help build something that moves power to where it’s needed the most, then we must talk.




Responsibilities

Analyze markets and data: Use quantitative techniques to analyze market and fundamental data and identify profitable trading strategies.
Design and build strategies: Identify and build trading strategies with real-world impact.
Collaborate: Work closely with software engineers and traders on improving our algorithmic trading frameworks for real-time continuous markets and auctions.
Master the domain: Become a domain expert and understand algorithmic trading architectures and order execution logic on the short-term power markets.







Qualifications and Experience

Software Experience: Extraordinary ability to conceptualise and develop software that is well-designed and production ready. Skill in designing clean, scalable, and tested code while contributing to broader software engineering best practices. A strong command of advanced Python is essential, as we are a Python house.
Machine Learning Knowledge: Broad experience with the full lifecycle of ML development and operations, including designing and building models for cloud deployment. Experience with models specifically used for trading strategies is also a big plus.
Education: A degree with a strong technical focus, e.g., Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, or other relevant fields. We have a range of BSc, MSc, PhD and international post-doc experience across our team, and welcome excellence at all levels of qualification.
Strong Communication: Excellent problem-solving and communication skills with full professional proficiency in English. Genuine interest in learning about power markets and systems. If you already have that domain knowledge, then that is a big plus.







What We Offer

At Copenhagen Energy, we want everyone to feel like they belong and that their work matters. We believe in recognizing people’s strengths and creating a space where everyone can thrive. When you join our team, you will benefit from:

Exceptional Team: Join a team of professional and highly ambitious colleagues who continuously set the bar high, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the energy trading market.
Thrilling Growth Environment: Be a part of a young and rapidly growing company with an authentic start-up atmosphere. Here, your innovative ideas will be celebrated, and your contributions will be recognized.

Agreena is an exciting, dynamic, and purpose-oriented organisation united in a mission to mobilise farmers and corporations to unlock the value of nature and help restore the planet. While we’re rooted in agriculture, finance, and technology, our team of experts range from soil carbon scientists and software developers to market strategists and regulatory affairs experts. Over 160 employees across more than 30 nationalities are gathered under the common Agreena flag – either working from our headquarters in Copenhagen, offices in London, or remotely across Europe.

As a rapidly scaling climate agtech, Agreena provides solutions that drive both environmental and financial sustainability in farming. We have helped farmers across 20 countries in their journey from conventional agriculture to regenerative farming practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, storing it in soil. Our company offers a supportive and positive work environment with opportunities for learning, leading and growth no matter where you are in your professional journey. We believe in giving our employees a lot of responsibility, and we encourage new thinking, innovation and fun.

And This Is Where You Come In

At Agreena, we are building the technological and financial infrastructure to support farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture. We monitor, report, and verify (MRV) soil carbon at a planetary scale, creating high-integrity carbon credits to finance the green transition.

We are looking for a strategic Senior Machine Learning Engineer to build the backbone of our ""planet-scale"" intelligence platform. You won't just use models; you will build the high-performance, distributed systems that allow us to train, fine-tune, and serve them at a scale. This is a unique opportunity to apply SOTA AI to one of the most urgent challenges of our time: food security and climate change.

What You'll Build & Own


Planet-Scale ML Platform: You will drive development of our distributed ML platform using Ray, including building new capabilities and improving efficiency across our suite of pipelines. Your goal is to create a robust, scalable architecture that can process terabytes of geospatial and multi-modal data.
SOTA Model R&D: You will experiment with, train, and deploy state-of-the-art Computer Vision models (for satellite/remote sensing data) and NLP models (for processing agricultural and scientific texts) to power our MRV-platform.
Foundational Model Factory: You will build and refine our pipelines for fine-tuning foundational models (e.g., using PEFT, LoRA) to create expert models specialised in agronomy, soil science, and remote sensing.
AI Agent Ecosystem: You will pioneer the development of autonomous AI Agents. This includes building the critical observability, monitoring, and evaluation frameworks (LLM-ops) to ensure our agents are reliable, accurate, and continuously improving.


This Role Is For You If


You have 5+ years of experience in a Machine learning engineer role.
You have a deep hunger to build and ship reliable systems, not just run experiments.
You are passionate about solving hard, meaningful problems. The idea of applying your skills to climate-tech and agriculture excites you.
You are a highly collaborative and eager teammate who believes the best work happens when everyone ""goes the extra mile"" for a shared mission.
You demonstrate high levels of ownership and thrive in an environment where you are given the strategic context and the autonomy to deliver.


Core Qualifications


Demonstrable, hands-on experience building and scaling distributed ML systems. We use Ray on Anyscale, so if you have experience with Ray, that is a big plus.
Experience in training or fine-tuning SOTA models in at least one (preferably both) of the following domains: Computer Vision (CV) or Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Knowledge around the modern AI stack, including fine-tuning foundational models and an understanding of techniques like RAG, PEFT, and LoRA.
Familiarity with building agentic systems (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Pydantic AI) and the MLOps/LLM-ops tools required to monitor them (e.g., Weights & Biases, Arize, TruEra, Logfire).
Experience shipping a project from ideation to production, owning the deployment and liaising with product teams.
Technical leadership relating to internal tooling, code quality, processes and standardisation. You have led initiatives to adopt new tools and techniques.
Bonus Points: Experience with geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GIS) or a background in agriculture/climate-tech.


What’s In It For You


A unique opportunity to join and help shape a fast-growing tech scale up with the determination and ambitious mission to reverse climate change;
A truly global environment where you can collaborate and socialise with diverse and passionate colleagues;
Competitive compensation package and holidays;
Centrally located modern office in Copenhagen or London and the option to work from home a couple days a week;
Team events throughout the year;
An exciting purpose-led culture and mission;
Open communication and supportive feedback culture.

Dine primære opgaver




Udvikle og implementere generative AI-løsninger på Microsoft/Azure-platformen.
Opbygge robuste og skalerbare løsninger.
Gøre det komplekse enkelt – fra proof of concept til produktionsklare løsninger.
Dokumentere, teste, optimere og løbende forbedre AI-komponenter.
Samarbejde tæt med kolleger på tværs af kompetencer for at omsætte idéer til virkelighed.
Sikre governance, compliance og høj datasikkerhed i alt dit arbejde.




Hvem er du?




Vi forestiller os, at du er nysgerrig, selvstændig og en stærk teamplayer og samarbejdspartner. Dertil ser vi gerne, at du har: ·

Praktisk erfaring med generative AI-teknologier og relevante frameworks, især i Python.
Forståelse for ML workflows og MLOps-principper.
Kendskab til cloudplatforme, især Azure, er en klar fordel.
Motivation for at tage ansvar – både for at eksperimentere, men også levere stabil drift.
Et mindset, hvor samarbejde prioriteres, og hvor deling af viden er en selvfølge.
En nysgerrighed, der driver dig til at lære, udfordre og hele tiden løfte niveauet.




Hvem er vi?




Du vil blive en del af teamet Digital Transformation, Procesinnovation. Teamet er kendetegnet ved godt samarbejde, høj faglighed og udvikling. Vi arbejder både projektorienteret og med plads til eksperimenter. Det betyder, at vi ud over at løse konkrete projekter, prioriterer tid til at udforske og afprøve nye idéer og teknologier inden for generativ AI – så vi imødekommer organisationens behov og ønsker i forhold til brugen af GenAI, og sikrer, at vi altid er på forkant med udviklingen.




Om GenAI i Dansk Industri




Vi har gennem snart to år arbejdet målrettet med generativ AI, både via egenudviklede løsninger – hvor ”DI Chat”, der giver alle medarbejdere i DI sikker adgang til en chatløsning à la ChatGPT, er den mest udbredte og anvendte – samt gennem indkøbte produkter som eksempelvis M365 Copilot. Vi er desuden i gang med at etablere et fundament for generativ AI, hvor vi også integrerer de nyeste tendenser inden for AI-agenter. Arbejdet foregår dels i projektform og dels gennem løbende eksperimenter, så vi kan imødekomme organisationens behov og ønsker i forhold til anvendelsen af generativ AI.

We are on a mission to ensure everyone has access to medical expertise, no matter where they are.

Half the world still lacks access to quality healthcare. Even in advanced systems, outcomes are uneven, and clinicians are overwhelmed. Medical knowledge grows faster than human capacity can keep up.

Corti is building the infrastructure to close that gap. Our AI platform expands access to medical expertise, reducing errors, restoring time to clinicians, and making care more affordable, accessible, and human again.

There is no quality healthcare without a quality dialogue, and no reliable AI without a strong foundation. Help us build both.

Why Corti?

Corti is building the intelligence layer for global healthcare. We give every developer, product team, and healthcare innovator access to medical-grade AI, so the world can deliver care that is faster, safer, and more human.

Built entirely for healthcare and adjacent industries, Corti’s models are trained on real-world data and optimized for precision, safety, and regulatory trust.

Through modular APIs, teams can embed medical speech recognition, summarization, reasoning, and much more directly into healthcare products without reinventing the foundation.

We power the builders who are redefining how healthcare works, from startups creating new patient experiences to enterprises modernizing the systems that care depends on.

If you believe that AI purpose-built for medicine will define the next century of healthcare, you belong at Corti.

We are on a mission to ensure everyone has access to medical expertise, no matter where they are.

Half the world still lacks access to quality healthcare. Even in advanced systems, outcomes are uneven, and clinicians are overwhelmed. Medical knowledge grows faster than human capacity can keep up.

Corti is building the infrastructure to close that gap. Our AI platform expands access to medical expertise, reducing errors, restoring time to clinicians, and making care more affordable, accessible, and human again.

There is no quality healthcare without a quality dialogue, and no reliable AI without a strong foundation. Help us build both.

Why Corti?

Corti is building the intelligence layer for global healthcare. We give every developer, product team, and healthcare innovator access to medical-grade AI, so the world can deliver care that is faster, safer, and more human.

Built entirely for healthcare and adjacent industries, Corti’s models are trained on real-world data and optimized for precision, safety, and regulatory trust.

Through modular APIs, teams can embed medical speech recognition, summarization, reasoning, and much more directly into healthcare products without reinventing the foundation.

We power the builders who are redefining how healthcare works, from startups creating new patient experiences to enterprises modernizing the systems that care depends on.

If you believe that AI purpose-built for medicine will define the next century of healthcare, you belong at Corti.

Our product teams are cross-functional and own product discovery and delivery end-to-end.

In this role, you’ll help develop new models, implement state-of-the-art research, and contribute to translating those outputs into impactful product features. For example, you might support prototyping a new ML-based product feature in collaboration with other teams, or work on adapting cutting-edge research to Corti’s healthcare domain.

What You’ll Be Doing


Contribute to building and improving machine learning models for audio, text, and structured data.
Translate research outcomes into prototypes that can inform new product features.
Help design and implement APIs and pipelines that make ML models accessible across the organization.

We help the world's biggest brands get closer to their consumers—faster, smarter, and with a human touch - through breakthrough research powered by AI. Companies like Coca-Cola, Heineken, Unilever and more trust us to deliver consumer insights in hours, not weeks.

We are building an end-to-end AI-powered human insights platform, redefining the boundaries of qualitative research. To fuel our journey, we raised a $34.5M Series A investment from PeakSpan Capital in 2024, making it one of Denmark’s largest Series A rounds to date.

What the AI team does

We are dedicated to delivering high-quality AI products leveraging the latest tools and techniques and to serve them across our core products in a scalable way.

For this, we use classic machine learning for predictive models to deal with fraud detection, language classification, visual understanding and automating internal workflows. These make heavy use of video processing, speech-to-text and multilingual translations models and pipelines.

We also build a lot of functionality around state of the art LLMs. We treat off-the-shelf LLMs as future commodities and aim to benefit from their strengths while employing principled methodologies to build guardrails and fallback strategies for their weaknesses. We strive to achieve a deep understanding of prompt engineering, context management, and LLM behavior quirks (e.g., hallucinations, non-determinism, context management), by focusing on evaluation and observability through monitoring for latency, accuracy, and usage.

Who you are

We’re looking for a Senior AI Engineer to join our growing stellar AI team. You will be responsible for all stages in the machine learning lifecycles across projects, from designing and defining data annotation steps to model training, validation and deployment.

More Specifically, You Should Have These Minimum Qualifications


At least 5+ years developing machine learning systems.
Proficiency in Python, along with a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, and the capability to write production-quality code.
Experience designing and implementing scalable and robust machine learning pipelines for real-world use cases using cloud services on top of cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
Experience working with LLMs, Prompt Engineering and AI Agents.
Exceptional English skills, both spoken and in writing.


Preferred Qualifications


Experience using LLMs at scale.
Know what happens under the hood, as well as experience with LLM evaluation, dealing with hallucinations, inconsistent outputs, context management, conversational AI and voice technologies, including text-to-speech.
Proven experience making data-driven engineering decisions; formulating hypotheses, conducting experiments, and analyzing results.


What you will do


Build AI-powered features at scale using the latest advancements in LLMs.
Work closely with researchers, engineers, and product teams to define feature scope and implementation strategies.
Mentor junior team members and engage in collaborative learning with peers to promote knowledge sharing.
Maintain and support production services to ensure reliability and stability.
Participating in technical design discussions and promoting engineering best practices.
Writing clean, maintainable, and well-structured code to meet delivery goals.


What we offer


A highly ambitious AI team driven by sky-is-the-limit long term vision and goals, while working to identify and deliver intermediate milestones.
A full-time position with a competitive salary plus benefits.
A flexible work schedule with opportunities to work from home.
A vibrant and international work environment with 60+ colleagues from 15+ nationalities.
A modern, newly renovated Nordhavnen office with stunning waterfront views, office lunch, relaxation areas, gym, free daily energizers, snacks, and drinks.
A company culture that values innovation, collaboration, and transparency.
Annual company retreats and Friday bar events – we work hard, we celebrate hard.

Drive End-to-End Projects: You will own complex, designated product areas, guiding the team through the full research project lifecycle, from initial ideation to implementation, experimentation, and reporting.
Stay at the Forefront of Research: You will keep up with the latest advancements in the NLP and ML fields, introducing new concepts and literature as potential solutions to our business problems.
Collaborate and Peer Review: You will regularly discuss and peer-review research ideas with your colleagues, contributing to a culture of shared learning and continuous improvement.

Your location may affect eligibility and rates. Please submit your resume in English and indicate your level of English proficiency.

At Mindrift, innovation meets opportunity. We believe in using the power of collective human intelligence to ethically shape the future of AI.

What We Do

The Mindrift platform, launched and powered by Toloka, connects domain experts with cutting-edge AI projects from innovative tech clients. Our mission is to unlock the potential of GenAI by tapping into real-world expertise from across the globe.

Who we're looking for:

We're looking for curious and intellectually proactive contributors, the kind of person who double-checks assumptions and plays devil's advocate.

Are you comfortable with ambiguity and complexity? Does an async, remote, flexible opportunity sound exciting? Would you like to learn how modern AI systems are tested and evaluated?

This is a flexible, project-based opportunity well-suited for:


Analysts, researchers, or consultants with strong critical thinking skills
Students (senior undergrads / grad students) looking for an intellectually interesting gig
People open to a part-time and non-permanent opportunity


About the project:

We're on the hunt for QAs for autonomous AI agents for a new project focused on validating and improving complex task structures, policy logic, and agent evaluation frameworks. Throughout the project, you'll have to balance quality assurance, research, and logical problem-solving. This project opportunity is ideal for people who enjoy looking at systems holistically and thinking through scenarios, implications, and edge cases.

You do not need a coding background, but you must be curious, intellectually rigorous, and capable of evaluating the soundness and consistency of complex setups. If you've ever excelled in things like consulting, CHGK, Olympiads, case solving, or systems thinking — you might be a great fit.

What you'll be doing:


Reviewing evaluation tasks and scenarios for logic, completeness, and realism
Identifying inconsistencies, missing assumptions, or unclear decision points
Helping define clear expected behaviors (gold standards) for AI agents
Annotating cause-effect relationships, reasoning paths, and plausible alternatives
Thinking through complex systems and policies as a human would to ensure agents are tested properly
Working closely with QA, writers, or developers to suggest refinements or edge case coverage


How to get started:

Apply to this post, qualify, and get the chance to contribute to a project aligned with your skills, on your own schedule. Shape the future of AI while building tools that benefit everyone.

Requirements


Excellent analytical thinking: Can reason about complex systems, scenarios, and logical implications
Strong attention to detail: Can spot contradictions, ambiguities, and vague requirements
Familiarity with structured data formats: Can read, not necessarily write JSON/YAML
Ability to assess scenarios holistically: What's missing, what's unrealistic, what might break?
Good communication and clear writing (in English) to document your findings.


We also value applicants who have:


Experience with policy evaluation, logic puzzles, case studies, or structured scenario design
Background in consulting, academia, olympiads (e.g. logic/math/informatics), or research
Exposure to LLMs, prompt engineering, or AI-generated content
Familiarity with QA or test-case thinking (edge cases, failure modes, ""what could go wrong"")
Some understanding of how scoring or evaluation works in agent testing (precision, coverage, etc.)


Benefits


Get paid for your expertise, with rates that can go up to $47/hour depending on your skills, experience, and project needs
Take part in a flexible, remote, freelance project that fits around your primary professional or academic commitments
Participate in an advanced AI project and gain valuable experience to enhance your portfolio
Influence how future AI models understand and communicate in your field of expertise

At Shine, we are redefining how entrepreneurs - freelancers, self-employed professionals, and SMEs - manage their banking and administrative tasks. Through seamless tools and innovative banking solutions, we help them focus on what matters most: growing their businesses.

Our vision is to become the best friend of every small entrepreneur across Europe. 💚


Over the years, Shine has grown through the merging of top European FinTechs like Shine (🇫🇷), Kontist (🇩🇪), Tellow (🇳🇱), and more. Today, we’re a team of nearly 500 people, including 150 talented engineers, working together from Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Berlin.

The Banking team at Shine

The Banking domain is responsible for accounts, payments, cards, ledger, compliance flows, and the architecture that powers all financial operations. The mission: build a single, unified banking experience across four markets, on a new in-house core banking engine.

Ensure Shine is audit-ready at all times (PSD2, SCA, AML/KYC, SEPA, local regulators)
Your first 12 months:

You will focus on:


Building trust with the Banking teams and engineering leadership

Delivering a high-confidence migration plan from legacy BaaS systems to the new core banking engine

Aligning with Compliance and Risk to ensure regulatory correctness across all markets

Launching the new banking engine in our core markets

Improving operational excellence (SLOs, incident management, on-call, reliability culture)

Driving transparency, alignment, and crisp execution across EMs and cross-functional partners

Leading the engineering dimension of the merger between Banking and Accounting/Invoices
About you

You are a servant leader with strong engineering judgement, able to build clarity, challenge assumptions, and guide teams through ambiguity in a regulated environment.

Must-have experience

Significant leadership experience in regulated fintech, banking, or financial infrastructure
Direct ownership of core financial systems such as ledger, posting engines, payments orchestration, KYC/AML, reconciliation, or audit frameworks
Architectural leadership in cloud-native, event-driven, highly reliable systems
Experience leading platform migrations, system consolidation, or large-scale technical transformation
Strong ability to mentor, challenge, and grow Engineering Managers, Staff Engineers, and senior ICs
Experience leading multi-country product and engineering delivery
Fluent English; strong French is a major advantage
Demonstrated ability to build inclusive, high-performing, distributed engineering organisations

Nice to have

Experience with multi-market financial products
Prior exposure to European regulatory frameworks (PSD2, SCA, AML/KYC, SEPA, reporting)
Experience working with accounting, invoicing, or adjacent financial products
