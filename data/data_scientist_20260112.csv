In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth org aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision-making.
You will explore ambiguous areas and conduct analysis to identify opportunities for the Growth org, helping shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll partner closely with product, engineering, and marketing leaders at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work on different pillars across Growth.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering and growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.


Nice To Haves


You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have been a Technical Lead or Manager within Data Science teams previously.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product, engineering, and marketing peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product, engineering, and marketing leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.

Roku is changing how the world watches TV

Roku is the #1 TV streaming platform in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and we've set our sights on powering every television in the world. Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.

From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.

 

About the team

The Core Analytics Team is a centralized function dedicated to providing data-driven insights to drive business and product success. We work closely with our Product, Engineering, and Marketing teams to deliver exceptional experiences to our customers while maximizing the value proposition for the business.

 

About the role

Roku is looking for a Data Scientist to join the Core Analytics team and provide support for our Customer Intelligence function, part of the broader Planning & Optimization team. Together, we answer high-impact business questions from senior leaders with clear, decision-ready insights. You’ll work on customer analytics that directly shape how Roku grows engagement, retention and monetization across the streaming ecosystem, with visibility to cross-functional leaders and meaningful ownership over high-impact questions. 

This role is more than analytics and is intentionally “business-forward”. We're looking for someone who can translate customer behavior into metrics and narratives which can help define our customer strategy, and/or measure the impact of initiatives on customer behavior. You’ll be expected to translate ambiguous stakeholder needs into strong analytical narratives and executive-ready deliverables. Familiarity with causal inference/experimentation is important; deep specialization is a plus but not required. This is a hybrid role with four days per week in the office, Monday through Thursday.  The selected candidate will be based out of NYC. 

For New York Only - The estimated annual salary for this position is between $152,000-$184,000 annually. 

Compensation packages are based on factors unique to each candidate, including but not limited to skill set, certifications, and specific geographical location.  This role is eligible for health insurance, equity awards, life insurance, disability benefits, parental leave, wellness benefits, and paid time off. 

 

What you'll be doing 
Own end-to-end analyses: scope the question, define success metrics, pull data, analyze, synthesize, and deliver data-driven narratives. 
Drive stakeholder alignment: clarify objectives, assumptions, tradeoffs, and decision points; ensure outputs are usable. 
Build crisp storytelling & presentations: create executive-ready readouts (slides, memos) with clear “so what / now what.” 
Develop SQL and Python-based workflows: write and review SQL/Python code to create datasets, compute KPIs, and validate results; use Airflow to maintain and build new pipelines when needed. 
Create reporting in Tableau/Looker: develop dashboards or recurring scorecards that make performance tracking easier and reduce ad-hoc churn. 
Measurement & causal thinking: apply or partner on quasi-experimental approaches (e.g., diff-in-diff, propensity matching, synthetic controls) with appropriate caveats to address incrementality questions.  
Raise analytical quality: ensure statistical rigor, bias awareness, and clear limitations.  

 

We're excited if you have
3+ years (or equivalent) in analytics/data science roles driving business decisions (tech, media, marketplaces, consumer products, etc.). 
Strong SQL (joins, window functions, building analysis-ready tables, QA/validation). 
Proficiency in Excel to work with data, tables and visualization.  
Strong ability to communicate insights: structured thinking, clear writing, confident presenting to non-technical and executive audiences. 
Solid foundation in statistics (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression basics). 
Experienced with Python for analysis and data pipeline production (via Airflow). 
Hands-on experience with visualization tools like Tableau or Looker 

 

Our Hybrid Work Approach

Roku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy.

 

Benefits

Roku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.

 

Accommodations

Roku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com.

 

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002. </p><p>To learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.</p><p>By providing your information, you acknowledge that you want Roku to contact you about job roles, that you have read Roku's Applicant Privacy Notice, and understand that Roku will use your information as described in that notice.
