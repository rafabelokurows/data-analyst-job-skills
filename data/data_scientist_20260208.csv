Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Security, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As a Data Scientist as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is £99,200 - £148,800. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Why Chaucer

An established market leading Insurer, where over the past 5 years, the Chaucer Group has seen significant and successful growth. In 2019, we wrote $1.4bn of Gross Written Premium, closed 2023 with $2.7bn, and are on track to write well over $3bn in 2024.

Our approach has been immensely popular and a successful way of working for the business and all employees at Chaucer.




Chaucer is committed to diversity, actively values difference and respects people regardless of the protected characteristics which are outlined in the Equality Act 2010 (UK legislation) as a result of the Equal Treatment Directive 2006 (EU legislation).

A diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace are core to our success as a business and integral to our winning strategy and culture. We recruit from the widest available pool of talent, and our hiring, assessment and selection process is fair, free from bias and one which ensures we select the right person for the job, based on merit. We are committed to promoting a culture that actively values difference, and recognises that everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect throughout their employment.




We are open to considering flexible working arrangements for all roles and encourage you to outline your needs during the interview process.




Benefits – Extensive, non-contributory benefits, including pension, medical insurance, life insurance, flexi benefits, options for buying and selling holidays, not to mention a diverse and inclusive culture, we pride ourselves on managing employees welfare.

Kraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.

We’re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.

It’s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future.

Kraken Utilities

Our tech platform ‘Kraken’ is already licensed to support 55 million customer accounts globally, and we aim to serve 100 million by 2027. Kraken is the most AI-driven, innovative, forward-thinking platform for energy management. From optimising resources to delivering cost-effective, exceptional customer experiences through advanced Customer Information Systems (CIS), billing, meter data management, CRM, and AI-driven communications.

We’re now charging the Kraken platform to other utility industries (Water and Broadband) and have created a new team called - Kraken Utilities. Over the last 3 years we have built this team from scratch to re-architect, design, and develop our Kraken software platform to solve complex industry wide problems within the water and broadband sectors (such as customer experience & water leak detection).

The Kraken Utilities team is in a very exciting growth phase, and has already signed six key clients: Severn Trent, Leep, Portsmouth Water, Essential Energy, TalkTalk, and Cuckoo. We are currently 120+ people strong globally.

The role

This is a hands-on, delivery-focused ML engineering role. You’ll join a team working on mature, live products where the priority is shipping, improving, and maintaining features. While the role is ML-focused, our ML engineers work very close to the software layer so being comfortable with production Python code, databases, and systems is essential. You’ll initially focus on the Companion product, a RAG based chatbot, supporting feature delivery, maintenance, and incremental improvements, while collaborating closely with product managers and engineers across Kraken.

What You'll Do


Design, build, and improve machine learning and GenAI-powered features used in live production systems
Deliver consistent, high-quality work each sprint (typically 2–3 smaller tickets or 1 larger piece of work per two-week sprint)
Work with product managers to clarify requirements and translate them into robust technical solutions
Write clean, maintainable Python code and contribute to shared codebases used across ML teams
Analyse data, evaluate approaches, and iterate on solutions based on real-world usage
Collaborate with other ML engineers and software engineers across Kraken when working on shared systems
Ask questions early, seek clarification when needed, and contribute ideas during team discussions
Participate in sprint planning, stand-ups, and knowledge-sharing sessions




While our current products are largely GenAI-based and do not train models, a strong grounding in ML fundamentals is still important as the platform continues to evolve.

What You'll Need


A solid foundation in machine learning fundamentals, including data analysis, model evaluation, and ML pipelines
Strong experience with Python and SQL in a production environment
Comfort working in software-engineering-heavy ML roles (this is not a research-only position)
Experience working with real-world systems where reliability, readability, and maintainability matter
Confidence asking questions, collaborating across teams, and explaining your thinking
Ability to work independently on defined tasks and see them through to completion




Experience with the following is a bonus:



Exposure to GenAI / LLM-based systems (e.g. prompting, orchestration, evaluation)
Familiarity with cloud environments (especially AWS)
Experience with tools such as Databricks, Datadog, or similar data / observability platforms
Awareness of ML libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Hugging Face (even if not used day-to-day)




Ways of working



Two-week sprints with planning and retrospectives
Asynchronous-first communication with daily stand-ups
Regular knowledge-sharing sessions
A no-blame culture with high trust and autonomy

We’ve already cleared the way for 100,000 businesses with more than £4 billion in funding. Our passionate team is driven to help even more SMEs succeed, through access to better finance and other services that make running a business easier. Our ultimate mission is to support one million SMEs in their defining moments, creating lasting impact for the communities and economies they drive.

The team

The Repeats team is responsible for the lending product strategy and digital user experience of recurring customers. They are responsible for all the product decisions that occur after a customer has taken their first funding. This includes the user journey eligibility and documents requirements and offer terms (such as offered amount or pricing), among other things.

The role

iwoca's Data Scientists specialise in supervised machine learning, statistical inference and exploratory data analysis, focusing on tabular and time-series data. Their work emphasises quantitative predictions through the analysis of conditional probabilities and expectations, using medium-sized datasets.

Your primary focus will be to figure out the best document requirements and offer terms (pricing, amount, duration, additional product features, etc.) to maximise user conversion and value to iwoca. You will look at observational data, identify hypotheses for unknown relationships, figure out their commercial relevance, and design and implement tests to prove or disprove your theory.

Strategy and innovation:


Work closely with the Repeats team lead and tech leads to identify and quantify opportunities within the customer journey, based on past data or modelled assumptions.
Design experiments to compare the performance of different strategies and evaluate them rigorously to make unbiased decisions.
Share your findings and modelling with the wider business to impact strategy. iwoca lives and breathes data as a company, so data scientists play an important role in decision-making.


Ownership and influence:


Own some of our monitoring and data pipelines, covering all aspects of existing customers' user journey, and getting the data we need to make informed decisions.
Lead the move away from rule-based policies towards machine learning approaches to improve predictive accuracy and optimise decision-making.
Promote analytical rigour within the team, ensuring that our experimental designs are correctly defined and that we evaluate tests without bias.


Development opportunities:


Join our community of analysts/data scientists/statisticians to ensure alignment in methodology across iwoca. You’ll be part of a peer group with whom you can discuss best practices or the latest advances so that you share and deepen your technical expertise
Build expertise across the full range of the Repeats funnel, from the user journey to the lending strategy, learning to understand how customers evolve in our complex environment


The Requirements

Essential:


Expertise in probability and statistics, gained through work in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Engineering, or similar
Ability to understand business context and translate data into actionable insights that guide decisions
Proficiency with data manipulation and modelling tools such as pandas, statsmodels, or R
Experience with scientific computing tools such as NumPy or SciPy
Ability to work autonomously and manage analytical work from framing the question through to making a recommendation
Ability to communicate clearly in writing and speech, adapting technical detail to different audiences


Bonus:


Understanding of Bayesian statistics, including interest in or experience with hierarchical models
Experience building or adapting statistical or machine-learning models, with an interest in understanding the underlying methods
Familiarity with stochastic modelling concepts as they apply to inference, time series, or uncertainty
Understanding of financial concepts such as pricing or loss rates


The salary

We expect to pay from £60,000 - £80,000 for this role. But, we’re open-minded, so definitely include your salary goals with your application. We routinely benchmark salaries against market rates, and run quarterly performance and salary reviews.

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

The offices

We put a lot of effort into making iwoca a great place to work:


Offices in London, Leeds, Berlin, and Frankfurt with plenty of drinks and snacks.
Events and community-led groups, including running groups, padel, and monthly ping-pong and pool competitions.


The Benefits


Flexible working hours.
Medical insurance from Vitality, including discounted gym membership.
A private GP service (separate from Vitality) for you, your partner, and your dependents.
25 days’ holiday per year, an extra day off for your birthday, the option to buy or sell an additional five days of annual leave, and unlimited unpaid leave.
A one-month, fully paid sabbatical after four years.
Instant access to external counselling and therapy sessions for team members that need emotional or mental health support.
3% Pension contributions on total earnings.
An employee equity incentive scheme.
Generous parental leave and a nursery tax benefit scheme to help you save money.
Electric car scheme and cycle to work scheme.
Two company retreats a year: we’ve been to France, Italy, Spain, and further afield.

We create living digital representations of real-world operations (warehouses, distribution networks, global logistics) that help organisations make better decisions faster.

We're at an inflection point: moving from AI-assisted tools to domain-specific AI that understands supply chains as deeply as our best engineers do. You'll be instrumental in building our first domain-specific language model (DSLM) and the foundation for Project Genome, an ambitious initiative to capture and synthesise the world's supply chain knowledge into actionable intelligence.

This is a production engineering role first. You'll build robust Python systems that happen to train and serve LLMs, not the other way around. We need someone who writes production-quality code, debugs complex distributed systems, and thinks about reliability, who has learned ML/LLMs as powerful tools in their engineering arsenal.

You'll work across our entire AI stack: building FastAPI services that serve models, creating training pipelines that process production data, deploying inference endpoints with proper monitoring, and integrating all of this into our existing Python backend. The ML is important, but the engineering discipline is what makes it production-ready.

Learn more at kallikor.ai.

Your Opportunity


Build production AI systems: Design and implement the full stack, from FastAPI endpoints that handle requests, to training pipelines that process data, to inference services that serve predictions. You'll own the architecture, not just the model weights.
Train and deploy our DSLM: Fine-tune models using Unsloth/Axolotl, but more importantly, build the robust infrastructure around it - data pipelines that feed training, evaluation frameworks that catch regressions, deployment systems that handle failover. Make it production-grade.
Integrate ML into our backend: We use FastAPI, PydanticAI, FastMCP, Memgraph. You'll extend these systems with ML capabilities, not as a separate ""ML service"" but as a natural part of our backend architecture. Clean abstractions, proper error handling, observability.
Own inference performance: Get models running fast, whether that's vLLM deployment, quantization strategies, batching optimizations, or caching. Hit our <200ms latency targets through engineering, not just throwing bigger GPUs at it.
Shape Project Genome's foundation: Work with our Principal Engineer to architect how we ingest, process, and learn from global supply chain data. This is systems design as much as ML with data pipelines, graph databases, incremental learning strategies being just as important.
Mentor through code review and pairing: Raise the bar on code quality, testing, and production practices across the team. Teach mid and junior engineers how to build ML systems that don't fall over.


Why you're made for this


You're a strong production Python engineer: You write clean, maintainable, tested code. You understand async/await, know when to use generators vs lists, can profile performance bottlenecks. You've built FastAPI services (or similar) that handle production traffic. Your code passes review without drama.
You've built with LLMs in production: You've integrated GPT-4/Claude into real applications, handled streaming responses, dealt with rate limits and retries, cached intelligently. You know the practical challenges: prompt engineering, context management, error handling, cost control.
You've trained or fine-tuned models: Whether it's fine-tuning LLMs, training classifiers, or running experiments, you understand the workflow. You've dealt with training data quality, evaluation metrics, and overfitting. You can debug why a model isn't learning what you expected.
You think like a systems engineer: You design for failure, add instrumentation, consider edge cases. You know that ""the model works on my laptop"" isn't shipping. You care about monitoring, logging, alerting, and graceful degradation.
You can navigate the ML landscape pragmatically: You know enough about transformers, attention mechanisms, and training dynamics to make informed decisions. But you're not precious about it. If a simple heuristic beats a complex model, you ship the heuristic.
You balance velocity with quality: You ship incrementally and iterate based on production data. But you don't accumulate tech debt, you refactor proactively, write tests that matter, and leave the codebase better than you found it.
You communicate trade-offs clearly: You can explain to the team why we're choosing LoRA over full fine-tuning, why we're deploying on Fireworks instead of self-hosting, or why a 7B model might beat a 70B model. You help everyone make informed decisions.


What We're Looking For Specifically


5+ years building production Python systems (backend services, APIs, data processing)
Strong software engineering fundamentals: design patterns, testing, debugging, profiling
Experience integrating LLMs into applications (OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, prompt engineering, streaming, PydanticAI)
Understanding of ML training workflows (even if you're not an expert. You need to know enough to build the infrastructure)
Docker, CI/CD, production deployment experience
Can read and understand PyTorch code (you don't need to write novel architectures)

The Company

Small businesses move fast. Opportunities often don’t wait, and cash flow pressures can appear overnight. To keep going, and growing, SMEs need finance that’s as flexible and responsive as they are.

That's why we built iwoca. Our smart technology, data science and five-star customer service ensures business owners can act with the speed, confidence and control they need, exactly when it's needed.

We’ve already cleared the way for 100,000 businesses with more than £4 billion in funding. Our passionate team is driven to help even more SMEs succeed, through access to better finance and other services that make running a business easier. Our ultimate mission is to support one million SMEs in their defining moments, creating lasting impact for the communities and economies they drive.

The team

The Repeats team is responsible for the lending product strategy and digital user experience of recurring customers. They are responsible for all the product decisions that occur after a customer has taken their first funding. This includes the user journey eligibility and documents requirements and offer terms (such as offered amount or pricing), among other things.

The role

iwoca's Data Scientists specialise in supervised machine learning, statistical inference and exploratory data analysis, focusing on tabular and time-series data. Their work emphasises quantitative predictions through the analysis of conditional probabilities and expectations, using medium-sized datasets.

Your primary focus will be to figure out the best document requirements and offer terms (pricing, amount, duration, additional product features, etc.) to maximise user conversion and value to iwoca. You will look at observational data, identify hypotheses for unknown relationships, figure out their commercial relevance, and design and implement tests to prove or disprove your theory.

Strategy And Innovation


Work closely with the Repeats team lead and tech leads to identify and quantify opportunities within the customer journey, based on past data or modelled assumptions.
Design experiments to compare the performance of different strategies and evaluate them rigorously to make unbiased decisions.
Share your findings and modelling with the wider business to impact strategy. iwoca lives and breathes data as a company, so data scientists play an important role in decision-making.


Ownership And Influence


Own some of our monitoring and data pipelines, covering all aspects of existing customers' user journey, and getting the data we need to make informed decisions.
Lead the move away from rule-based policies towards machine learning approaches to improve predictive accuracy and optimise decision-making.
Promote analytical rigour within the team, ensuring that our experimental designs are correctly defined and that we evaluate tests without bias.


Development Opportunities


Join our community of analysts/data scientists/statisticians to ensure alignment in methodology across iwoca. You’ll be part of a peer group with whom you can discuss best practices or the latest advances so that you share and deepen your technical expertise
Build expertise across the full range of the Repeats funnel, from the user journey to the lending strategy, learning to understand how customers evolve in our complex environment


Essential

The requirements


Expertise in probability and statistics, gained through work in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Engineering, or similar
Ability to understand business context and translate data into actionable insights that guide decisions
Proficiency with data manipulation and modelling tools such as pandas, statsmodels, or R
Experience with scientific computing tools such as NumPy or SciPy
Ability to work autonomously and manage analytical work from framing the question through to making a recommendation
Ability to communicate clearly in writing and speech, adapting technical detail to different audiences


Bonus


Understanding of Bayesian statistics, including interest in or experience with hierarchical models
Experience building or adapting statistical or machine-learning models, with an interest in understanding the underlying methods
Familiarity with stochastic modelling concepts as they apply to inference, time series, or uncertainty
Understanding of financial concepts such as pricing or loss rates


The salary

We expect to pay from £60,000 - £80,000 for this role. But, we’re open-minded, so definitely include your salary goals with your application. We routinely benchmark salaries against market rates, and run quarterly performance and salary reviews.

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

The offices

We put a lot of effort into making iwoca a great place to work:


Offices in London, Leeds, Berlin, and Frankfurt with plenty of drinks and snacks.
Events and community-led groups, including running groups, padel, and monthly ping-pong and pool competitions.


The Benefits


Flexible working hours.
Medical insurance from Vitality, including discounted gym membership.
A private GP service (separate from Vitality) for you, your partner, and your dependents.
25 days’ holiday per year, an extra day off for your birthday, the option to buy or sell an additional five days of annual leave, and unlimited unpaid leave.
A one-month, fully paid sabbatical after four years.
Instant access to external counselling and therapy sessions for team members that need emotional or mental health support.
3% Pension contributions on total earnings.
An employee equity incentive scheme.
Generous parental leave and a nursery tax benefit scheme to help you save money.
Electric car scheme and cycle to work scheme.
Two company retreats a year: we’ve been to France, Italy, Spain, and further afield.


And to make sure we all keep learning, we offer:


A learning and development budget for everyone.
Company-wide talks with internal and external speakers.
Access to learning platforms like Treehouse.
