Develop and maintain dashboards and monitoring tools to track key safety and risk metrics
Produce clear, data-driven insights and recommendations, and communicate findings to cross-functional stakeholders
Support the evolution of metrics and measurement frameworks for Integrity products under guidance from senior team members
Contribute to improving data quality, pipelines, and analytical infrastructure related to trust and safety use cases




You’ll need:
Bachelor’s degree or equivalent in a quantitative field, Master’s degree or PhD with a social science background preferred. 
1-2 years of professional working experience in Data Science and/or analytics preferred. 
Experience with SQL and data visualization tools (e.g. Tableau or Mode) is a plus, not required
Familiarity with scripting languages (e.g., Python or R) and applied statistical methods; experience with A/B testing is a plus
Exposure to causal inference concepts or methods is a plus
Ability to develop a nuanced business understanding, testable hypotheses, and significant findings from data. 
Eagerness to identify and explore new product opportunities, potential improvements to our data infrastructure, and unanswered questions about member behavior. 
Comfort using descriptive and inferential statistics. 
Curiosity of how things work, from both a business and technical perspective. 
A collaborative growth mindset with a dedication to community-based projects and partnerships. 




As a full-time employee, you’ll enjoy:
Unlimited PTO (with no waiting period), 10 annual Wellness Days

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth org aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision-making.
You will explore ambiguous areas and conduct analysis to identify opportunities for the Growth org, helping shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll partner closely with product, engineering, and marketing leaders at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work on different pillars across Growth.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)

You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

Nice To Haves


You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have been a Technical Lead or Manager within Data Science teams previously.

The Intelligence and Investigations team seeks to rapidly identify and mitigate abuse and strategic risks to ensure a safe online ecosystem. We are dedicated to identifying emerging abuse trends, analyzing risks, and working with our internal and external partners to implement effective mitigation strategies to protect against misuse. Our efforts contribute to OpenAI's overarching goal of developing AI that benefits humanity.

The Strategic Intelligence & Analysis (SIA) team provides safety intelligence for OpenAI’s products by monitoring, analyzing, and forecasting real-world abuse, geopolitical risks, and strategic threats. Our work informs safety mitigations, product decisions, and partnerships, ensuring OpenAI’s tools are deployed securely and responsibly across critical sectors.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist, you will lead econometric and experimental analysis to understand how risk changes in complex human–AI systems. Your work will focus on measuring the magnitude and impact of risk shifts in a fast-paced, rapidly evolving operational environment. You will design experiments and observational studies to identify causal drivers and analyze changes in risk across a wide range of surfaces and sources. Your analyses will directly inform prioritization and strategic risk management across the company.

This role is based in San Francisco, CA (hybrid, 3 days/week). Relocation support is available

In This Role, You Will


Own the design and execution of experimental and observational analyses used to assess strategic risk
Develop econometric approaches to estimate the impact of product, policy, and external developments on key risk vectors
Translate strategic risk questions into testable hypotheses and sound study designs
Design and deploy A/B tests, as well as pseudo-experimental studies, to measure changes in risks and understand underlying mechanisms
Identify, test, and explain product-driven, event-driven, or signal-driven changes in risk
Establish baselines and statistical confidence around core metrics to size these problems
Partner across teams to track strategic risks, identify opportunities for intervention, and develop analyses to evaluate those interventions


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


Have 3–6+ years in econometrics, causal inference, or experimental research
Are comfortable owning ambiguous analyses with large-scale influence
Are strong in experimental design, observational methods, and statistical reasoning
Write solid Python and SQL
Experience delivering zero-to-one analyses and scaling them from concept through deployment
Communicate data-driven findings clearly, including uncertainty and trade-offs, to non-technical partners and leadership
Nice to have: experience in trust and safety, integrity, operational security, intelligence analysis or other quantitative risk-focused domains

Investigate and resolve model behavior issues, production regressions, calibration drift, and performance anomalies in close partnership with Ads Infra teams.
Drive innovation by staying current with advances in ML for ranking, recommendation, causal inference, optimization, and ads measurement — and proactively identifying opportunities to apply them.
Contribute to Lyft Ads’ modeling and experimentation infrastructure, through model cards, documentation, reproducibility standards, and code quality improvements.


Experience:


Master’s, or PhD in Machine Learning, Computer Science, Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Engineering, or related quantitative fields; or equivalent applied industry experience.
3–5 years of hands-on ML/applied science experience, ideally involving production models, large-scale systems, or ads/recommendation/relevance domains. Strong proficiency in Python and machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, or scikit-learn; ability to write clean, efficient, production-adjacent code.

A/B testing methodologies
Bias correction and counterfactual estimation
Ability to solve ambiguous problems by structuring analyses, evaluating trade-offs, and proposing algorithmic solutions grounded in scientific rigor.
Strong communication skills, with an ability to clearly explain model behavior, constraints, trade-offs, and recommendations to engineering, product, and sales partners.
Demonstrated ownership of modeling work, including debugging, monitoring, documentation, and iteration after deployment.
Curiosity, initiative, and a track record of delivering measurable improvements through high-quality modeling.


Benefits:


Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options with additional programs available when enrolled
Mental health benefits
Family building benefits
Child care and pet benefits
401(k) plan to help save for your future

Unlearners are gritty; we never give up, setbacks just make us try harder.
Unlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo
Unlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too important to be boring. And, last but not least,

Docusign brings agreements to life. Over 1.5 million customers and more than a billion people in over 180 countries use Docusign solutions to accelerate the process of doing business and simplify people’s lives. With intelligent agreement management, Docusign unleashes business-critical data that is trapped inside of documents. Until now, these were disconnected from business systems of record, costing businesses time, money, and opportunity. Using Docusign’s Intelligent Agreement Management platform, companies can create, commit, and manage agreements with solutions created by the #1 company in e-signature and contract lifecycle management (CLM).

What you'll do

We’re looking for a strategic, execution-minded Growth Data Scientist to be the data science engine behind Docusign’s self-serve retention motion — ensuring our customers stay active, get value, and renew through intuitive, data-driven product and lifecycle experiences. Partnering closely with a cross-functional squad — including Growth, Product, Lifecycle Marketing, Customer Success, Engineering, and Strategy & Ops — you will use data and insights to help build and scale the systems that prevent churn and drive durable customer value.

You will lead strategic analyses and hands-on experimentation to uncover, validate, and scale new ways to reduce active and partial churn by improving usage, value realization, plan fit, and save-flows. You will sit at the center of Docusign’s retention strategy, translating behavioral signals, product telemetry, and customer intent into decisions that shape how customers stay, downgrade, upgrade, or renew.

In this high-impact, hands-on role, you will own retention performance readouts, design and analyze cancel-save and customer lifecycle experiments, and deliver clear, compelling insights that directly inform product, marketing, and go-to-market execution. You will help Docusign evolve to a proactive, intelligent, and customer-centric retention engine — where the right intervention happens at the right moment in the customer journey.

Our ideal candidate combines best-in-class analytical skills, a strong strategic mindset with a bias for execution, a passion for experimentation and continuous learning, and a proven record of turning usage, churn signals, and customer behavior into measurable retention and revenue impact.

This position is an individual contributor role reporting to the Director, Growth Analytics.

Identify growth opportunities and risks, using forecasting and scenario modeling to guide resource allocation and prioritization
Apply advanced analytical techniques (e.g., predictive modeling, customer segmentation, LTV analysis) to understand customer behavior, forecast outcomes, and inform strategic initiatives


Job Designation

Hybrid: Employee divides their time between in-office and remote work. Access to an office location is required. (Frequency: Minimum 2 days per week; may vary by team but will be weekly in-office expectation)

Experience with SQL plus Python or R, and strong command of visualization tools such as Tableau, Looker, or equivalent
Demonstrated ability to distill complex analytical findings into concise, actionable recommendations for executive audiences

Prior partnership with Growth Product Management or Marketing, influencing strategy through data‑driven insights.

The Applied team safely brings OpenAI's technology to the world. We released ChatGPT; Plugins; DALL·E; and the APIs for GPT-4, GPT-3, embeddings, and fine-tuning. We also operate inference infrastructure at scale. There's a lot more on the immediate horizon.

Our customers build fast-growing businesses around our APIs, which power product features that were never before possible. ChatGPT is a prime example of what is currently possible. We simultaneously ensure that our powerful tools are used responsibly. Safe deployment is more important to us than unfettered growth.

The Scaled Abuse team works within our Applied Engineering organization identifying and responding to fraudsters on our platform. We are looking for a data scientist with anti fraud & abuse experience to help architect and build our next-generation anti-abuse systems.

About The Role

The Platform Abuse team protects OpenAI’s products from abuse. In the data scientist role, you will be responsible for discovering and mitigating new types of misuse, and scaling our detection techniques and processes. Platform Abuse is an especially exciting area since we believe most of the ways our technologies will be abused haven’t even been invented yet.

This role is based in our San Francisco HQ. We offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Design and build systems for fraud detection and remediation while balancing fraud loss, cost of implementation, and customer experience
Work closely with finance, security, product, research, and trust & safety operations to holistically combat fraudulent and abusive actors on our system
Stay abreast of the latest techniques and tools to stay several steps ahead of determined and well resourced adversaries
Utilize GPT-5 and future models to more effectively combat fraud and abuse


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


Have experience on a highly technical trust and safety team and/or have worked closely with policy, content moderation, or security teams
Can use coding languages (Python preferred) to programmatically explore large datasets and generate actionable insights to solve problems
Proven ability to propose, design, and run rigorous experiments (A/B tests, quasi-experiments, simulations) with clear insights and actionable product recommendations, leveraging SQL and Python.
Excellent communication skills with a track record of influencing cross-functional partners, including product managers, engineers, policy leads, and executives.
Bonus if you have experience with deploying scaled detection solutions using large language models, embeddings, or fine tuning
5+ years of quantitative experience in ambiguous environments, ideally as a data scientist at a hyper-growth company or research org, with exposure to fraud, abuse, or security problems.
